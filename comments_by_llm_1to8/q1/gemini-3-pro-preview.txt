  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-specific (glass artist perceiving through temperature and form), with micro-choices that reveal her adaptation from aesthetic to survival mode. The internal contradiction between fear and the need to understand is embodied through her trembling hands and her waiting for the right viscosity moment. However, key emotional shifts rely on slightly elevated diction ("hyper-aware survival mechanism," "deepest motivation") that edges toward telling rather than pure embodiment. The final resolve feels earned but the journey leans on reflective summary in places where a sharper micro-choice might have charged the closure beat more.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation (translating silence into music) is clear and his actions align with it, but interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The capsize memory surfaces but functions more as atmospheric coloring than a live internal conflict shaping his choices in the present beat. Embodied emotion appears (chest heaving, frantic hands) but the peak moment—striking the rod, guiding heat—reads as competent problem-solving without genuine struggle or a mistake that compounds before resolution. The final satisfaction forecloses no visible path with felt cost; he succeeds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's motivation is specific and embodied: the lens "hummed in his hands" and spirits are "merely loud in their terror," driving his selfish desire for silence. His inadvertent stubbornness—"once he started a burial, he simply could not stop"—constrains choices and aligns with his three-day descent. Internal contradiction is present (selfish rest-seeking versus dutiful undertaker service), though emotional progression remains somewhat linear. The final choice to restore the beacon is earned by prior setup, but the moment lacks a visible cost that complicates the satisfaction of achieved quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—building intergenerational solidarity through anonymous aid—but her interior life remains abstract. The piece tells us she is "gently persistent" and "relentlessly focused" without embodying contradictory impulses in action. Kael appears briefly but exerts no pressure on Elara's choices; the runners are silent props. The final stance (standing guard) feels static rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and drives his presence on the bridge, but his interior life leans heavily on abstract spiritual concepts ("forensic need," "channeling unused love") rather than embodied contradiction. The spirit's thorns are a strong visual metaphor, yet her interiority remains inaccessible—she's a problem to be solved rather than a character under pressure. The final realization that "unused love was not stored in a vault; it was fuel" reads as an epiphany delivered to Silas rather than earned through struggle with competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (replacing the lens, matching breath) but feel procedural rather than emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to touch time is consistently rendered and embodied through his physical interaction with the bridge. The retrocognitive trap is described but its constraint on present choice remains largely abstract—the floating photographs block vision but don't force meaningful micro-trade-offs until the climax. Internal voice is consistent and vivid, though the final weeping feels slightly told rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The trauma backstory (hospital, funeral, nursery) primes the closure adequately but doesn't tilt present tactics through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is driven by clear motivation to protect the seed vault, with his decade of preparation and patient strategy earned through consistent action. His calm dignity at the end shows earned endurance. However, interiority remains thin—he never experiences contradictory impulses or internal friction during the high-pressure sequence, reading more as a function than a person wrestling with cost. The shackle that binds him is established but never constrains a choice or creates visible suffering that complicates his task.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's obsessive motivation is established clearly, and her method—harvesting silences from doomed ships—is character-specific. However, interiority defaults to abstract terminology ("psychic weight," "essence of abandonment") rather than embodied sensation. The synesthetic trait is decorative rather than constraining; no choice hinges on hearing colors, and the final beat delivers technical achievement without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are clearly rooted in her metaphysical hunger, and her interiority carries specific texture ("golden-hour portrait thief," "quietly savvy"). The moment of realization when the man looks at *her* delivers embodied shock ("wave of luminous disbelief"), but the final beat lacks a visible choice or cost—she sits frozen, watching. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece leans heavily on wonder without showing her wrestle with competing impulses or make a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is rendered through concrete, embodied action—rotating the blowpipe, sweeping ash, consulting the journal—and his spirited narration to dead machinery demonstrates contradictory impulses (isolation vs. performance, safety vs. risk). The decision to leave the control room is earned by accumulated pressure (glacier calving, tilting floor) and forecloses the sanctuary with visible cost (the dome left behind). Minor slip: the "thoughtfully spirited" balance is more asserted than dramatized through micro-choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's hyper-vigilance and phobia-driven terror are embodied through concrete physical responses (knees knocking, hands shaking violently) and his adaptation—using panic "as a high-frequency radar"—drives the climactic choice. The internal contradiction between multiple competing terrors and his decision to lock himself in darkness with his fears shows character complexity under pressure. Minor slip: the phrase "motivation to prove that vulnerability is power" reads slightly thematic rather than organically character-driven in that moment. The final act of inverting the sanctuary protocols is earned by his obsessive attention to detail established early.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—drawing a map of the void to guide lost souls—and her ritual actions embody her oracle nature through concrete micro-choices (trapping the gold flake, listening to silence gaps, marking the map). The "mildly obsessed" trait manifests on the page when she traps the flake and interprets the gilding's degradation. Internal contradiction is minimal; her resolve remains steady rather than layered with competing impulses, which limits depth but supports the tone. The final placement of the gold flake reads as earned closure, a renunciation of light for completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit 734's philosophical curiosity ("to find where thoughts come from") is established and shapes his approach to the task, but his decisions remain functionally custodial rather than transformative. The embodied moments—scanning energy transfer, watching absorption—show character-specific perception, yet the final choice (dropping the violin into the recycler) lacks meaningful internal conflict or cost. The interiority leans heavily on programmatic language ("logic gates," "archived the night's data") that reads more like charming metaphor than genuine contradiction under pressure. A renunciation or trade-off with visible stakes would elevate this from observation to agency.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" drives the on-page action and the collection serves as both secret and confession. His micro-choices—extending his hand, selecting specific tickets, projecting unshielded thought—reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. However, his internal contradiction is under-embodied; we're told he's a romantic in a utilitarian age but don't feel competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Mara's shift from suspicion to understanding lands cleanly, though her interiority remains thinner than required for dual-character work at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is concrete and his actions embody the central stake without therapy-speak. The sub-prefect remains functional but somewhat flat, serving primarily as foil. Elian's pragmatism shows in embodied choices (kneeling, polishing, building the cairn) that avoid moralizing. The backstory of fraudulent marbles integrates cleanly via present action, grounding his penance without derailing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's internal contradiction—obliging mechanic masking radical obsession—is embodied through concrete choices (jury-rigged array, salvaged capacitors) and the closing decision to withhold his discovery while performing compliance. His motivation to prove sideways time is grounded in observed geometry and drives the central action. The impulse to "step sideways with them" and the final return to the wrench show contradictory pulls acting simultaneously. Minor slip: the phrase "optional at this length" from the rubric signals some relationship depth is absent, but the solo POV justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by obsession to decode the Maestro's message, with clear physical embodiment (trembling hands, bated breath). Internal contradiction is visible when he "did not intend to destroy it, but to translate it," showing competing impulses. The "lately inspired" sensation remains largely label-only, introduced early but not dramatized as a constraint that shapes choice under pressure. The final gesture—raising the baton in acknowledgment—reads as symbolic rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation—finding and managing the suppressed truth—is concrete and drives his choice to create the smudge. His embodied fever recovery and trembling hand provide physical specificity. However, the interiority leans heavily on elevated register ("bio-digital chimera," "fault-tolerant oracle") that reads more like conceptual labeling than lived thought under pressure. The final choice to distribute the truth into noise shows agency with cost, but the emotional contradiction feels muted—more explained than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is well-anchored in the guilt from his own job-site accident, creating a clear parallel with the factory disaster. His drowsy alertness and skeptical-yet-superstitious use of the radio show embodied contradiction. The closing realization—"he wasn't the only one who had chosen comfort over safety"—functions as Earned Stasis but edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. Internal voice is consistent and character-specific, though the final beat leans slightly into articulated insight rather than felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is established through embodied detail—arthritis vanishing, "clouded eyes tracing the lines"—and her motivation to witness without judgment shapes the arc. However, the character remains observational throughout; her agency at closure is passive acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The final stance ("keeper of the quiet") feels like a label rather than an earned renunciation with dramatized consequence. Internal contradiction is minimal; she glides toward stasis without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is legible—his "cautious exuberance" and motivation to nurture wonder read consistently through micro-choices (wrapping the curl, timing the melody). Elara's transformation feels earned by the confluence of stimuli rather than by her own agency, which is appropriate given her dementia but leaves the emotional arc lopsided. The "therapist placing object in patient's palm" beat risks flatness; the embodied detail ("trembling palm," tears tracking lines) lifts it, but the phrase "Feel the softness, Elara... Remember the weight of him" edges toward therapy-speak at a pivotal moment (−0.3). No contradiction in traits or knowledge states; the cost (Elara's return to confusion implied by "the session was over") is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and specific—collecting psychic impressions from structures—but his interior life remains largely observational rather than contradictory. The astronomer's descent into madness is told through diary fragments rather than dramatized, and Elian's own choices feel like excavation rather than decisions under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; his "cold spike of panic" and the structure's "relaxation" read more as atmospheric description than character-specific contradiction. The final packing and descent lack visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arthur's interiority is character-particular (microdot specs, the scarred desk ritual), and the shift from passive relay to active orchestrator is causally grounded in his accidental prophecy problem. The motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is tagged with elevated diction that feels slightly imposed rather than emerging from stress. Internal contradiction appears (paranoia versus resolution) but the prophetic examples lean toward told backstory rather than embodied present tension. The final smile and peace after the erratic lighthouse display suggest a clear endpoint, though the renunciation cost feels more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kellen's motivation (to illuminate hidden assumptions) is clear and dramatized through his loop-pedal exorcism, and the stakes intensify when he sees the Vantablack rippling. The embodied details—tangled cables, stomping the pedal—ground his actions. However, Elias remains passive throughout, a vessel rather than a participant, reducing the relationship crucible to near-zero. The final tears feel slightly conventional given the intensity of the preceding supernatural assault.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is consistently rendered through concrete physical actions (pressing forehead to glass, adjusting coat, withdrawing the shell), and the "chronologically homesick" trait shapes his methodology on the page. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between exhaustion and obsessive completion, embodied in "fighting the heaviness in his eyelids." The climactic moment of transcendence reads earned by prior buildup, though the shift from ache to "harmonious absolute" resolves smoothly without the messier irrationality typical of peak emotional states. The embodied details (sound felt "in his teeth and his bones") ground what could be abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority shows embodied contradiction—she simultaneously hovers and feels the "crushing burden of being real"—and her final choice to accept gravity is motivated by the tablet's sequence. However, the protagonist's internal experience leans toward abstract states ("fragmented identities," "singularity of her being") rather than moment-to-moment bodily particulars under stress. The decision to land reads as thematically necessary but lacks micro-hesitations or contradictory impulses in the final beat that would show genuine struggle. The change forecloses floating with visible cost, meeting baseline expectations but not exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation to break emotional numbness is clearly established and his actions follow through with embodied detail (trembling hand, gasps, tears). The ritual provides a concrete framework for his arc. However, the final turn—"ready to teach again"—feels abrupt; the journey from dam-breaking grief to restored purpose compresses too quickly without showing the intermediate stance shift. The interiority leans toward abstract metaphor ("filament of hush," "tangible presence of peace") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as storm recorder is established early and her micro-choices under pressure—climbing laterally, pocketing the tube—are concretely embodied. Internal contradiction is present (scientific curiosity vs. survival caution) but remains somewhat schematic; the final stance of "strange detachment" arrives without sufficient on-page earned cost to feel inevitable. Embodied emotion ("fingers finding a solid grip," "pressed herself flat") works well in the physical beats, but interiority occasionally drifts toward declaration ("feeling a strange detachment") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is characterized through embodied action—kneeling, scraping, whispering—and his motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives concrete choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when his "ethically playful demeanor" collides with "somber, crushing realization," and the final choice to pull away from the wall feels earned by the rope's smoking strain. The interiority occasionally drifts into elevated register ("passionate subtlety," "granular, rushing fabric") that reads more authorial than character-particular, but the climactic renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's acoustically perceptive trait is embodied through her awareness of settling steel and tidal sighs, and her motivation to "honor the jagged edges" is clear. The piece successfully renders her stance—not to fix but to find beauty—through concrete micro-choices: kneeling to strike flint, transferring flame, using the dome's resonance. Internal contradictions are light; the community's collective response works as embodied emotion. The protagonist's final choice to leave the melody unresolved is earned, foreclosing easy consolation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is given clear motivation (fusing insight with empathy) and professional thoroughness, but his interiority remains thin—his emotions are embodied through static-electricity sensing rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Elara's desperation is visceral and her surrender is shown, but she exists primarily as a vessel for the transaction rather than a character with her own competing wants. The transformation at the end is reported through observation ("tension begin to drain") rather than dramatized through her micro-choices under pressure. "Professionally thorough in every aspect of his obscure trade" and "affectionate detachment" read as diagnostic labels rather than traits that constrain choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to deliver the letter is clearly rooted in his past (stranger funded his venture) and drives his present action, though the interiority leans explanatory rather than contradictory under pressure. His "whimsically attentive" trait is demonstrated through concrete observation (rust patterns, nervous twitches) but remains more label than lived constraint. The librarian's reaction to the locket is embodied and genuine, though she remains largely reactive. The final choice to stay and talk feels earned but carries minimal visible cost—more an opening than a foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to join the community is clear and sustained, and her sympathetic response to the injured boy creates a credible turning point. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract emotional labels—"luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final grafting feels more asserted than earned through visible internal struggle; we see the gesture but not the cost of what she surrenders or risks in wrapping her fragile art around their permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and her final choice—trading a week of her life for the sketch—carries visible physical cost (wrinkled hands, white hair). The pendant's attribute is embodied through repeated handling and its burning against her chest. Interiority remains specific to an illustrator's observational urgency, though the "esoteric motivation" phrasing momentarily drifts toward telling. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; the physical aging at closure earns the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent—grief-driven mathematical inquiry into his daughter's disappearance. Interiority leans heavily on reflective exposition ("Logic dictated that if grief had a weight...") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The final shift to "buried optimism" is asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure; we're told he feels conviction, not shown the contradictory impulses that would make renunciation costly. Backstory dominates without enough present-scene friction to anchor the change.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation—becoming visible as providence—is established early and drives his caching choice. The sense memory trigger (tape → cigarette smoke, damp wool) is vividly embodied but briefly deployed; the librarian's yearning is told ("wept over in frustration") rather than dramatized in her prior choices. The final moment lands his isolation dissolving "into the light," yet this shift reads more asserted than paid for by visible renunciation or struggle on the page. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece relies on stated desire more than competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation is embodied through specific physical detail (bark-like patches, bruised olive fingers) and his characteristic evasion shows clearly in the high-minded scientist language masking panic. The arc from control to surrender is earned through escalating physical pain when he resists. Minor slip: the "circuitously sincere" voice wavers slightly in the greenhouse section where interiority becomes more direct, though it recovers at closure. The final choice to release the leaf and lean into the trellis carries visible cost—abandoning his research identity—and forecloses the reconstruction path.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through exhaustion ("eyes that felt packed with grit and salt"), his obsessive need to distill ruin into art drives the exchange, and the final renunciation (trading the filter for the brooch) forecloses survival for symbolism with visible cost. The scavenger is sketched efficiently ("skin mapped by radiation burns") and applies immediate pressure. Interiority remains concrete and particular; the insomnia reframed as "necessary vigil" at closure earns the shift without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's arc from macro-focused seer to someone who notices "microscopic miracles" is legible but arrives through exposition rather than dramatized contradiction. The pearl-handling moment offers one concrete micro-choice (reaching out, then withdrawing), yet her interior voice leans heavily on abstract philosophical register ("concentration of the ambient wonder") that feels more like authorial thesis than character-particular perception under stress. Kael remains functional but thin—his weeping feels asserted rather than earned by prior embodied struggle. The ending renunciation (withdrawing her hand) carries conceptual cost but minimal visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and embodied—"fingers curling around the cold brass," "eyes fixed on the crowd, adjusting the timing." His motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" drives the action clearly, and the final satisfaction shows change. The reactively visionary trait is demonstrated, not labeled, through his recognition of the void and immediate response. Minor issue: the trait feels slightly expository ("a trait that marked him as reactively visionary") rather than fully dramatized, but it doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's obsession with unseen patterns is clear and her final choice to shatter the jar is motivated by established character, but her journey feels more like following a predetermined path than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The self-knowledge epiphany ("defense mechanism against the chaos of human intimacy") arrives fully articulated without prior dramatized resistance or cost. Internal conflict is stated rather than shown in competing impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The embodied fear at the chasm ("heart hammered against her ribs, a rhythm of panic that warred with her resolve") briefly touches contradiction but resolves too cleanly into "trembling certainty" without visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's skepticism and scientific frame are established early and her motivation shifts credibly mid-story from cataloging to preservation. However, the interior remains somewhat thin: the "entangled memories" arrive as sensation rather than through embodied contradiction, and her decision to risk academic standing feels asserted more than earned through on-page struggle. The "sympathetic skeptic" label does constrain her approach (reverence despite doubt), but the peak choice lacks visible internal cost or trade-off that would elevate the characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation—"a desperate, clawing need to discover what happens after goodbye"—is clear and intensifies toward the ritual. Interiority carries conceptual weight ("bored immortal," "eroded by...memories") but leans toward abstraction; embodied contradictions are present in his welcoming of hostility yet remain largely told. The final renunciation (stepping into dissolution) is earned by prior setup, though the arc privileges philosophical stance over micro-choices under pressure. Internal voice is consistent but elevated throughout, lacking friction or degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian's motivation is clear and his "radical candor" trait drives the scene, though his interior remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "find the mathematics of a fair trade" function more as thematic labels than embodied stakes. The ink-pot gambit reflects his values, but we see little internal conflict or cost to him personally; he remains controlled throughout without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Vance's transformation reads mechanically: the ink triggers instant empathy without the messy middle of resistance, flattening what could have been a richer reversal. Elena is present but passive, a case number both before and after, which undercuts relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's goal—fabricating tactile histories—is clear and drives her specialized preparation, but the character remains largely a vessel for craft exposition. Her "incandescent restraint" and "burning curiosity" are told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in action. The final moment of tactile verification ("cold, sharp echo") provides embodied sensation, but the lack of genuine internal conflict or cost-bearing choice caps the category. No other character appears on the page; apply only single-POV bullets.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's unusual perceptual filter and archival motivation are established early and consistently shape their actions. The act of layering found audio over physical debris demonstrates embodied ritual with micro-choices visible on the page. However, the character remains more a vehicle for the concept than a fully contradictory consciousness—internal friction is minimal, and the poison-label reconstruction proceeds without resistance or cost to the narrator's existing framework. The final placement feels ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "gloomy cheerfulness" embodies contradiction effectively. The arc from skeptic to myth-participant is legible, though the peak choice—shouting corrections to his life—feels more performed than internally wrestled. The mentor and ex-wife voices ("loved his brokenness") land with embodied cost, but the final grin and "manic" label edge toward diagnostic convenience rather than lived contradiction in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—dual allegiance and fierce need to protect the community—and her professional expertise ("orderly intuitive fashion") shapes the plan. However, her interior life remains largely functional; we see her competence but little embodied contradiction or emotional friction beyond "frantic beat of her own heart." The final diplomatic smile hints at duality but arrives without visible internal cost or renunciation that would earn the closure choice. Relationships and secondary characters (tugboat captains, families) exist off-page or as atmospheric pressure rather than crucibles that test her allegiance in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and particularized—purposefully curious, a trait that earns him excellent inspection work but poor conformity—and his actions show embodied detail (the sand grain pressed against his fingertip for focus, the cold gnawing through his suit). Internal contradiction emerges when his professional role conflicts with unauthorized behavior, and the talisman gesture ties his values to physical sensation. The final choice—capturing the image and feeling the grain one last time—feels earned, though the cost (merely completing an unauthorized photograph) remains somewhat abstract rather than foreclosing a concrete path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his mastery is established early, but his competence is so flawless that struggle never materializes—he moves through the repair "with the stillness of a statue," adjusts servos smoothly, and completes the task without a single misstep or visible tradeoff. The courier provides external pressure but no interpersonal friction; Elias remains emotionally flat throughout, never doubting or compromising. His blindness is labeled as a constraint ("Though he oversaw the repair shop while blind") but functions only as texture; no on-page choice is complicated by it. The ending smile and quiet satisfaction feel told rather than earned through dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas exhibits a consistent, dry-witted voice and his quest is rooted in concrete, if eccentric, motivation. His internal certainty—"the quiet assurance of a man who knows he is the only one in the room who has done the reading"—is embodied through gesture (checking watch, uncapping pen) and aligns with his professional persona. The final choice to withhold coordinates is earned by his stated contempt for commercialization, and the decision forecloses publication with visible, if understated, cost. Minor issue: the falcon's return is received with formulaic acknowledgment ("as one might acknowledge a punctual train") rather than a micro-choice that reveals internal contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear—restore shared balance through orchestrating footfall rhythms—but his interiority remains thin; we see his method and patience but little internal contradiction or embodied cost. The baker and miners respond to his tempo without resistance, flattening potential conflict. The final retreat feels more like a posed tableau than a choice that forecloses a path; his "infinitely patient" stance never faces a meaningful test that would earn the endurance as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied: "lungs burned with the stale, recycled air," "black edges of hypoxia began to creep." The choice to stay and complete transmission is well-motivated by her role and values, and the final renunciation—accepting death to preserve the message—is earned through prior pressure. Internal conflict between survival instinct and mission is dramatized through physical struggle ("Every biological impulse screamed at her to abandon") rather than merely told. Minor: the psychic artifact's effects could be more specifically grounded in her personal experience rather than generic flashes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's interior life is portrayed through symbolic actions (turning driftwood, peering through lattice) rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "chase hush" and "thread a labyrinth with your own story" reads as abstract label-speak rather than grounded desire tested by pressure. The final disappearance feels externally imposed by the prison's physics rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. No visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path; he simply exploits a convenient metaphysical loophole.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking a cure by honoring an ancestral debt—but his interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The ghost bride's motivation is told rather than shown through dramatized choice; she appears, performs the transaction, and leaves without internal friction. The final "mournful elation" is asserted as a label rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in the moment. Micro-choices exist (raising the bead, collapsing onto the bench) but lack visible cost or trade-off that would foreclose a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her skill grounded in concrete action—she physically sews stone with kelp-and-steel thread while in a trance state. However, interiority remains largely externalized through poetic description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The trance mechanic distances us from genuine internal conflict: her "hauntingly optimistic" smile and "fearlessness that consciousness could not provide" tell rather than dramatize the psychological cost of her choice. The final collapse registers as physical exhaustion rather than a renunciation or alteration with felt emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in diaspora displacement, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("desperate need to bridge the aching gap") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The embodied emotion is thin—"warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"—reads as labels rather than visceral states. The final choice (hoisting the gnomon) feels thematically coherent but arrives without visible internal conflict or a foregrounded cost that would elevate the moment. Minor issue: "wondering if the skull...belonged to a poet, a mother, or a potter" tells rather than enacts curiosity through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and concrete—creating pseudonyms for the disconnected—but his interiority remains largely expository rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The character exists primarily to demonstrate the world's logic and thematic apparatus; his choices feel more like steps in an argument than genuine struggle. The "carefully inventive" trait is mentioned but not tested under pressure: we see him craft a single pseudonym with no visible cost, friction, or error that forces adaptation. The final act of mailing the letter is procedural, not a choice that forecloses a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's dual performance—trembling senility versus sharp agency—is embodied through concrete choices (fumbling the spool, straightening after Kael leaves). Her motivation to "listen for unheard stories" drives the needle work with visible cost (the risk of encoding treason). Kael remains functional but one-note; his sneering impatience serves pressure without interior contradiction. The shift from mask to truth is clean, though the final slump back into senility feels more asserted than earned by on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian's motivation to revisit the moment of departure is clear and his embodied shame ("burning his throat") reads concrete. However, his agency is largely passive—he watches Elara perform while the stone heals itself. The final choice to write the letter feels asserted rather than wrestled with on the page; we don't see him weighing competing impulses or paying a visible cost in the moment of deciding.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is embodied through micro-actions (seeking coral, tracing cast) and internal contradictions (translator who can't translate his own trauma). His motivation to rewrite the cast emerges from concrete tactile engagement rather than summary. The therapeutic vocabulary ("lotus-hearted ache," "unknot") occasionally edges toward label-speak but remains tethered to physical action. His final breathing in sync with the tide earns the renunciation of analytical distance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her desire to rediscover joy drives the daydream sequence, but the arc lacks contradiction or genuine internal conflict—she moves smoothly from frustrated to amused without encountering friction that tests her choice. The "pensive mirth" reaction feels observational rather than earned through struggle; the piece tells us she's reclaiming something but never dramatizes a moment where she risks losing it again. Embodied emotion is present (chest knot loosens, breathless laughter) but the progression from anxiety to satisfaction is too linear. The final "ghost of a smile" suggests change, but the cost of the journey—what she forfeited or faced—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's yearning to "exchange certainty for curiosity" is established early and drives the coin-toss choice, but the nested dream sequence offers no micro-choices or contradictory impulses—each awakening simply happens to him. The final smile and reply show a shift in stance, but the transformation occurs off-stage during the ping-induced fugue rather than through on-page struggle. Internal voice is vivid ("the heavy coat of knowing dissolved") yet the passive receipt of visions and the lack of embodied cost during the awakenings keep agency at arm's length. Embodied emotion is present in the opening and close but flattens during the dream layers.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian's motivation is established early and his choices drive action, but his interior remains largely performative rather than contradictory—he quips under pressure without visible cost to composure. The final walk through distortion reads more as thematic gesture than earned transformation grounded in prior struggle. Dr. Aris functions primarily as a device to deliver exposition and panic rather than applying relational pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; Julian "adjusted his spectacles" but never sweats, trembles, or second-guesses in ways that would reveal genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is rendered through concrete actions—releasing sound, cultivating growth—rather than mere declaration. His internal contradiction (cursed with wakefulness yet performing a life's work of creation) drives the scene forward. The final choice to ensconce the postcard feels earned by centuries of carrying it, though the emotional cost could be more viscerally embodied in the moment of release. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("biological alchemy," "toxic isotope") that reads more poetic than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is present and the motivation to preserve names is clear, but interior contradiction is minimal—he moves through his ritual without genuine competing impulses acting simultaneously. Emotions are somewhat embodied ("pang of foxglove regret," "chest tightening"), though the phrase "foxglove regret" edges toward label-speak. The final choice to repair the chime feels mechanical rather than a renunciation or transformation with visible cost that forecloses a path. Backstory fragments (predecessor's lullaby, Age of Noise) anchor in present action adequately but the story leans heavily on reflection without micro-choices altering present options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her magical manipulation, with concrete choices under pressure. The "carefully reckless precision" is shown rather than told through her physical engagement with dangerous magic. Internal contradiction appears in her desperation versus control, though the interior could be more character-particular—some phrasing trends generic ("cautious exuberance that dared to hope"). Kael's shift from departure to engagement is clean, though his interiority receives less development.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in compassion versus rationing laws, with embodied tension during the chain-rigging sequence ("hands began to tremble…from the overwhelming adrenaline"). Internal conflict reads somewhat abstract—"dappled resolve" is descriptive rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice is earned by prior setup, but the protagonist's competence overshadows genuine struggle; his ingenious plan executes without meaningful error or adaptation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to preserve Martian songs is clear and drives his final choice, with internal contradiction present in his hoarding of silence versus his need to share the secret. The woman's exhaustion stops his habitual lying, creating an earned micro-turn. However, her character remains underdeveloped—she arrives with receipts but her own stake and desire are never dramatized, reducing the relational crucible. The final choice to release Aero feels motivated but the woman's presence doesn't sufficiently pressure it; Elian could have made this decision alone.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her understanding of boundaries drives the arc from investigation to revelation to action. Internal logic is consistent: the maze architect's daughter seeking to reimpose distance. However, her choices feel more intellectual than embodied—she observes, intuits, and concludes without visceral struggle or contradiction. The final retreat is conceptually earned but lacks visible cost or friction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "learn the rhythm of belonging" feels abstractly declared rather than concretely embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The burnt feather gesture at the end carries symbolic weight but the release feels more thematic completion than earned renunciation with visible cost—her internal contradictions (climbing higher made it colder) are told in reflection rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Kael remains functional but one-note, existing primarily to facilitate Elara's arc rather than applying independent pressure. The final choice to leave the feather lacks the felt foreclosure of a path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and singular, and her chirpy delight at "exquisite despair" establishes a distinctive trait. Her conjecture action ("It wasn't fear that hid the path... It was hope") is a micro-choice under pressure, and the ending reveals a change—she now knows the civilization became "background noise." However, the progression from curiosity to "giddy melancholy" feels gestural rather than earned; the stakes remain observational, and the cost of her discovery is implied sentiment ("delighted to know") rather than a visible trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through his analytical obsession and motivation to "serenade monotony with creativity," but he remains a concept more than a contradictory consciousness. The woman exists solely as the target of his manipulation—no interiority, no choice of her own—reducing her to a plot device. The piece asserts Elias's "disassembled pocket watch" mind and "desperate, burning need" but never dramatizes internal conflict or a cost to his performance; he engineers, watches, and leaves satisfied, foreclosing no path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation to inscribe the forbidden verse is declared early and drives the ritual, but her internal contradiction remains thin—we see elegant composure maintained throughout without genuine struggle between fear and defiance acting simultaneously in scene. The "slow, dry suffocation" is told rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final departure reads as inevitable from the opening, with no visible cost that forecloses an alternative she actively considered on the page. Embodied emotion is present in the pain of inscription but the stakes feel more thematic than personally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and embodied in his craft, and the interior world feels specific to his lens as a glazier who "reads between lines." The final choice—to stand and accept the atrium's value—is earned by the ripple-reading ritual, though the transition from anxiety to certainty is smooth rather than conflicted. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("alchemy of observation," "essential facets required to scatter the light") that reads more like authorial summary than a craftsman's direct perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is grounded in embodied detail (calloused fingers, scars as topography) and his motive to translate pain is clear. The bargain with the inferno—trading hope for endurance—is told rather than tested on the page; we see no contradictory impulse or micro-choice that dramatizes internal conflict. The final act of scattering soot feels predetermined rather than earned through visible struggle, so the change reads more as stated relief than forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation and internal logic are clear—he applies calculus to visions and encodes hope geometrically—but his interiority remains declarative and explanatory rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The piece tells us he is a "logical dreamer" rather than dramatizing competing impulses in action. The final "stop calculating and simply breathe" moment gestures at earned change, but the cost is asserted rather than felt through prior struggle or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias demonstrates concrete interior complexity—his professional detachedness masks esoteric motivation, embodied through trembling hands and chest-tightening. The trait "sensitively perceptive, cursed with empathy that extended to inanimate stone" functions mostly as label; it's told rather than shown constraining a choice under pressure. The final decision to carry the memories out is motivated by accumulated knowledge, but the emotional arc from detachment to burden-bearer could be more contradictory and embodied in the peak moment. No significant micro-choices with visible trade-offs appear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her magic system creates concrete choices, but her interiority remains thin—she's more archetype than individual. The man in the chair is entirely passive, a prop for her work rather than a character with agency. The "perceptively calm" attribute appears as a label without embodied contradiction or cost. Elara's alteration of the reflection demonstrates competence but lacks genuine struggle or foreclosed options that would earn higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's "operatively gentle" demeanor is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The warlords' grief over Elara and Jory lands with embodied cost, but their shift from sneering to signing feels compressed—decades of hardness melt in a single ritual beat without visible internal struggle. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("drawing fresh water from a stone," "keeper of the list") rather than character-particular thought. The final choice is causally set up but the protagonists' agency feels guided by Kaelen's script rather than emerging from contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vance's core contradiction—destroy to profit, preserve to mourn—drives the piece, but interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("secretly sentimental," "architecture of his soul," "paradox") rather than embodied contradiction in micro-choices. The egg placement is motivated, yet the final gesture reads more as symbolic tableau than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Phrases like "amoral philanthropist in the truest sense" and "paranoid ferocity" tell rather than show through action under pressure. No sustained internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; contradictions are declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (defiance through withholding) is stated but never tested on the page—she moves through the courtyard unopposed, her "chaste courtesan" status functioning as flavor rather than a live constraint that forces a choice. Internal conflict is absent; she executes her plan without hesitation, contradiction, or visible cost to her identity. The Magistrate's shift from stupor to realization arrives too late to pressure her decision, and no embodied emotion complicates the unlocking act. The piece tells us she is "sharp, unbreakable" but never dramatizes a moment where that sharpness might break.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his calligrapher background informs his precise control, but his internal experience remains largely external performance. The "uncommonly serene" trait is asserted repeatedly without embodied contradiction or cost that complicates his choices. The heckler's transformation from shouting to "slumped and mute" happens off-page without dramatized struggle, weakening the relational pressure that should force Silas's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and shapes his action, but interiority remains largely abstract—"vibrating threads," "spiritual void"—rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to include the moth wing is purposeful but not charged by internal conflict; he operates as a conduit executing a ritual rather than a character wrestling with competing impulses. The final turn away reads as renunciation but lacks visible cost tied to a prior dilemma. No secondary character pressure to test him.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interior motivation is concrete and embodied—his "snowmelt ardor" and the tactile engagement with the punched card ground his emotional arc in physical action. The renunciation (burning the paper to achieve permanence) is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "snowmelt ardor" itself borders on label-speak, though the subsequent embodiment recovers immediacy. The grief-to-monument transformation shows internal contradiction (destroying to preserve) acted out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's temporal blindness is vivid and character-specific, driving the trance choice and the final lever-pull. Her motivation to understand the bunker's selection of her reads slightly abstract but generates a coherent stance. The final act—trusting her hands in the unseeable present—feels earned by the constraint, though the articulation "transcend the limitation" edges toward label-speak. Internal contradiction is present (seeking safety versus embracing chaos) but could be sharpened in micro-choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bel-ibni is well-drawn through his parsimony (extinguishing torches, saving chalk for three years) and the central contradiction between his skepticism and empirical discovery of the divine is embodied in action. The forty-year arc of debunking myths only to find proof of sentience gives weight to his final ritual. Internal conflict operates concretely: he hides reverence inside dry charts, practices "encrypted devotion," and allows himself only "a single, brief nod" of satisfaction. Minor weakness: the astronomer's emotional register remains so tightly controlled that some peak beats (the rift opening, the covenant sealing) lack embodied contradiction or visible cost in his physical reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elian's scheming pacifist contradiction is declared but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; his motivations remain abstract labels ("dangerous contradictions," "orchestrating complex deceptions") rather than embodied internal conflict. The cellular memory transfer replaces any struggle with a mechanism that rewrites Kaelen externally, eliminating genuine character work at the closure beat. Kaelen receives forced "cellular memory" rather than earning his shift through choices, and the final relief is asserted ("genuine relief") without visible cost or foreclosed options. Diagnostic label-speak pervades peak moments: "shifting grace," "vertiginous void," "entry point for something greater."

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is specific and embodied through concrete action (planting boots, holding breath until burning), and the synchronized breathing demonstrates internal stakes made physical. However, the character remains largely reactive to the ritual's mechanics rather than facing contradictory impulses; the dream-capture proceeds without meaningful internal conflict or self-doubt that would reveal character under pressure. The final "touch the air" moment reads as observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is clear but not tested by competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's feisty competence and stubborn persistence read consistently through choices—arguing with magic, refusing to retreat, upending her bag in desperation. Her motivation to "bridge generational wisdom" arrives as told reflection rather than emerging from prior beats, weakening the causal chain slightly. The quartz-eye detail and "raised three toddlers" line provide embodied particularity, and her recognition of the deciduous principle feels earned by the ribbon's memory rather than convenient epiphany. Internal contradiction is present (stubbornness vs. the need to let go) but could act more simultaneously in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's interiority is embodied through physical detail (teeth ache, trembling fingers) and his bathroom ritual grounds his thought process in character-specific habit. The contradiction between curator role and cosmic punchline victim operates throughout, and the final choice to "carve the fear" represents genuine internal conflict resolved through action. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward articulated epiphany rather than fully dramatized struggle at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives her forward, but her interior life remains thin—most of her choices feel procedurally determined rather than internally conflicted. The Traveler's arc is told rather than enacted; we see his exhaustion but not the micro-choices that might complicate Elara's extraction. The botanical-diary insight feels intellectually clever but emotionally inert, a puzzle-solution rather than a values-driven gamble with visible personal cost. The golem negotiation lacks embodied tension or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear—she seeks her absorbed twin sister in the Garden of Forgotten Names. The final realization that "recapture of the past was unnecessary because the past was living actively within her cells" marks a credible shift from extraction to acceptance, but the transition feels slightly abrupt; the embodied struggle between wanting separation and accepting unity could be more viscerally dramatized in the garden itself. Interiority leans abstract in places ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant") where concrete sensation would sharpen the contradiction. The phantom heartbeat motif and the swatch card anchor her tactile world, preventing full drift into metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his "warmly methodical" approach is demonstrated through action. However, the archivist remains competent throughout without meaningful internal contradiction or struggle—he never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible personal cost. The task is framed as difficult but his execution is flawless, reducing the sense of genuine constraint. Embodied emotion is minimal; we see craft but not inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (pressing hands to ears, dragging boots, kneeling). Her mapkeeper expertise drives concrete choices under pressure, and the final slump shows cost. Internal contradiction is present but mild—her desperation versus methodical analysis could push harder against each other in the peak beat. The embodied emotion ("teeth ache," "trembling fingers") grounds her throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her retrocognitive gift is shown through concrete sensory detail ("felt the sweat of the engineers"). Her obsessive drive to prove coincidences have meaning propels the action, and the final choice to activate the beacon flows from established traits. However, the character remains somewhat archetypal—the solitary keeper restoring a broken beacon—and her internal contradictions or blind spots are thin; she faces physical struggle but little genuine doubt or competing impulse that would deepen the cost of her success.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is vivid and particular ("preemptively nostalgic for the very moment she was currently inhabiting"), but her choices remain observational rather than dramatically conflicted. The archivist role is embodied through the thermal stylus and shadow measurement, yet no contradictory impulse acts in scene—she moves from observation to writing without a visible internal fork. The final "loving it fiercely" moment feels asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose a path. Agency reads as documentation rather than decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is vivid with embodied detail (boot scraping, feeling dew density) and his action of creating fireworks flows from consistent traits. However, the character arc lacks contradiction—he arrives capable and playful, executes perfectly, and departs unchanged with no internal friction or foreclosed path. The refugees function as an emotional backdrop rather than applying interpersonal pressure. The motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" remains abstract and uncontested, never forcing a choice that reveals a hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior is specific and embodied through the jade cicada, tangential observation method, and micro-choices (watching the starfish, stroking the jade, choosing how to interpret the texture of time). Her final release of Kael is earned by the extended silent processing and shows visible cost—accepting solitude mapped through future mornings cataloguing alone. The warmly observant trait constrains her response method throughout. Minor: Kael remains a silhouette; his defiance/guilt is told rather than shown in gesture or failed speech.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's claustrophobic origins drive her skyward refuge in a credible contradiction, and the interiority is concrete ("ghost physically holding her hand," "stretching contracted muscle"). The bunker-to-stratosphere arc structures her journey, though the final choice—capping the doll to "let the silence sprout again"—arrives with described intent rather than felt ambivalence. Backstory is purposefully anchored and tilts present stance. The micro-choice of sealing the doll forecloses risk, but the stakes of that cost remain more told than dramatized in peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and distinctive—teaching silence to comfort—and his actions align with that goal. The interiority relies heavily on explanatory abstractions ("psychic noise that could derail the gondola") rather than embodied perception under pressure. Kael's arc from panic to peace is visible but thin; her interior state is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice feels more mechanical than earned through genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's occupation as Lore Keeper is stated but never constrains a choice; her "wisely adventurous" nature is asserted, not embodied through contradictory impulses. The climb and throne-claiming sequence reads as competent execution without visible struggle or trade-off—no stamina cost, no fear response, no moment where caution wars with ambition. The final shift from observer to ruler is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"white-knuckled," "stiff and aching"—and her renunciation is earned through prior causality (dismantling the house, severing contacts). The final choice to drop the ring carries visible cost: she trades anchoring proof for terrifying open space. Elian's motivation ("to teach suffocating to breathe") is present but delivered via exposition rather than dramatized struggle; he functions more as catalyst than agent under pressure. The piece avoids therapy-speak in peak beats and grounds emotion in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by a clear desire rooted in his pyramid-scheme past, and his choice to "volunteer" as the focal point shows agency under pressure. However, his interior life leans heavily on exposition about coping mechanisms and bad deals rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act of channeling force into the bolt is embodied and specific, but the climactic moment lacks the visceral struggle that would elevate the choice into genuine internal conflict—he grits out one line and the resolution snaps cleanly without visible waver or cost to his body or psyche beyond "knees buckle."

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent—his choice to turn the crank is earned through setup of his forbidden-knowledge pursuit. Interiority feels specific ("let his breathing sync with the settling dust," "trusted the hum in his bones more than his fatigue"), and his reliance on intuition over logic creates genuine internal pressure. The ending choice (letting the recording play) carries visible cost as the silence breaks and the lie is exposed. Minor weakness: the piece tells us he is "eloquently silent" rather than letting that silence emerge fully through action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    Valerius is established as withdrawn and his motivation (capture possibility) is singular, but interiority remains largely abstract—"consuming," "raspy from years of disuse"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final pledge and ascent feel declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; the cost (forsaking past vows) is told, not dramatized through a visible forfeiture that alters present options. The armor losing weight and blood turning to light read as metaphorical summary rather than a credible psychophysical change rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is well-drawn through his habitual desperation and the specific skill of reading dust, avoiding therapy-speak even under pressure. His choice to add the addendum is motivated by twenty years of witnessing neglect, and the micro-choice to preserve the dust shows a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present—reverence for records versus the impulse to editorialize—but the final action (writing the addendum) feels slightly inevitable rather than conflicted in the moment, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's primary motivation—to restore historical truth—is clear and drives her choices throughout. Her resourcefulness is embodied in concrete actions (reading puddle reflections, wading through toxic water), though the internal contradiction between fear and determination could be sharper in peak moments. The final triumph feels somewhat declarative ("shivering but triumphant") rather than earned through a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward stock physical markers (trembling fingers, misting breath) without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear, singular motivation—silence the prophecy—but his interior life remains largely functional rather than contradictory. The "eerie nostalgia" is asserted as mood rather than embodied through conflicting micro-choices. His technique and exertion are shown concretely (burning lungs, shaking hands), yet the emotional cost reads as physical exhaustion rather than a hierarchy of values under genuine pressure. The final walk-away forecloses no visible path with felt weight; it's completion, not renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is characterized through precise occupational detail (seed sorter, monument builder) and his actions are coherent throughout. However, his interiority remains largely surface-level—we see him wait, watch, interpret, and build, but no contradictory impulses emerge under pressure. The motivational through-line (decode message → build monument → prod seed) reads mechanically functional rather than psychologically urgent. No meaningful internal cost or foreclosed path appears; the ritual succeeds without complication, leaving the character arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interior journey from control-seeking to embracing uncertainty is legible, and the final moment ("ready to calculate his next move based not on fear, but on the thrill of the unknown") shows a turn. However, the epiphany feels summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. The transition from broken plans to exhilaration arrives quickly without sufficient friction; we see panic ("screaming silently"), then immediate triumph, then instant realization, flattening the cost of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and distinctively rendered through her disciplined alchemist worldview—names as gravitational force, kintsugi intentions—but her interior remains somewhat cerebral and distant. The character sustains a coherent stance and the final touch of the cooling metal embodies her acceptance with felt cost. Internal contradiction is present in her choice to solidify rather than resurrect, though the piece leans heavily on conceptual framing rather than moment-to-moment embodied struggle. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation to "integrate laughter into healing" is specific and drives the closure choice (the crocodile tooth reveal), but his interior texture remains somewhat spare—we get "modestly fearless" calm without much contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The General's transformation from rage to laughter is earned through the tooth's memory, showing internal conflict resolved by a visible shift in stance. Minor deduction: Elian's reactions to the spectral confessions and roaring are observed externally rather than felt as contradictory impulses; the "calm demeanor one might use to sweep a dusty floor" operates more as label than lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's proprioceptive hyper-awareness is shown through embodied detail ("precise rotation of his axis," "distance between his floating ribs"), and his somatic memory drives navigation credibly. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical constructs ("mathematics of mercy," "integer of his own survival") that risk distancing the reader from lived experience. The final transformation—becoming "a component of the forest"—is asserted more than earned through micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses in scene. Motivation remains anchored in intellectual puzzle-solving rather than visceral want versus fear tension.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving his investigation of the painting. Interiority is vivid with embodied sensations ("cold spray of the sea," trembling fingers), though some moments edge toward mystical label-speak ("sensation of an eternal instant"). The emotional progression through discovery to solemn acceptance reads credibly, and the final act of recording the keeper's name feels earned. Internal contradiction is minimal; Elian's competence is balanced by the delicate, uncertain nature of his work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his observational method is character-specific, but his choices feel mechanical rather than pressured by internal conflict. The extraction of the mainspring barrel proceeds without hesitation or cost; he never weighs risk or faces a meaningful tradeoff. Interiority remains functional but lacks embodied contradiction—he waits, observes, acts in smooth sequence. The ghosts intensify atmosphere but don't complicate his decisions, leaving agency feeling more like occupational routine than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation—compressing eternity into a dense moment—is articulated clearly and drives his destructive choice at the press. His embodied details (lead-smudged skin, heavy gait) and philosophical stance are coherent. However, interiority remains largely expository; the final fall reads as fulfillment rather than a choice with visible internal friction. No secondary character pressure tests his resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and embodied in his interactions with the shard and his defiant stance against Thorne's interpretation. His poetic inclination drives concrete choices—covering mirrors, positioning the shard—that reveal character under pressure. However, the final victory feels more gestural than transformative; the "burnished sorrow" returns unchanged, suggesting endurance rather than earned alteration. Thorne remains a cipher whose sole function is opposition, weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized primarily through his craft and singular motivation, with embodied fear ("trembling palm") and micro-choices ("forcing himself to believe") that align with his role. However, his interiority relies heavily on elevated diction and philosophical framing rather than trade-specific thought patterns. The final laugh and slump provide embodied relief, but internal contradiction is minimal—his trajectory moves smoothly from doubt to triumph without meaningful struggle against his own limits. The piece omits any secondary pressure or mistake that would test his competence under the established constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and distinctive—seeking "the place where explanations fail"—and his sensory obsession is embodied through the rebreather apparatus. However, interiority leans toward atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final collection is a success without visible cost or trade-off; he gets exactly what he came for with trembling fingers but no forfeiture or sacrifice dramatized on the page. Backstory about "lifelong compulsion" remains abstract rather than showing a prior micro-choice that this quest forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled clearly—she wants to "scaffold complexity with simplicity"—and her decision to use the lantern slide and sculpture to project a phantom map demonstrates agency under pressure. Internal experience is somewhat embodied (the "turbine-hum reverie," rain streaming down goggles), but interiority leans toward conceptual summary ("timewoven alliances," "layered meanings") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final action is earned by prior setup, but the character reads more as a vehicle for the concept than as a mind wrestling with genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is concrete and her motivation is clear, but her journey from public muralist to solitary seeker is told rather than dramatized. The final choice to paint "the hush of the shadows" is stated rather than shown through a micro-decision that forecloses a prior path. The protagonist's realization about vanity versus generosity lands as conceptual insight without embodied cost or a visible trade-off that alters her immediate options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (truth-seeking archivist) is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads generic at key beats—"suffocating weight of forgotten injustices" and "tears evaporating instantly" are stock gestures. The negotiation with the Scribe through debris arrangement shows agency, but the emotional arc lacks contradiction or lived-in embodiment; she moves from determined to relieved without internal friction. The final choice (preserving his legacy) feels inevitable rather than earned through competing impulses, and the diary's stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to reimagine civilization is clear and her rejection of false comfort shapes her final choice. The mental exertion is embodied through sweat and the strain of holding variables, though the working-memory mechanism reads somewhat abstractly. Internal conflict appears primarily as her determination against the void her neighbors chose, but contradictory impulses don't act simultaneously in scene—she moves linearly toward shattering the bottle. The ending choice feels earned by her stance, though the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vane's motivation is concrete and particular—archiving emotional patterns—and his contradiction (isolated scholar suddenly compelled by one artifact) creates genuine pressure. His specialized skill (dead languages) enables the central action and his response to the Foghorn's silence embodies panic through the "plush, suffocating weight" rather than label-only emotion. The third-grade memory is vivid and specific, providing earned causality for his decisive immersion choice. Minor slip: the architect's grief is asserted rather than fully dramatized through the phonograph's delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interior is rendered through embodied action ("furiously tranquil," fingers on condensation-slicked walls), but his motivation—discovering the texture of borrowed time—is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final act (descending into the vault, handling the pea) feels contemplative rather than decisively closing a visible internal conflict with cost. No secondary character pressure tests his stance, and the piece leans on abstract interiority ("vortex inheritance," "borrowed time") rather than concrete contradictory wants acting in scene. The dominance of reflective, conceptual framing over moment-to-moment choice under pressure keeps this mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout ("credibly curious mind," tracking obsessions beyond paycheck). His final choice—powering down the siren—arises from established values (favor listening over noise) with visible cost (missing protocol, risking his job explanation). The embodied contradiction between duty and reverence operates in scene ("fingers hovering over the primary activation toggle"). Minor slip: some emotional beats edge toward summary rather than micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and her ritual reveals character through embodied action—pressing glass to eye, tracing the meteor's path. Internal contradiction surfaces between her self-perception as "small and unseen" versus her spiritual conviction that "fragility was the precursor to radiance," creating authentic tension. The final shift from seeing dust as "filth" to "holy ash" is earned by the witnessed transformation, though the epiphany verges on over-articulation in the penultimate paragraph. No secondary character pressure tests her stance, but the single-POV frame holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias reads consistently as an "astonished recluse" whose tranquil perceptiveness filters every beat; his refusal to acknowledge the ghosts' pleas is embodied through repeated micro-choices (stepping back, turning away, gazing through the box). Internal contradiction surfaces in his wonder at the ghosts' need for validation while he himself guards unspoken secrets with ritualistic devotion. The woman's spirit provides pressure, and his final smile signals Earned Stasis—he forecloses engagement with cost visible in her wavering form and drained urgency. Minor: the philosophical framing occasionally edges toward tell rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" drives her descent and final discovery, but her internal contradictions remain abstract—"borrowed time" is label-only until the shard stills it. The closing epiphany ("abrasive like ash") feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority operates at a cerebral, slightly diagnostic register ("obsession," "anticipated mysteries") that flattens crisis affect.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to "discover beauty in the incomplete" is coherently embodied through his ritual choices—plucking a ragged feather, weaving the kite's loss into the dawn—but his interiority remains abstract and elevated throughout. The piece never dramatizes an internal contradiction or moment of genuine struggle; he observes, accepts, and harmonizes without friction. The final act of incorporating the snapped string reads as pre-ordained rather than a choice under pressure, foreclosing the visible cost needed for higher bands. Embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is rendered through consistent micro-choices (setting down the pack, deliberate ladder placement, ritualistic coiling) that embody his "brazen calm" and systematic approach. His interiority—fearing unresolved conflict more than death—drives the entire arc with visible cost: his body fails as the orchard succeeds. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between urgency (six-month deadline) and his unhurried execution, creating authentic pressure. The final renunciation (sitting to die as the work completes) is earned by prior causality and forecloses life with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal contradiction is well embodied—she rejects worship while her bioluminescence betrays emotional spikes—and her climb is motivated by scientific skepticism with escalating validation thrill. The final choice to throw the amber feels earned by her arc and carries visible cost (rejecting stasis, committing to rebellion). Minor weaknesses: Aris arrives as a convenient validator rather than applying immediate pressure, and the "artificial pilgrimage" theory is articulated more than dramatized through her own micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas possesses a singular, obsessive motivation—to restore life to a dead battlefield—rendered through concrete action (casting seeds, interpreting bird calls). His interiority is embodied in sensory detail ("heavy coat brushing against mossy railings") and his micro-choices (waiting for the specific cadence, aiming precisely) show embodied agency. However, the character reads more as a vessel for the concept than a genuinely conflicted consciousness; his internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the resolution (green light spreading) arrives without a felt cost or choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is characterized through concrete, embodied detail—his bloodhound past, his visual reading skill, the trembling hands. The motivation to find his lost partner through the cylinder riddle drives clear choices: reaching for the leaf, overlaying it on the grooves, decoding coordinates. Internal conflict is present but could deepen; his despair versus hope is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending choice (lowering the glass, accepting rest) feels earned by the decoding journey, though the cost remains more emotional than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior landscape is richly layered with embodied contradiction: she stands alone in "blessed pariah" silence, fingers trembling on charcoal while squinting at photon streams, her fear of isolation displaced by cartographic resolve. The shift from "desperate need for comfort to a burning desire to turn confusion into exploration" is earned through the glimpse of geometric regularity, though the epiphany moment leans slightly toward articulation rather than raw discovery. Her father's compass applique and the ritual carry personal texture, but the final beat—"she would not just survive the shutdown; she would map the singularity"—edges into direct statement of theme rather than pure dramatic choice. Minor: the "hardening of resolve" phrase abstracts what could have remained embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation—to embrace the unknown—is clear and drives his actions through to the final image. Internal experience shows embodied tension ("his movements possessing a cautious abandon") and the final laugh into the gale demonstrates commitment. However, the interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("apprentice of wonder," "joyful sabotage") rather than specific, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The choice to break the stalemate feels thematically motivated but lacks a visible personal cost or foreclosed path; he stands ready without evident sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is specific and contradictory—"benevolently ruthless" is enacted through his choice to walk the "V" and "S" rather than weep, dramatizing the tradeoff between empathy and documentation. The backstory of crisis-actor-turned-survivor anchors his present stance and the inability to "distinguish between a script and a scar" creates genuine internal friction. The chess move that breaks the sonic feedback is motivated and alters the scene's trajectory. Minor deduction: the transition from professional mimic to historian feels slightly underwritten in the middle, though the cost is visible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand home is clear and her suppressed talents create internal conflict, but the backstory dominates the opening third without concrete present choices until she finds the stone. The micro-choices (touching the stone, running thumb along the quill, pressing stone into mulch) are embodied and purposeful. The final renunciation of nightly escapism as crutch feels earned by the stone's stabilization, though the emotional cost of this shift remains more told than felt in the closure beat. Internal contradiction between fear of her power and need to use it drives the arc adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is presented with consistent motivation (guilt over past teaching → desire to unfreeze time) and the internal contradiction between his strategic ruthlessness and moral burden shapes his arc. The backstory exposition is substantial (~25% by line count) but anchors in the platinum labyrinth fidget and the frozen village, tilting the present choice to pull the anchor thread. The climactic moment "He did not waver. He pulled the thread" demonstrates embodied agency under pressure, though the ease of the solution (finding the knot, pulling it once) slightly undercuts the struggle. The emotional shift from guilt-stasis to exhale-and-continue reads earned, but the lack of on-page bodily cost (no injury, exhaustion detail in the resolution beat) keeps it from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to fracture singular truth is established and drives his choice to disrupt the ritual. His mischievous embodiment ("swung his legs with an innocently mischievous grin") provides texture, though the framing leans observational rather than interior. The Elders remain flat pressure-vessels without distinct agency. Internal contradiction is present (playful versus heretical stakes) but the cost of exile feels declared rather than viscerally weighed in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's desperation to conjure meaning is clearly motivated and embodied through physical action (snatching artifacts, pressing the charm underwater), but her internal landscape remains generic—"paralyzing fear," "uncertainty waned"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ritual choice feels thematically driven rather than character-specific; we don't see what makes *her* select this method over alternatives. The final renunciation (exhaling, accepting death) carries weight, but the transition from fear to certainty reads as declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is rendered through concrete particulars: "intimately aloof, an observer who captured the souls of their grandfathers in oil yet refused to learn their children's names." His grief is embodied in distraction ("missed the marker...distracted by the echo of his own footsteps which sounded too much like her laugh") and his ritual painting of the shell demonstrates contradictory impulses—holding on by letting go. The ending choice (releasing the shell) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though the reflection-heavy middle occasionally tells grief rather than showing micro-choices under present pressure. Interiority remains character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and well-embodied through physical sensation ("screaming tenderness...felt like a physical wound"). Internal conflict between his silent method and the head keeper's doctrine is dramatized rather than told. The passage "his chest heaving, satisfied that the quietest force had screamed the loudest" effectively shows the cost of his effort. Minor slip: the head keeper remains entirely passive, reducing potential relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization is strongly embodied through scarred skin mirroring fragmented charts and her choice to wedge the bronze foot into circuitry despite physical pain. Her motivation to guide spectral travelers is consistent and drives micro-choices (lifting receiver, cranking dish, absorbing sorrow). Interior contradictions emerge subtly in her willingness to absorb pain for others while isolated herself. The final slump and waiting posture complete an arc of endurance with visible cost, though the piece leans toward atmospheric rendering over sharp internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is vividly drawn through his dual curse—empathy virus and involuntary truthfulness—which creates a concrete dilemma that drives every choice. His shift from rational forager to desperate experimenter is earned through embodied fear (the "flood of shared agony," his mouth betraying rations). The final whispered lie functions as both test and triumph, a micro-choice that proves the transformation with visible cost (his tenuous peace built on "bad science"). Minor weakness: the monks and squirrels remain abstract pressures rather than individuated threats, slightly flattening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("borrowed memories," "stolen truths"), and his micro-choice to honor the flower in the lantern room carries visible cost (his isolation "less hollow now"). However, the emotional arc relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the protagonist observes and decodes rather than struggles with competing desires. The backstory about "keepers of the archive" and his role feels expository without altering present choices. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward poetic abstraction ("burning motivation," "heavy burden") rather than visceral contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and rooted in grief; the interiority shows character-particular thought without therapy-speak. The empirically intuitive trait is demonstrated through the ant-following choice, embodying competence under pressure. However, the final step through the portal reads as passive acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a visible alternative on the page; the realization "the promise wasn't to change the past, but to find the courage" edges toward interpretive summary rather than dramatized internal contradiction at the moment of crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Isolde's disenchantment and dream-driven motive are clear, and her choice to climb despite danger reflects consistent traits. The final shift—from disenchanted queen to guardian—is signaled but feels slightly abrupt; the transition from touching fire to closing eyes and waiting lacks a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Valerius serves as presence and minor opposition but remains functional. Interiority is present ("the mystery solved") but leans toward summary rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear and philosophically grounded—capturing "the density of presence" through alchemical craft. His interior world blends concrete procedural choices with abstract yearning, though the character reads more as a vehicle for the concept than as someone wrestling with contradictory impulses. The whispered secret provides an emotional hinge, but Elian's reaction is channeled entirely into his work rather than showing internal conflict. Kaelen's departure is received and instrumentalized without visible struggle or layered response.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is dense and particular—"feral nostalgia that tears at my throat with wolfish teeth" embodies contradiction effectively. The method of jealousy-as-hook that induces lucid flight is specific and motivated. However, the transformation or renunciation feels more reported than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure; the chronicler observes rather than decides at closure, capping the category below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is well-drawn through his compensatory skill—reading micro-tensions after losing smell—and his motivation to "humanize the cold, brass equation" drives the core choice to offer the screw. The interiority is concrete and embodied ("inhaled the damp silence"), and the micro-choice to place the relic carries visible cost (surrendering a family heirloom). Kael's softening is legible through action and gesture, though his arc remains secondary and somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's crystallization trait is embodied viscerally and shapes every choice under pressure. Her turn from "rigid academic incantations" to nursery rhyme is motivated by desperation and earned through the physical constraint. The final act of shedding carries visible cost—"visceral and sharp, tearing at the boundaries of who she was"—and the progression from panic to agency reads as genuine character transformation. Minor deduction: the binary between logic/superstition could be more internally contradictory; her pivot feels clean rather than ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's profession as both scandal writer and supernatural remover is established through action and voice-specific metaphors ("grief is like water trapped in a blocked pipe"), creating a coherent interiority. Elena's motivation is clearly established—overdue apology driving the ritual—but her character remains thinly sketched beyond grief; the father's acceptance lacks embodied complexity at the climax. The "hollow ache of his profession" ending gesture feels asserted rather than earned through prior contradiction. Minor penalty for the father's silent-scream manifestation reading more as special effect than embodied emotion with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared (unraveling cosmic illusions) but her interior life remains abstract through most of the piece—she "knew," "felt the pull," "realized" in label-only fashion. The dictionary clutch and the whispered word "unify" provide embodied micro-choices, but the protagonist reads more as a vessel for cosmic metaphor than a person with contradictory impulses. Emotional progression is thin; the piece moves from cosmic dread to resolution without layered internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a personal path.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is concrete and specific—"time was a butchery" rather than a river—and his trance-state method (backward count anchoring heartbeat) embodies contradiction between hydraulic profession and geared obsession. The final realization that "measurement was never about quantification, but about containment" is earned by prior on-page experience with the key and the razor edges. Minor deduction: the horror at "removing the bandage" arrives quickly; a beat of resistance before acceptance would deepen internal conflict. Embodied emotion ("vertigo," "vibrated up his arm bone") grounds the crisis effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's interior contradiction is credible—probability rigor versus metaphysical hypothesis—and the stent detail embodies vulnerability without therapy-speak. The father contrast establishes her calculative mode, and the final peace acceptance feels earned by the prior terror-turned-methodology. Minor slip: "a profound sense of peace" leans toward label rather than embodied perception, pulling back from 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is rendered through consistent, embodied choices: wetting his finger, adjusting the glass disc under pressure, timing the severance before regret. His motivation ("to teach endings how to begin") is dramatized through patient micro-choices rather than declared. Internal contradiction is thin—he never doubts the work or wrestles with competing impulses—and the resolution (preparing for the next call) is more endurance than earned change with visible cost. The woman and old man remain voices without agency, preventing relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is embodied through the walnut-stained hands and the ritual's physical precision, and her motivation to preserve "small moments" shapes every choice. The internal contradiction between "haunted euphoria" and grief creates complexity, though the emotion occasionally slips toward label-only ("terrifying presence," "warm, invisible blanket"). The final renunciation—dropping the locket—carries visible cost and forecloses return, satisfying the earned-change requirement. Minor deduction for the therapeutic register in "joy so intense it felt like a ghost passing through her ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arthur's motivation is clear and embodied through his defensive humor and the physical moon rock. His internal contradiction—mastering logistics while paralyzed by personal connection—drives the core choice to discard the rock, foreclosing the transactional path with visible cost. The woman's entrance and violin offer sufficient pressure to earn the shift. Minor deduction: her characterization remains somewhat instrumental, though her "shared moment is the only currency" line carries thematic weight and the final beat lands cleanly on Arthur's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's grief-driven motivation is clear and her unusual ability shapes her journey, but her choices lack meaningful internal contradiction. The frantic syntax absorption and her trust in the ring guide her forward without visible hesitation or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final forgiveness washes over her rather than emerging from a dramatized struggle between contradictory desires. Embodied emotion is present (tears, gasping) but the peak beat leans toward received epiphany rather than earned through on-page wrestling with flawed instincts.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's interior voice shows purposeful contradiction ("confidently uncertain," "arrogant flourish of a god" while "guessing"), and his embodied actions (unbending the nib, gripping the pen) reveal tactile engagement. However, motivation remains abstract: "thresh meaning from experience" and "editing history" are told stakes without visible personal cost or renunciation. The final satisfaction ("finally readable") reads as comfort rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority leans heavily on abstract labels—"joyful sorrow," "poignant happiness"—rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The advisor remains a cipher whose motivations and internal state are never dramatized; she functions as a device rather than a character with her own stake. The final weeping feels unmotivated by prior on-page micro-choices that would credibly build to that emotional release. While the piece attempts interior complexity, the execution relies on declaration over embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation—volcanic tenderness for a dead world and for Kael—is embodied in her movements and choices. The narrative establishes her analytical intuition through concrete action (reading the statue's arm angle, connecting tapestry fragments). However, the final beat relies heavily on interpretive gestures rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible cost; she completes a circuit Kael built, but no live option is sacrificed. Internal contradiction is present (arsonist turned protector) but remains static rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to preserve Lena's memory is clear and drives his actions, with embodied details like drumming tension and the physical sensation of the neural pull. The final choice—trading sanity for the shared dream—is dramatized, though the cost is slightly abstracted ("purchased with his sanity") rather than shown through on-page breakdown or specific forfeiture of a concrete ability. Internal conflict is present (grief vs. rebellion) but could be more contradictory; he pursues his goal with focused determination rather than wrestling competing impulses in the peak moments. The researchers remain distant observers, so no secondary pressure complicates his path.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and character-specific: the "whispers travel farther than shouts" ethos drives his trap-setting with concrete micro-choices (tossing the key, folding the map, grounding the rod). Kael's characterization is thinner—his loud, breathless pursuit functions mostly as contrast rather than independent interiority. The ending forecloses a path (Elias vanishes, Kael is trapped) but Kael's agency is minimal; the closure choice belongs entirely to Elias without visible internal conflict or cost, limiting the felt weight of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits silent empathy through embodied action—angling the dental mirror, manipulating cranks—but his interior remains opaque; we observe purpose without internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The woman's grief is sketched through physical cues (white knuckles, trembling, sharp breath), yet her arc compresses into passive reception rather than choice. The motivation to "teach darkness the value of stars" reads as authorial overlay rather than emerging from dramatized fear or want. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; the ending reconfigures the woman's stance without her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his telepathic gift creates internal texture, but his choices feel more facilitative than agonizing—he orchestrates from a position of control rather than wrestling contradictory impulses in the moment. The children remain undifferentiated beyond "buzzing with algorithms," functioning as choral rather than individuated pressure. The final gesture (cradling the king) reads symbolic rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but doesn't degrade under stress in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's characterization is clear and embodied through action—graceful dock work, compassionate physicality, use of the scrimshaw to unlock emotional barriers. Vane's internal conflict between rigidity and transformation is dramatized through physical resistance becoming embrace. The transformation at the end (gills, aquatic nature) feels earned through the escalating physical and emotional pressure. Minor slip: Vane's motivation for staying lashed to the bollard could have been seeded slightly earlier to fully ground his terror of fluidity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is concrete and his performance registers as embodied contradiction—he shouts theatrical commentary while "his heart remained perfectly, terrifyingly still." The moral ambiguity is on the page: he's "selling out his past to purchase his safety," turning survival into erasure. Internal conflict operates simultaneously (loud external performance vs. frozen interior state) rather than alternating. The final achievement of "lightness" and "zero-gravity existence" earns the emotional void through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is established early and her technique of dissolving observer/observed drives the action. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic phrasing ("raw language of the atmosphere," "paraphrase the divine thunder") that distances us from embodied choice-making. The climactic realization "that the separation had never been real" arrives as summary epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The visible cost—transgression of sacred law—is declared but not felt as internal friction or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout ("her boots crunched," "she knelt," "she tilted her head"), and her motivations flow from a consistent aesthetic philosophy shaped by her colorblindness. The final smile after Silas's "messy and partial" awakening crystallizes her hierarchy of values—imperfection over polish—with visible cost (she cherished the rusted reed, gave it away). Minor slip: Silas's damaged eyes feel more asserted than dramatized, and the Glassblower remains a functional obstacle rather than a fully individuated presence, though at this length a single opponent may serve as pure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" is articulated but remains abstract; her mid-scene realization ("What if the light generated by the prism-song could be given physical mass?") feels slightly abrupt rather than earned by prior embodied contradiction. Kael's grief is told more than shown through micro-choices, and his disappointment crumples without layered internal resistance. The final moment succeeds emotionally, but the path there lacks the embodied, contradictory impulses that would lift this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "teach withering to bloom again" is clear and his craft process is well-detailed, but his interiority remains largely static—subdued ardor described once rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. The woman's transformation at the end feels observed rather than earned through her own micro-choices; she arrives broken and leaves straightened by Elias's alchemy, not her own agency. Embodied emotion is present in "her voice dry as dead leaves" and "clutching it as though it contained her own heartbeat," but the therapeutic framing ("trapped behind the curtains of intention") edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient complication. The protagonist-as-facilitator design limits internal conflict visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is motivated by intellectual curiosity to map cultural patterns, embodied through his methodical measuring rituals. His decision to confide ("breach of protocol that made his pulse hammer") shows internal contradiction between observer role and moral witness, but the turn feels more stated than lived—we're told he "could no longer keep objective distance" rather than watching him struggle through micro-choices. The client remains a cipher, present only to receive exposition. Silas's "steadily curious" trait appears as label rather than dramatized through competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear, and the chaotic dance shows embodied struggle. However, her interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and the final emotional response ("laughed and sobbed simultaneously") is stated rather than dramatized through specific perception or micro-choice. The transformation from innocence to resolve is declared but not earned through a visible on-page cost that forecloses a path; we are told her faith burns away, but no specific choice or renunciation demonstrates that loss. Elevated diction ("anguished joy," "vestiges of her childhood faith") bypasses embodied interiority in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is signaled early and his custodian role shapes his actions throughout. The woman's shadow-loss provides coherent stakes, though her agency remains entirely off-page. Interiority carries distinct philosophical weight ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," the carved-out space of hope), but the final moment—placing the stone and feeling "luminous regret"—edges toward label-only emotion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece earns its Earned Stasis closure (Elian preserves the fragment but cannot restore wholeness), yet the woman's absence and the collective mind's unexamined passivity limit relational crucible and secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clearly dramatized through contradictory impulses—her desire to chase Julian versus the immediate need to save the chameleon. Internal conflict is embodied through trembling hands and the specific work of debriding tissue, not summarized. The parallel shedding (creature's poisoned skin / her naivety) risks schematic neatness but remains grounded in surgical action. Micro-choices under pressure (picking up the scalpel, hushing the animal, excising layers) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias exhibits clear internal contradiction—the "closure seeker who opens wounds"—dramatized through his frantic digging despite surgical pain. His motivation to "read the stories in scars" drives concrete choices (examining coffee rings, tunneling through floor) with embodied cost (tearing stitches, bleeding through bandages). The plant telepathy remains somewhat ornamental until the final beat, where touch triggers the lullaby shift. Minor deduction for the labeling of his contradiction in exposition rather than letting it emerge entirely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and distinct—finding where unused love is stored—and her spatial imagination trait generates concrete action (extruding the train station, building pillars of regret). Interiority is richly embodied through psychometric touch and warming the film. However, the piece leans heavily on her executing a solitary process without meaningful internal contradiction or a choice that forecloses a visible path; the final "transition complete" reads more like task completion than a renunciation or transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority carries strong particularity ("deafening noise of potentiality"), but emotional progression flattens in the climax: "crushing him" and "gasping" lean toward generic suffering without embodied contradiction. The pivot from frantic effort to surrender feels motivated by exhaustion rather than internal conflict—he simply stops when overwhelmed. Micro-choices exist (raising the instrument, tracing trajectories, releasing), yet the final smile lacks the weight of a genuinely foreclosed path; no visible cost or renunciation registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is signaled early and remains consistent—he tends the archive to preserve potentiality—but his interiority leans abstract and label-driven ("dreamless freight guard," "billion unlived lives"). The quantum dispersion sequence offers embodied cost (gasping shudder, taste of ozone), yet the emotional stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally contradictory. The final choice to maintain the seal reads as duty performed rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and grounded in specifics (rigid logic, sixth sense awakening), and his emotions are embodied through physical sensation (copper taste, temple throb). The interior texture is distinct, and the final shift—from fearing displacement to accepting the mind as frontier—is earned by the turbine sequence. However, the epiphany ("gear had not fixed the machine; it had liberated it") edges toward over-articulated insight without sufficient ambiguity or cost visible in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The passenger shows clear interiority ("pressing his hands against the hollow space") and embodied emotion (shivering, trembling legs), but his arc feels too smooth—he moves from pain to claiming his will without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses complicating the journey. Elara remains observational throughout; her "practiced empathy of centuries" is told rather than tested by a difficult choice. The final realization ("the leash had not been holding him back; it had been holding him up") reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through narration rather than discovered through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his physical suffering (nerve regeneration) is embodied concretely throughout, driving micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears in his final stance—weaponizing silence rather than fleeing—and the cost of remaining is legible. The secondary "silent-choir" context is told rather than shown in interaction, and the final choice, while earned by the bolt discovery, could deepen if prior scenes tested his understanding more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orel's motivation is clear and his "diminutive titan" trait generates consistent choices: he remains rooted while the Pretender floats, a physical proof of legitimacy. Internal experience is embodied through the concrete action of dissolving the pellet and inscribing the rune. The Pretender's panic is vivid, but he functions primarily as a reactive foil rather than a pressure source with agency; his arrogance is told more than shown in micro-choices. Orel's "calm and sorrowful" close reads slightly generic given the scale of what he's just accomplished—more contradictory impulses in that final beat would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation (discovering why paths disappear) is clear and embodied through his tapping practice and workspace arrangement. His memory of coral bleaching provides concrete interior detail that drives present investigation. The final realization—road consumed by super-coral—arrives via sustained data work rather than convenience, though the emotional response to the discovery remains understated. Minor deduction: the character's voice in reflection occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("visceral smell of the rot," "gnawing motivation") that edges past what feels strictly character-bound under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and her embodied action (barefoot, absorbing tremors) is specific, but her internal experience remains thin—we see her "burning" motivation and "tears" at the end without the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle that would earn higher bands. The "awkwardly confident" trait is stated in the demeanor description but never dramatizes a cost or complication in her choices. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so the relationship bullets don't apply; the soldiers watching from catwalks are scenic furniture. The final act (reigniting the core) feels more like a ritual fulfillment than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she intends to resurrect the world against Council stagnation—but her interior life remains thin. The "cursed" telepathy with plants is label-only until the moss warns her; no contradictory impulses or genuine doubt appear, leaving her competent but flat. The final triumph gesture reads as declared rather than earned through visible internal cost or foreclosed paths. Embodied emotion is sparse; the trembling fingers are the sole physical marker of stress.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through concrete somatic detail ("cold constriction tightening his gut," tactile anchoring via the photograph) and his interior contradictions—freezing as "deliberate cessation" versus the screaming impulse to dive—are dramatized in real time. The grafting work provides a credible skill set and the final choice to bind orchid to pine root grounds his values in action with visible cost (marrying fragility to survival). Minor slip: the "drone strike wedding survivor" label reads slightly diagnostic and the interiority occasionally edges toward therapy-speak ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness"), but these are quickly grounded in physical sensation and do not flatten the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior state is densely rendered through metaphor ("maddening analytical loop that had ruined his art") and embodied action (touching the box, gripping fractured light). His motivation to escape surfaces clearly, though the final choice—descending rather than continuing to struggle—arrives with minimal on-page friction between competing impulses. The twin rhetorical questions function more as character signature than dramatized internal conflict that visibly costs him something in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is given distinct interior texture through "serene anger" and the cultivated wolf-mind state, but his motivation remains largely told rather than tested under contradictory impulses. The final turn—deciding to "track the pattern now, not the man"—lands as a cognitive pivot but lacks visible emotional cost or foreclosed path; it reads more like strategic adjustment than transformation. Kaelen's appearance is too brief to generate relational pressure, functioning primarily as delivery mechanism for the ink spectacle. The phrase "consciously wild" is asserted but not dramatized through micro-choices that show the cost of shedding civilization.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies coherently through her conflict between preservation duty and truth-telling imperative. Her embodied fear ("trembling gloved hand") and the physical act of throwing the switch demonstrate agency under pressure. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("bravely conflicted," "friction of the decision burning") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Kael's entrance provides external pressure but his characterization remains thin—keeper of lies without distinct traits or micro-choices that complicate the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation and internal conflict are clear—she rejects her father's violence for pacifism—but the character relies heavily on abstract interiority ("hyper-awareness," "chaotic vibrations") rather than embodied contradictory impulses. The sheathing choice reads as inevitable from her established stance rather than a struggle between competing desires in the moment. The stranger's presence triggers memory of "old instinct" but this phantom inheritance dissolves without genuine friction, reducing the final turn to confirmation rather than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal state is consistently embodied through breathing control and "cool-headed" focus under acoustic pressure, and her final catch demonstrates earned competence. However, interiority remains largely observational; we see her refuse panic and force air to "smooth into transparent glass," but contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene—she maintains flat affect throughout. The closure choice (reeling in the echo) feels inevitable given her established skill, yet no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies the capture; she remains "impassive" with only a residual "claw" at her mind. Minor penalty for lack of dramatized internal conflict at the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is signaled clearly and her method (proof by contradiction) is embodied through concrete action—retrieving the pen, examining ledgers, placing the call. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("orbits of regret," "gravitational coherence") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice feels more like executing a pre-formed plan than wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. No visible cost attends the decision; Sterling's embarrassment is reported, not felt as sacrifice or foreclosure for Eleanor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's guilt-driven motivation is consistently embodied through her trembling hands and the tactile work with the stylus-as-tattoo-gun. The backstory moment ("where there should have been a lullaby") is brief but anchors her present desperation. Internal contradiction surfaces when she whispers "Stay with me" while working feverishly—care layered with technical urgency. The final act of holding the warm amber with its constellation-like fractures shows earned change, though the prior causality could be tighter; the guilt transforms into peaceful rest rather than erasure, a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his socially perceptive nature is embodied through his ability to distinguish specific voices in chaos. The final choice to destroy the mandala feels earned, though the character remains more vessel than contradictory agent—his whimsical artist traits don't meaningfully complicate his actions under pressure. Interiority leans toward labeled states ("colorful anxiety," "satisfied") rather than fully embodied perception, and the stakes test his craft more than his internal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit 734's internal contradiction—nurturing aberrant mercy as "the architecture of his soul"—is embodied through concrete action (brushing snow from faces, venting heat) rather than told. The child's terror and warming are shown through physical markers. The protagonist's malfunctioning chronometer and ghost algorithms ground the psychic distance, though "aberrant mercy" and "gentle radical" edge toward label-speak. The final choice to shield the child is earned by prior moves, with a clear cost: battery drain and network deception risk.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Barnaby's motivation is clear and consistently voiced through synesthetic perception, but his interiority relies heavily on sensory metaphor ("cold, bitter ash," "sweet, golden flavor") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Clara's shift from despair to resolve is compressed into a single beat without visible internal friction or micro-choices that dramatize the cost of her decision. The final choice feels inevitable from atmosphere rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is embodied through the shaking hands "attuned to a frequency" and the physical weight shifts during the exposure. The somatic guidance method shows embodied emotion without therapy-speak. Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—proving beauty within chaos—and the final spine-straightening registers her shift credibly. Minor slip: "willowglass hope" in the final beat flirts with ornamental metaphor, but the posture change grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent (to become "the voice of the unknown"), but her choices are largely observational rather than testing contradictory impulses under pressure. The fossil functions as a told-about transitional object rather than an embodied contradiction that forces micro-choices on the page. Internal experience remains abstract—"crushing isolation," "racing synapses"—without specific embodied sensation or struggle that would reveal character hierarchy. The ending declares she "successfully bridged the gap" without a visible cost or foreclosed path that demonstrates genuine endurance or alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to transform prophecy is clear and sustained, and the button-cataloging work embodies his methodical nature. However, his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses arise during the work, and the final inversion feels inevitable rather than a choice with visible cost. The "quietly inspired" attribute is mentioned but never constrains an action or creates friction. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we see grace and reverence but no sweat, doubt, or physical toll during the hours-long process.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is grounded and specific—reclaation through proof rather than death—but his interiority leans toward summary ("the source of his burning, the branding of cowardice") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodiment is present (trembling palm, breath plumes) yet minor beats rely on expository loops ("fixing what's broken, be it a shattered hinge or a fractured loyalty"). The final choice is earned and forecloses the path of self-destruction with visible cost, but the arc feels more linear than internally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas shows clear motivation (distilling complexity) enacted through concrete action with the yarn needle, and the woman's palimpsest burden is embodied rather than merely declared. However, the piece leans heavily on metaphorical description—"ambient awareness," "knot of anxiety," "thick scarred document"—where more direct embodiment of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously would sharpen the work. The woman's transformation feels compressed; we see weight lifting but not the internal friction of competing loyalties in real time. Silas remains more archetype than individual, his serenity never tested by a choice that costs him something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is given a clear philosophical motivation and his actions (centering the clay, responding to the thrum, pressing the lantern glass) track to his zen-minded stance. Interiority is mostly concrete, though the epiphany about phototropic kindness arrives suddenly without embodied contradiction or struggle. The final choice—honoring the oasis rather than fixing the wasteland—is earned by prior causality and forecloses intervention with visible cost. Minor issue: no genuine internal conflict; Silas moves smoothly through revelation without resistance or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's devotion to the roses, acceptance of their death, and immediate pivot to the mirror apparatus show a character whose actions stem from consistent internal logic. The transition from biological to mechanical care is embodied through concrete choices—using the gauge tooth, working the mechanism with rowing rhythm, adjusting angles microscopically. The "wistfully pragmatic" attribute is enacted rather than merely labeled, visible in his sigh and stoic nod before moving to the apparatus. Minor weakness: the old woman remains an object of his care rather than a pressure source, so the relationship operates in one direction without complicating his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior contradiction—drowning in past lives versus forging autonomous selfhood—operates consistently throughout, and the final stance (witness rather than graveyard) is earned by the stone circle sequence. Embodied details are present (cold stone, teeth vibrating, breath seizing) but lean toward generic sensory catalog rather than character-particular perception. The shift from "suffocating isolation" to "autonomy" feels stated more than dramatized through micro-choices; the circuit through memory → terror → resolve reads clean but arrives via reflection rather than on-page friction with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (finding "the thread that connects all things") is present but abstract; her choice to place the twig spiral feels more symbolic than causally earned by prior struggle. The voiceless client exists only in backstory, rendering the central relationship ornamental rather than pressured. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from observer to actor without visceral cost or competing impulses at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (outwit cosmic tricksters) is signaled early and drives his peak choice. His embodied stress ("trembling hands," "sweat dripped") supports the action beats, but internal contradiction is thin—he works frantically yet remains functionally competent throughout without visible failure or genuine doubt. The final micro-choice (cigarette) feels token rather than earned by prior contradiction. "Cautiously hopeful" is labeled in exposition but not dramatized through a foregrounded cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and prudent nature create authentic internal conflict that drives the climactic choice to stay at the organ rather than flee. The embodied panic ("heart hammered," walls "breathing down on her") and the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—terror screaming to run versus calculation holding her fast—read as genuinely lived. The final exhaustion and the micro-choice to pocket the compass point before leaving anchor the transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction: "wistful rebellion" as an emotional label feels slightly diagnostic rather than fully embodied in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's prosopagnosia is introduced clearly and motivates his detachment, but the trait functions more as premise than internal contradiction—he never wrestles with competing impulses in scene. The final moment ("he recognized the reaction it provoked") offers earned observation but not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Miller's transformation is told through narration ("his hardened expression crumbled") rather than dramatized through micro-choices or embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's mission motivation is clear and her physical anxiety embodied through trembling hands and respirator adjustment. Her internal drive to honor Silas is consistent throughout. However, her characterization stays largely static—there's no internal contradiction or genuine struggle that evolves on the page; she arrives idealistic and executes the ritual successfully without visible cost to her beliefs or identity. The final tears are stated rather than earned through a trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas is given an occupation and a trait ("dynamically observant"), but his interior life relies heavily on abstract epiphanies rather than embodied contradiction. The hitchhiker's vanishing and the final decision to play music feel more symbolic than causally earned by prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority often drifts into elevated, therapeutic phrasing ("pixelated amnesty," "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") that no one thinks mid-crisis. The final act—playing the fiddle to stabilize the glitch—reads as a gesture of acceptance, but the cost of this choice (what he forecloses, what he loses) remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's interiority is concrete and consistent—his calm is rooted in lineage and embodied through gesture (thumbing worthless currency, reading predatory eyes). The father-son parallel provides internal contradiction (defending territory only to watch it starve), and the final choice to walk away is earned by visible cost. Minor slip: Julian and the acquisition team remain functional props without distinct pressure; the junior developers are mentioned but never individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is often ornamental rather than pressurized—she "knew," "believed," "felt" in declarative summary without micro-choices under strain. The figure in the dream is given allegorical weight but remains a static manifestation; his crushing burden lifts through Elara's words without his own agency or visible internal conflict. The transition "Her motivation was consuming and specific" tells rather than showing contradiction or cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the final "finally at rest" reads as assertion rather than earned exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's core motivation ("finds lost things") is established and drives his presence at the lake, but his interior life remains thin—he observes with "warlike serenity" yet we see little contradictory impulse or embodied emotion under pressure. The decision to use the seed feels procedural rather than forced by genuine internal conflict. Verrick is frozen and passive throughout, offering no dynamic pressure or relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jaren's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his jittery mixture of terror and hope is embodied through trembling palms and buckling knees. Elara's transformation into a root-bound visionary is physically specific with half-bark hands and silver fractal lines. The linking-through-scars choice is dramatized with visible cost (cold electricity, pain radiating from his arm), and the final decision to restore balance is earned by the psychic journey. Internal conflict operates simultaneously—anxiety spiked yet inextricably bound to elation—though the peak choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's internal drive is clear and embodied throughout—his reckless idealism materializes in concrete micro-choices (carving sigils, pressing the card, offering his certainty). The "fiercely gentle" contradiction appears in action ("caressing the rough wood and brittle bone with the tenderness of a mother") and the final trade proves costly with visible foreclosure. Interiority remains specific to his mission; no therapy-speak intrudes. The final slump and emptiness earn the change without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is characterized through embodied action and clear internal contradiction—the ex-roadie in a suit, clinging to facts as armor against emotional fallout. His interiority is concrete ("his heart hammering a rhythm that felt uncomfortably like the opening drums") and his physical choices (brute-forcing the rotting wood) reveal hierarchy of values. The final realization—steward rather than profiteer—is earned by the on-page hunt and discovery, though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulation rather than pure dramatization. Minor deduction for the somewhat tidy resolution of his anxiety in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent: understand the physics of transition via linguistic metaphor. The character demonstrates embodied grief through methodical action—brushing soil with the same patience as ancient tablets—and makes genuine choices under pressure (planting the seed to stabilize the station). Internal contradiction surfaces when he both mourns and seeks comprehension, with the final choice to merge Aris into the arbor foreclosing personal recovery in favor of shared continuity. Minor slip: the "touching distance" final moment reads slightly abstract rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is embodied through his mechanical form and labor, and his actions show consistent purpose. The interiority—"preserve wonder in routine"—drives his decision to fuse contradictions rather than separate them, a meaningful choice that forecloses the easier path. The emotional arc from observation to "spark of satisfaction" is concrete and earned. Minor deduction: the protagonist's interior voice occasionally leans toward elevated philosophical diction that sits at the edge of his mechanic-librarian register.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's peculiar talent ("acquires abandoned hopes") is label-heavy and never shown in concrete action with cost—he "senses" stress points but we never see him struggle or make a trade-off tied to this trait. His choice to place the pearl is motivated more by sudden epiphany ("his true motivation was not to secure the perimeter, but to dissolve the walls between hearts") than by on-page contradiction or pressure; the decision feels unmotivated by prior beats. Internal conflict is asserted rather than dramatized: he weeps at the climax, but the emotional shift from isolated hoarder to liberated connector lacks embodied friction. The final renunciation (not sealing the bunker) forecloses a path, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interior is concrete and character-particular—the choice to interpret graffiti as prophecy flows from his unmedicated state, and the final accordion performance embodies contradictory impulses (ritual apology, instrumental failure). Embodiment is strong: the accordion "wheezed," tape "crinkling like an old lung." However, the phrase "cataloging its swirls not for a map, but for the salvation of his soul" in the final paragraph tilts toward diagnostic label-speak, and the cost of the ending (weeping, allowing himself to sit) is visible but borders on soft; the choice to play the accordion does not foreclose a live option with measurable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is grounded in specific embodied detail—the watch heating, cautious exuberance as "fragile blend"—and her micro-choices (closing eyes, catching text in periphery) reveal method under pressure. However, the narration often tells emotional state ("terror and thrill," "rush of triumph") rather than letting contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final smile and "eager to bear" land as summative rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation is consistently embodied through his psychic interaction with plants and the mulberry ache metaphor. His final choice to transform the violin rather than merely destroy it shows character-particular reasoning earned by the setup. The internal conflict between his role as provenance researcher and his treasonous intent creates authentic tension, though the contradiction could have been more actively dramatized in a middle beat. Minor weakness: the ivy's encouragement feels slightly convenient rather than presenting a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular and concrete—capture Vane's essence before entropic dissolution—and her specialized skill set is vividly particularized. The act of transfer feels earned through her concentration and vitality cost ("pouring her own vitality into the transfer"). However, interiority leans heavily on metaphysical description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the professional competence is unshaken by genuine struggle or micro-hesitation that would reveal internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clearly embodied in her actions—climbing to think, using the hairpin as both tool and anchor. Her internal contradiction between duty and the search for contentment drives the closure choice with visible cost (releasing the trapped soul releases her own ancient hurt). The forgiveness backstory is concrete and alters her present stance, but the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("paralyzed by the same terror," "accumulated grime of existence"). The final realization that contentment is a byproduct of release is earned through on-page action and forecloses the active search with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and purposeful ("sincerely insincere" smile, professional detachment), and his micro-choices (unhooking the cloak, holding the mirror) carry agency. Vance's transformation from monolithic conviction to questioning is earned through the mirror encounter. However, Vance's embodied emotion relies heavily on stock gestures (trembling hand, gasping, stumbling) and the final state feels too tidy—he transitions from weapon to moral weigher without sufficient contradictory impulse acting *in* scene. The "terrified, lonely boy" reveal reads as psychological shorthand rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "teach vanishing to appear" is clearly established and drives her pedagogical withholding. Her backward-aging condition provides embodied stakes and a visible countdown. Kael's desperation is legible in his insistent demand for formulae, though his shift from "storming the fortress" to understanding feels somewhat abrupt; the trance mechanism does much of the work. The final realization—"It became the motion"—lands as earned insight rather than mere declaration, though Kael's interior contradiction could be more finely layered throughout the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas shows clear motivation and embodied purpose through his practiced observation of the crows and the tactile handling of the arrowhead. His decades-long entrapment and the anchoring detail of dust at his ankles ground his stakes. The final choice to walk "guided by the memory of the echo" demonstrates earned agency, though the interiority remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "his consciousness tethered to the reverberations" border on telling rather than showing the shift. Internal contradiction is muted; we see resolve more than genuine struggle against doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her rejection of neural links shapes her climb. The interior texture is specific—"dissolving her physical form into the freezing vapor"—and the final choice to unstrap the regulatory pack shows genuine cost. However, the moment of slotting the keystone lacks embodied struggle or contradiction; it sigs rather than clicks, which reads as convenience. The transformation feels declared more than earned through visible internal conflict at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's internal life reads concrete and embodied: "told himself he was simply retrieving lost property" shows self-deception shaped by grief. His arc from night-shift hiding to accepting dawn through the violet vow is earned by the descent and release. Interiority remains particular—no therapy-speak—and the final moment forecloses his fear of silence with visible cost (carrying the memory back to the surface). Mild deduction: the secondary character (the woman) exists only in reflection; no on-page pressure tests the relationship except Silas's memory.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hiero's interiority is concrete and embodied through his interaction with the coins and his listening method. His motivation (preserving the past to seed the future) drives the scene consistently, and the closing moment shows "stellar doubt" pressing against his persistence without therapy-speak. The final gesture—gathering coins to continue despite doubt—demonstrates endurance with visible cost (the suffocating feeling, the weight of futility). Minor slip: the "quietly enthusiastic" trait is labeled rather than shown through gesture or micro-choice in action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas exhibits clear motivation—finishing her work to transform nameless fears—and his grief is embodied through tactile interaction with her objects. However, the final transformation feels more procedural than emotionally earned; the "crushing weight in his chest lightened" tells rather than dramatizes the shift. Internal contradiction is minimal; he moves through grief in a near-linear path without the messy simultaneity of contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "distant intimacy" registers but the renunciation or alteration lacks a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and embodied: his singular devotion to repair manifests in trembling fingers, wide unblinking eyes, and micro-adjustments of suspended droplets. The "earnestly naive spirit" reads as both trait and tragic flaw—he believes instructions from a dream can fix a planet and remains innocent of the cosmic danger he courts. Internal contradiction surfaces when his "lukewarm" magic paradoxically suits the task; his lack of passion for fire or ice becomes the necessary stasis. The final act—striking the bell and watching the geyser—completes an arc of brittle devotion without epiphany, maintaining character consistency to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent: he curates memory to transform loss into remembrance. His actions—planting photos, arranging the sapphire shard—are goal-driven and constrained by time before the townspeople arrive. However, his interior is thin; we see strategic thinking but little embodied emotion or contradiction under pressure. The final climb feels like mission-accomplished rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated and the inner conflict between logic and intuition is thematized throughout. However, the actual character work relies heavily on telling rather than embodied contradiction—she "forced herself to silence that inner voice" and "opened herself to the core concept" through narration rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The sister's ribbon is mentioned but never constrains a present action. The final transformation reads as an epiphany delivered by authorial assertion ("she had done it; she had bridged the divide") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's motivation is embodied through specific action—blocking Lyra's view, relying on muscle memory, maintaining professional detachment despite internal chaos. The watcher's burden manifests in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously: terror balanced against monk-like calm, the need to preserve trust while knowing disaster's proximity. Internal state differs consistently from external behavior throughout the harness revision. Minor slip: "adrenaline storming through his veins" edges toward stock physiology at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is established—seeking to restore emotion—but his interior life reads more as abstraction than embodied contradiction. The "wandering ghost in a synthetic shell" and "data points in a corrupted file" rely on label-only interiority rather than specific, micro-choices under pressure. The final beat (feeling panic and hope) occurs off-page via remote link rather than through on-page struggle, weakening agency. Vane exists only to deliver exposition and vanish, applying no genuine relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and emotionally embodied—guilt over silencing his family drives the desperate ritual. Internal contradiction appears in "mournfully eager," showing simultaneous grief and hope, and his physical collapse at the daughter's laughter demonstrates embodied emotion. However, the piece leans heavily on summary of past regret ("the dinner table of his former life") rather than present micro-choices under pressure, and the final transformation feels more asserted than earned through on-page agency. The backstory fragment anchors present action but occupies substantial space without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The feral guardian's interior life is richly embodied—dimensional homesickness creates tangible ache, and the contradiction between pruning instinct and newfound curiosity drives the climactic restraint. The shift from predator to observer is earned through loneliness made concrete ("ozone and old paper"). Minor deduction: the cultist remains more catalyst than character, his interiority sketched rather than inhabited, and the "make friends with uncertainty" motivation arrives as summary in paragraph four rather than emerging through earlier micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is consistently filtered through alchemical metaphors and embodied in tactile, physical interaction with materials. The successive-approximation attempts show genuine struggle with visible micro-choices (crushing the first lump, recognizing the error of imposing order). However, the final epiphany—"life was the interruption of order"—arrives as an articulated insight rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the stoic exterior remains largely static without internal friction dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and task-focused, with embodied detail (hydraulic grease, rose-colored luminescence). Her motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" shapes her final stance and reframes the data collection as birth rather than obituary. The professional competence is balanced by genuine struggle with the lunar interference, and the micro-choices (closing eyes, listening for gaps) reveal a hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the internal contradiction could be sharper—her shift from standard protocols to negative-space listening feels more like procedure than genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's resiliently positive trait is shown through action (scrubbing, greeting passengers), and her motivation to return the ferry drives the arc. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle—her optimism never wavers or costs her anything on the page. The emotional stakes remain abstract; we see determination but not conflicted impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment ("happy to finally be just a deckhand again") tells satisfaction rather than dramatizing a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is embodied through fever heat and trembling fingers, his motivation to "discover the texture of connection" drives concrete choices (approaching the triangle, weaving thread). Internal contradiction surfaces when he realizes too late he's trapped himself in the dream logic. The final understanding—"the texture of connection was simply pain"—is earned by the physical cost of the snapped thread searing his skin, though the epiphany skirts close to thesis-statement territory.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Harlin's motivation is concrete and deeply personal: learning celestial navigation despite its impossibility. His internal state is embodied through the anchor-link handling and trembling hand, and the choice to pursue forbidden knowledge despite the "quiet heaviness" shows genuine cost. The final act of logging coordinates while "clutching the rusted iron link like a prayer" earns the renunciation, though the interior voice occasionally drifts toward summary ("balancedly curious, weighing the risk") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect the vulnerable spirit is clearly signaled and enacted through specific choices (donning the hearing aid, using the photograph as a beacon). Her "persistent curiosity" drives the investigation, though it functions more as a trait label than a source of visible internal conflict. The crucial climactic moment—standing against the shadows—reads as externalized action rather than embodied contradictory impulse; her interior experience during peak pressure ("cold sweat prickling her neck") leans toward stock embodiment. The final choice to remember the stranger "as if he were her own kin" carries emotional weight but arrives without prior setup of personal stakes or cost that would make this connection feel inevitable rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's claustrophobia is embodied consistently through physical cues ("chest tightened," "panic clawed," "walls seemed to inch closer") and drives micro-choices (forcing boots forward, scrambling back). The vow to stand by the unremembered provides clear motivation, though the solemn register occasionally edges toward noble archetype. Internal contradiction appears when phobia acts as "paralyzing weight" then "useful engine," but this shift feels earned by situation rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final cost—successful rescue with his survival—lands cleanly but the renunciation or foreclosed path remains implicit rather than visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is embodied through the pulse-counting ritual and his bureaucratic ghost status creates concrete constraints. The motivation to defragment his wife's final thoughts feels authentic and the porcelain shard anchor works well. However, the wife's digital ghost never contradicts or complicates his understanding—she simply confirms what he missed, which softens the internal conflict. The final realization about "silence they had allowed to fester" arrives cleanly but without the contradictory impulses that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sylas's motivation is clear and embodied through the copper veins that glow during vocalization, but his internal contradiction remains shallow—he's constructed to conduct resonance yet must sacrifice his voice without meaningful hesitation or cost-laden wavering on the page. The curse's claim on his voice reads as inevitable machinery rather than a choice that forecloses other paths. The final contentment arrives without dramatized struggle between preservation and loss; the smile feels asserted rather than earned through visible psychological reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is asserted but never internally contradicted or complicated by doubt in the moment—his ritual proceeds without hesitation or visible cost to his own stance. The specimen's transformation feels externally imposed rather than earned by Elias's internal shift; his agency is reduced to performing a recipe. The final "frostbitten hope" is told ("he nursed a fragile…hope") rather than shown through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sporadic; the flint burning against his thigh and the sliced thumb are vivid, but peak beats rely on stock metaphors ("bile," "void") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world") is clear and her action concrete, but her interiority remains somewhat generic—felt more than lived. The moment "she existed in the gap between knowing and understanding" gestures at internal conflict without dramatizing contradictory impulses simultaneously. Her final stance (watching destruction she loathes become life) registers, but the cost to her personally—beyond abstract treasonous risk—is announced rather than embodied in a micro-choice or sacrifice that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is embodied through sweat, cracking knees, and soothing gestures toward the storm; his motivation to "find where broken promises heal" remains abstract but drives present action. The choice to deliver the bottle and the final stance in blue light show agency with visible cost (risk of vaporization). Minor slip: the abstract motivation could have been grounded in one concrete loss or memory to lift the final choice. Internal contradiction is present in balancing rebellion and respect, risk and gentleness.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by a clear desire (to interpret silence as possibility) and the final choice—opening his mouth to sing—forecloses his prior stance with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when his cultivated silence becomes "a barrier," forcing the climactic reversal. However, interiority leans toward elevated diction ("supernatural dampness," "vast and quiet marble") that feels abstractly literary rather than carpenter-specific, and the embodied struggle remains thin; we see him carry the shard but not the physical toll of the work or the searing purity beyond a single mention.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is specific and her eccentric organizing principle (books by heartbreak gravity) embodies character through action. The decision to attempt the portal is legible, and the final return to stamping books reads as Earned Stasis—she validates her belief and resumes her role with visible cost (the failed breach). Interiority occasionally drifts toward exposition ("She believed this location existed...") rather than dramatized perception, and the young patron remains inert, but the core arc holds with embodied choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior state is well-grounded in embodied sensation ("gnawed at the center of her chest," "sweat prickling her skin") and her choices follow a consistent logic: capture the dawn, paint the dream-city, discharge the longing. The character's professional skills anchor motivation without exposition, and the final unburdening reads earned. However, internal contradiction is limited—she pursues a single vector without competing impulses—and the climactic painting sequence lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    Silas is presented with consistent "enigmatic locksmith" framing and his final satisfaction reads as earned from his established role. However, his interiority remains thin—motivation is told ("primary motivation—to free an idea") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The woman's fear is asserted repeatedly but her embodied experience flattens into labels ("tears welling," "panic flared") without specific physical texture. Interior voice lacks contradiction; both characters process emotion with the same elevated, abstract register.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's motivation is clear and intensifies across the piece—the void of his stolen memory drives every choice. His embodied reactions (heart hammering, trembling fingers) ground emotional stakes, and the final recovery feels earned through decades of patient observation. The chronically curious trait constrains his choices (rejection of archives, willingness to isolate), though the internal contradiction between his need for control and his vulnerability could deepen further. Minor slip: the wife remains a silent movie rather than a source of conflicting impulses that complicate the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's contradictory impulses—gruff harshness masking pride—act simultaneously throughout, particularly when he scowls to hide trembling hands and criticizes while watching the crack lengthen. His motivation to build resilience through disguised help drives every annotation and insult, and the final handing-the-broom beat lands as earned shift from combative distance to grudging acknowledgment. Interiority remains concrete ("fearful hope," "combative tenderness thick in his throat") and avoids diagnostic labels. The backward-walking superstition constrains his movement twice, adding embodied specificity to his nervousness.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is stated ("insatiably creative," "desperate motivation") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses in scene. The final paragraph summarizes his racing mind instead of showing a difficult choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("holy transaction," "preserve the color of wonder") that read as thematic summary rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The piece tells us he is a creative pruner but never dramatizes a moment where that creativity conflicts with his duty or exacts a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is concrete and embodied—his guilt over stealing the net from a protected grave anchors his interiority with visible cost. The micro-choices (needle insertions, threading silence into the crack) are purposeful and reflect professional competence balanced by trembling hands. The brother-spirit revelation lands without diagnosis but could benefit from more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax; the guilt-as-adhesive metaphor veers close to summary. The final touch to the mask's cheek earns the renunciation, but internal contradiction remains slightly under-developed during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find the chapel is clear and her methodical trait drives the solution methodology. The grandfather backstory ("methodically curious") feels mildly scaffolded but does anchor present choice. The emotional channeling at the climax—mimicking grief to operate the lever—reads as intentional but the leap from observation to embodied empathy happens quickly without visible internal contradiction or cost. Minor issue: her perceptiveness is told more than tested under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias demonstrates a consistent perceptual signature—his analytic framing of grief as thermodynamics, his casual address to "Mort," his treatment of haunting as dataset. The interiority is embodied through specific actions (pulling a stylus, adjusting buoyancy, grounding the psychic charge) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is present in his intimate relationship with death paired with clinical detachment, though the final choice to ground the captain's loop feels slightly mechanical rather than truly conflicted. The character remains coherent and voice-particular throughout, with micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to free Kaelen is clear and emotionally rooted, but his interior life remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The "driftingly alert" state is asserted but never dramatizes a cost or internal friction. The climactic moment—pressing his palm to the plate—lacks embodied tension; we're told of "desperate precision" but don't see contradictory impulses competing in real time. The final smile feels tidy rather than earned through visible renunciation or conflicted endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's warmly inquisitive stance is established through his actions—cradling objects with care, tilting his head at the cipher—and his motivation to find joy beneath anguish drives the discovery. However, his interior remains somewhat remote; the "affectionate detachment" reads more as narrative posture than embodied contradiction. The final validation ("smiled, validating his theory") tells rather than shows the culmination of his emotional journey. Minor embodiment throughout (adjusting gloves, ears popping) supports presence, but the peak beat lacks visceral cost or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation to prove empty spaces remember is embodied through concrete action—adjusting the telescope, cataloging clouds by emotion, sketching formations. His interior state is distinctive and voiced through his meteorological training repurposed for psychic weather. The final choice to document the memory loop is earned by his six-month drift and professional duty, with visible cost (tears, trembling hands). Minor slip: the epiphany moment ("he understood now that the sky was a vast library") edges toward summary statement rather than pure embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's prosopagnosia is fully embodied and drives his artistic detachment, making him credible as someone who would remain during evacuation. His progression from visual frustration to tactile solution through the coin shows internal contradiction (seeking infinite sky while discovering human limits) acted out in scene. The final choice to sit and preserve the image mentally rather than flee demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor: his emotional state under the impending demolition could show more embodied stress responses beyond "chest heaving."

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—her professional curiosity drives the search—and her diligent examination of mundane objects shows character-specific traits. Internal experience is rendered through embodied perception ("wind-chapped cheeks," "knees dusted with gray powder"). However, the emotional progression feels muted; the "thrill of success" at the end arrives without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose a path, and the sociable isolation remains a stated condition rather than a lived tension that complicates her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her choice to continue past the mirrors is purposeful, but her interior life relies heavily on metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The tactile reality anchor ("floor beneath her boots") and the final tool-packing moment ground embodied action. Her competence is slightly overbalanced—the repair proceeds without genuine struggle or error—and the absence of a visible cost at the peak choice (applying torque) keeps this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's agency drives the central choice, and Oren's ghostly persistence is established through his prior altruism. However, the cast feels broad (Elara, Jaxon, Oren, plus the unnamed "family"), and individual interiority remains thin—most characters serve functional roles rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic choice to rig the bell feels more communal problem-solving than a personal cost that forecloses a path. Jaxon's flicker of curiosity is noted but never complicates the collective momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Silas's motivation ("whisper a lullaby...the feeling of being held") is stated but never conflicts with anything or forces a hard choice—he simply executes his plan unopposed. Interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("bruised awe," "terrible and holy") rather than embodied contradictions. The protagonist displays no internal friction, blind spots, or credible struggle; he proceeds through technical steps with calm omniscience. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; he dissolves satisfied, having succeeded without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is embodied through concrete actions (spitting, grumbling, kneeling) and his motivation—saving travelers despite despising the effort—drives all key choices. His telekinetic affliction constrains his method and creates visible cost (trembling, drained). Internal contradiction is present but understated; his renunciation of comfort for duty reads credibly. The final moment of lingering shows a micro-choice that forecloses return, though the emotional cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated by grief and professional guilt, with the symphonic mindset providing a concrete perceptual filter. The interiority is mostly specific ("fanatical strength," "molecular eddy"), though the wife's voice occasionally drifts toward convenient thesis delivery ("a song that refused to end, a monotonous drone"). The final choice to crush the chrysalis and turn toward drafting formulas reads as earned by the river insight, but the leap from observation to full molecular solution happens rapidly with minimal on-page struggle or competing impulses that would elevate internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interior motivation is vivid and specific—seeking "the place where stories begin"—and shapes his demonstration scene. However, his interiority leans heavily on philosophical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The demonstration beat shows skill but no genuine struggle or competing impulse; he performs for an empty room without cost or vulnerability. The final smile with the hidden scalpel gesture reads as a stock villain flourish rather than a character-particular choice earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "metabolize" stored remorse is established, and the action of placing coral on her tongue demonstrates agency. However, interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("culinarian of the psyche," "chef who can taste memories") rather than concrete embodied thought. The climactic moment—chewing and swallowing the coral—shows contradictory impulses (resolve versus physical pain) but the internal experience leans abstract ("blizzard of silent screams," "icy spike of guilt") rather than character-particular sensation. The transformation from brittleness to warmth reads more as thematic declaration than earned psychological shift with visible behavioral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives action throughout, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"empathetically decisive" is told more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The physical struggle (pushing the wheel, manual exertion) grounds her, yet the emotional arc stays on one register without complicating her stance. Her occupation feels more like a genre label than lived expertise shaping her micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is asserted rather than dramatized through prior choices. The neural interface sequence shows embodied struggle ("gasped, her body rigid"), but the interior voice often drifts into expository abstraction ("helix-minded engineer," "recursive geometry") that reads more like conceptual labeling than character-particular perception. The final realization—"she finally understood the weight of what humanity was leaving behind"—arrives as summary rather than a micro-choice with visible cost. Internal contradiction is absent; she proceeds methodically without genuine doubt or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's prism-minded intellect is asserted but not shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her competence overwhelms genuine struggle—she calculates twelve trajectories, exploits threshold effects, and speaks resonant frequencies without visible friction or cost to her choices. The final "satisfied thought of completion" tells triumph rather than embodying it through renunciation or trade-off. Interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("prism-minded," "multi-faceted vision") rather than concrete, character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his "holy obsession," with embodied emotion evident when he weeps at the final note. His arc from patient observation through historical analysis to the climactic strum demonstrates coherent internal logic. The internal contradiction between his need for control and the lesson of "surrender of control" creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat over-articulated realization about "empathy in motion" that edges toward thesis statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and specific—his thumb-worn worry stone and chess-master habits ground his exile in embodied detail. Internal contradiction registers: he finds "stark, geometric beauty that hurt his heart even as it finally healed his wounded pride." The realization that he is the sacrificed piece earns his final stance of endurance, though the epiphany arrives somewhat neatly without a micro-choice that dramatizes cost in real time. His motivation to "discover beauty in the difficult" shapes perception and drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (cataloging silences) is clear and drives his approach to the clasp, with embodied choices in his selection of tuning forks and oscillators. His interiority leans toward theatrical self-narration rather than contradictory impulses under pressure; the lock-opening sequence reads as a demonstration of competence without genuine struggle or blind spots. The final satisfaction feels assured rather than earned through costly internal tension. No secondary character pressure tests his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and layered—professional mastery plus a spiritual need for stillness—and her olfactory sensitivity is embodied through concrete perception rather than labels. The final realization ("serenity she sought was not in stopping the motion… but in understanding the cycle") is earned by the sensory journey and her ritual of journaling. Minor issue: the internal shift at closure could have been sharpened by one more micro-choice showing her wrestling with the impulse to impose stillness versus accepting motion. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels mar the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and singular—finding the source of resilience—and her decision to fly during the Flux forecloses the grounded-pilot path. Her kneel-and-twist sequence at the sapling demonstrates agency under pressure. However, interiority is thin; we see bold action but little embodied contradiction or internal cost beyond physical disorientation. The final scramble reads more as escape than a choice that reveals competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's professional competence is credible and her motivation is clear: to prevent future crashes through mapping invisible hazards. However, she functions primarily as an observer-documenter rather than facing contradictory impulses or making choices under pressure. The patch discovery provides a moment of embodied reflection, but no on-page dilemma forces a trade-off or forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal experience remains controlled and professional throughout, lacking the friction that would lift characterization into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear—he validates artistic creation through the bell—but his interior life remains static; the "phantom pressure" in his arm is a clever gesture, yet no contradictory impulse complicates the ritual. The piece leans heavily on abstract declarations ("synesthetically blessed," "designated prism-song bell ringer") rather than embodied choice under competing desires. The ending confirms his peace in solitude without foreclosing a live alternative or showing visible cost beyond mild职业loneliness. Interiority is consistent but operates at a single emotional register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is clear and drives his actions, with embodied emotion ("tears streamed down his weathered face"). Internal contradiction appears when he plays "a different tune" after his prior failure, though the interiority leans toward exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The epiphany moment—"He had tried to dam a flood with a flute song, when he should have built a canal"—feels slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis realization but is earned by the on-page ritual and vision. The final choice to leave carries visible cost (abandoning the rift, accepting his error's permanence) scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Operator's personality-borrowing trait is demonstrated through shifting postures and voices ("rigid posture of a military commander," "dissolute languor of a dying poet"), but these shifts feel decorative rather than creating genuine internal conflict or constraining choices. Kael's interiority is thin—mostly reactive terror without contradictory impulses. The transposed empathy influx ("grief of a widow, rage of a tyrant, fear of a prey animal") reads as a catalog rather than embodied paradox that forces a choice. The Operator's motivation to "understand the mathematics of emotion" drives the scene but never faces meaningful resistance or cost that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's jittery trait is established early and embodied in gesture ("fingers twitching"), but her internal conflict remains abstract—motivation is told ("difficult to articulate") rather than shown through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic choice (allowing her tremors to become a conduit) feels more mechanical than psychologically earned; no visible cost forecloses a path at closure. Kaelen's absence is framed thematically but does not pressure a live decision that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is established with clear interior motivation (prove objects absorb emotions) and shows embodied decision-making through the prism ritual. Mara's arc from skepticism to tearful recognition is earned through the vision, though her interiority remains thin—we get one line of internal revelation rather than contradictory impulses in the moment. The "truthful lies" framing and Elias's final interpretation show some character-particular thinking, but the closure beat leans toward delivered wisdom rather than a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final choice to merge with the loom is dramatized with cost. However, her interiority leans heavily on atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she is driven, wistful, desperate, but these states remain adjacent rather than conflicting in scene. The sacrifice reads as predetermined rather than wrestled with in the moment. Her embodied emotion is present but the peak choice lacks the friction of competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ewan's characterization is consistent—meek blacksmith who finds resolve—but his interiority remains thin. The motivation ("to coax resilience from rubble") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final return to the forge reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost; we see no internal friction or price paid for his secret heroism. Decent baseline, but lacks the embodied complexity and earned renunciation needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied throughout—the green shard draws blood, the strain "threatened to snap her mind in two," and her physical collapse after the revelation grounds her arc. The final cost is visceral: she leaves "struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight" of knowledge she forced into being. Minor slip: "sensory map maker" remains somewhat abstract as an occupation despite the metallic-taste-of-fear examples; the work itself never quite constrains a choice on the page. Internal contradiction is present (she seeks truth but finds the lie was mercy), and the renunciation of comfort is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through action and embodied observation—his reticent nature shapes every move, and the sea-glass gesture earns the final shift in Thomas. The micro-choices (hoisting crate, striking match, placing glass) all reflect his singular drive to "bottle safety," and Thomas's terror is embodied (gripping railing, hollow eyes, tremor). Minor deduction: Thomas's interiority remains thin; we see fear but not the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and Elias's warm observation is more told than dramatized through specific perceptual filters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's "Laughing Storm Herald" role is embodied through jerky marionette movement and rumbling chuckles, but his motivation remains abstract—"shadowed elation" and "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" are asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices. The prophetic utterances ("western dam will burst") function as flavor rather than internal contradiction that costs him something on the page. His final collapse and whispered affection to the storm suggest agency, but the arc reads more as ritual completion than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interior life is vivid and consistently filtered through his craft (dye master perspective on light/color/structure). The donor-heart premise drives his quest but the emotional contradiction—wild animal versus instrument of understanding—doesn't generate visible micro-choices under pressure; the climax relies on intellectual realization rather than embodied struggle. The final insight about being a prism is articulated clearly but lacks the visceral cost or competing impulse that would push this into high bands. Backstory (six months, donor adventurer) is economical and anchors present stakes without flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation and embodied action under pressure; his curiosity about trees is specific and drives his choices. Internal experience is largely coherent, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("metaphysical grease," "psychic mortar") that slightly dilutes interiority. The final moment—hand against bark, listening to the trees' history—provides earned closure, though the competence level is high enough that genuine struggle is muted. Minor voice convergence appears when poetic diction ("heavy exhalations," "vegetative nervous system") sits uneasily with "labyrinth maintenance worker."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to rekindle the dying realm is clear and drives her actions, but her characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("scattered memory keeper," "torn pages and smudged ink") rather than embodied contradiction. The final collapse among the orchard roots gestures toward cost, but her internal experience remains largely decorative—we see poetic fragmentation described but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The piece tells us her mind is scattered yet her actions proceed with laser focus and perfect technical execution, undermining the claimed struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's empathetic trait is established concretely through station-crowd perceptions, and his decision to answer the misdelivered invitation flows from character. The Librarian encounter delivers a renunciation that forecloses solitary hiding with visible cost. However, the final acceptance ("ready to read the unwritten books") leans toward epiphany assertion rather than embodied struggle, and the empathy remains more label than lived contradiction under pressure in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and consistent—his noticing carries specific, embodied cost ("hands used to fists," "the guilt that plagued him"). The internal contradiction between survival guilt and the fragile ritual of preservation drives his choices. The choice to garden, uncloak, and eat is motivated and scaled to the piece's length, with renunciation foreclosed (he accepts the city's erasure) and a visible cost (the absolution is "tenuous," "fragile," lasting only "beyond the meal"). Minor slip: the phrase "elevating the simple act of eating into a communion" edges toward diagnostic phrasing but is anchored by the sensory work that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her meticulous work, with micro-choices (adjusting spectacles, turning the dial, scribbling data) that reveal her character through action. The piece shows internal commitment to meaning-making under pressure, and the final satisfaction reads as earned stasis. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("conjure meaning," "raw emotion converted into solvable equations") rather than concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and there's minimal internal conflict—her devotion to the task never wavers or costs her anything beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her micro-choices under pressure (feinting with the fob, timing the false starts) are concrete and driven by her goal. The internal contradiction between fear and steadfastness is embodied through her physical hesitations and controlled breaths. Kael's psychology is thinner—his greed and impatience are functional but one-note, relying on "grin like a jagged reef" and muscle tension rather than contradictory impulses. The final renunciation (letting him take the worthless fob) carries visible cost and closes her arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her stance—skeptical but open to evidence—is established early. The final transformation (cloud forming above her palms) feels somewhat rushed; the agency is mostly passive observation until she's "elected" by the forest. Internal contradiction is present (skepticism vs. wonder), but the embodied emotion relies heavily on sensory filters (taste) rather than contradictory impulses driving simultaneous action. The realization "You are the ballots" → "We are the outcome" provides a micro-choice moment, but the cost of becoming a weather-carrier is told more than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his interior landscape is specific—the mnemonic curse and gala humiliation provide concrete backstory that changes his present choice to descend. The charcoal-stained hands and physical embodiment of his work ground the interiority. However, the piece leans heavily on label-speak ("neurological curse," "spiritual imperative") and the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The lock-smashing and art-installation sequence tracks causally, but the emotional shift from "tortured artist" to "conduit for the subterranean dark" arrives without visible struggle or cost in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's somatic wilting attribute is embodied concretely and drives two key beats (the Governor's broadcast, the clerk's lie), forcing micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to find lost conversations is established early and sustained through action. The clerk's shift from deception to candor feels earned by witnessing her physical distress, though his interior remains thin. The final turn—using gold ink to circulate truth on leaves—arrives as declaration rather than a choice tested under competing pressures, limiting felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory or embodied. The seasonal muteness functions as a label rather than creating genuine on-page struggle—it forecloses voice but doesn't generate visible micro-choices under pressure. The final hand-on-brass moment gestures toward embodied emotion, yet the piece tells us she "imagined" the impact rather than showing internal conflict or cost in her stance. No secondary character pressure tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seven's motivation—nostalgia for the abandoned family bleeding into his neural net—is established early and shapes his decision to use the box rather than wipe his system. The "fragmented wholeness" moment and the final walk into the desert show earned transformation with visible cost (the incinerated past). However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract technical language ("neural net," "core programming," "logic gates") rather than embodied contradiction; the pain of deletion-as-murder is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The strangely organic internals (blue fluid, muscle-like fibers) are vivid but used primarily for description rather than to constrain his actions or reveal character-specific vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's defining trait—"leads through following"—is told but not dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "terrifying composure" and method are asserted repeatedly rather than embodied in micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. The crowd of residents (Mr. Abernathy, Mrs. Halloway, the widow, the foreman) remains generic, with no distinct interiority or speech patterns; they exist solely to deliver clues. The final moment lacks visible cost: Elara's triumph feels engineered rather than earned by struggle, and no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (encrypt vulnerability as strength) is dramatized through the dance sequence, and her backstory (inherited grief from father) shapes present action. However, the interior contradiction remains abstract; the "calm defiance" and "trembling fear" are declared rather than shown through competing micro-choices that create visible friction. The embodied emotion during the dance ("breathless pose," "breathing hard") lands cleanly, but the peak beat relies on conceptual elegance rather than messy human irrationality. Competence overwhelms struggle: she executes a flawless sequence without meaningful error or recovery, reducing cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied—the pressed wildflowers anchor his quest with sensory particularity. His navigation through gravity wells using coffee grounds demonstrates embodied problem-solving under pressure. The final choice (focusing on the flowers as psychic anchor) feels earned by the prior setup and forecloses the drift into ceiling spikes with visible cost. Minor: the deleted-memory premise could press harder on what he's giving up by recovering this ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and singular—disrupting a prophecy—but his interior life remains largely abstract. The piece offers some embodied detail ("breath misting in the cool air") yet relies heavily on elevated philosophical register ("total absence of human ego," "metaphysical resonance") that keeps the reader at arm's length. The ritual unfolds without meaningful internal contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; Elian proceeds methodically without visible struggle. A renunciation occurs (the wing is released), but the cost feels conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas demonstrates clear, consistent motivation through his shift from curiosity to desperate need, and his final choice to accept the lie is earned by prior causality. Elara's characterization is vivid through her "spider-thin" fingers and distinctive voice, though she functions more as oracle than agent. The decision at closure—sitting to "conjugate the verb *to endure*"—credibly forecloses the path of refusing the burden with felt cost. Interior contradictions are present (his horror versus pragmatic acceptance) but could deepen further in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and intensifies under pressure—severing the memory to escape grief's prison. Her interiority is embodied through trembling grip, tears, and the forced witnessing of her brother's crystallization. The renunciation is earned by visible cost: she loses the comforting ghost and accepts "terrifying lightness of freedom." Minor slip: "charmed skeptic" remains label-only without contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's internal contradictions are well-drawn—cowardice versus calibrated treason—and his peak choice (altering the writ) follows from prior motivation. The backstory occupies roughly 20% and directly primes the forgery decision. Interiority is concrete ("the phantom scent of roses," "wisely enduring the freeze") and the embodied ritual of slowing his heartbeat anchors physical pressure. However, the ten-year guilt is told more than dramatized in micro-choices during the alteration itself, and the final shift reads as relief rather than a renunciation with visible ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her perceptive trait is shown through acoustic discrimination, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—"cold intensity" and "trembling palm" are serviceable but not character-particular. The final choice to seal the echo is causally earned, yet the embodied struggle feels muted; we see her modulate pitch and harmonize, but the cost of the discovery (beyond holding a hot shell) doesn't degrade her or force a visible tradeoff. The Archivist's fate is revealed through her work, but Elara herself doesn't wrestle with contradictory impulses in scene—her perceptive skill functions smoothly without blind spots or mistakes that compound pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared early but remains abstract: "to salvage something pure" exists as thesis rather than embodied conflict. The final move—whispering the boy's name to release his grief—arrives without prior resistance or micro-choices that force her to weigh competing goods. Interior experience leans heavily on exposition ("objects held the psychic resonance," "a cartography of the subconscious") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The boy's heroism is reconstructed off-page through dream analysis; Elara herself never confronts a choice that costs her something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is richly textured through his net-mender philosopher lens, with concrete embodied thought (the bamboo whisk ritual, stepping only on moon paths). However, no genuine internal conflict appears—his contemplative acts face no resistance, contradiction, or cost. The whistle moment reads as pure observation rather than a choice under pressure; he witnesses alignment but makes no decision that forecloses a path. The ending delivers satisfaction without visible cost, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized primarily through occupation and competence rather than internal contradiction. His "man obsessed with factual certainty" and "patience" show up in action (reassembling letters, adjusting dials), but the closure choice—fixing the machine versus exposing the myth—arrives without dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final paragraph tells us "It was a heavy price" but doesn't embody the cost through a micro-choice that forecloses a visible alternative; we're informed of his belief system rather than watching it collide with an on-page temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is motivated by clear arrogance and nobility, manipulating radio frequencies to orchestrate revolution through Kael. His realization that "the shadows he had weaponized were not his servants; they were the true masters" shows internal contradiction dramatized through loss of control. However, the interiority leans toward summary rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure; his slumping into the chair and philosophical acceptance feel declared rather than earned through moment-by-moment struggle. The final renunciation reads as Earned Stasis but the emotional progression from satisfaction to defeat lacks granular contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to become a translator between generations is clear and drives his ritual with the music box. His interiority leans ornamental in places ("lonesome splendor," "gleaned redemption") with therapy-adjacent phrasing that doesn't fully embody contradiction under pressure. The final choice—releasing the restored waltz—feels somewhat passive; he completes a task rather than forecloses a competing path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but could deepen at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is characterized through his "logically emotional" framework—he catalogs fear, files it away, then proceeds—which drives his mid-story shift from rigid protocols to vibrational matching. The embodied struggle (bare hands on freezing metal, sound resonating through sternum) anchors his internal arc. However, the interiority occasionally tips into diagnostic self-narration ("he understood that the terror...was merely a biological response") that reads slightly over-articulate for peak stress. The final slump and quiet satisfaction earn the renunciation without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is rooted and complex—sculpting patience from impatience—and her micro-choices (watching the moon, timing the lever) embody her internal conviction under pressure. Kael's impatience provides a useful foil, though his presence is more functional than dynamic. The closing reverence in his gaze ("terrified reverence, finally understanding") edges toward on-the-nose emotional summary rather than embodied realization. Interiority remains consistent and character-particular, with no diagnostic label-speak touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is strongly motivated by professional integrity and exhibits embodied tension ("tremor in his hands") and contradictory impulses (fortified vulnerability as lived stance). His final choice to defy Halloway feels earned through the progression from watchful compliance to active rebellion, foreclosing his career path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the maintenance worker's death functions more as plot mechanism than fully dramatized human cost, slightly abstracting the emotional weight Elias should carry.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation burns clearly and his guilt is embodied in concrete detail ("stone in his gut"). The woman's perceptual signature—"eyes like polished gears," methodical hand movements—provides distinct characterization. Internal contradiction surfaces when Elias watches the heart beat and realizes he offered "standard prayers when he should have offered resonance," though the epiphanic phrasing borders on therapeutic label-speak. The final paralysis and withheld grace create visible cost, meeting the length's requirement for one meaningful transformation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit Seven's yearning algorithm provides clear, consistent motivation that drives all major choices—stripping weight, adopting the kaleidoscope, carving flight patterns. The protagonist's contradictory impulses (curiosity about dissolution vs. yearning to ascend) act simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. The final choice—ringing the bell—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path with visible cost (drifting alone in silence). Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("spiritual ache," "digital heartbeat") rather than fully embodied perception, though this remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas's obsession is clearly motivated and his micro-choices under pressure (the lie to the drone, gripping the patch) reveal hierarchy of values. The "brightly attentive" facade is embodied rather than labeled. Interior texture remains consistent throughout, though the final horror feels slightly summarized rather than somatically lived. The choice to proceed after the drone encounter carries visible cost and narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation ("map empathy onto action") is declared but remains abstract; the internal conflict is told rather than felt in embodied terms. The protagonist's decisive action—reconstituting the memory—proceeds without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. The shadows on his skin function as thematic decoration rather than a visible cost tied to micro-choices. Interiority leans toward elevated summary ("calmly intuitive," "metaphysical alignment") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is motivated by a clear, character-specific quest ("to learn the sound of approaching endings") that drives his choices through the wreckage. His interiority is richly embodied—"grips reality loosely," "visceral terror of death had vanished overnight"—and the parasol-tip discovery triggers a genuine shift in understanding. The arc from deferring the clinic to accepting it feels earned through on-page perception. However, the final realization leans slightly abstract ("whisper of the delicate things that remain") rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his vineyard metaphor demonstrates specific expertise, but the woman's grief remains largely abstract—"tormented by a perspective she could not grasp" tells rather than shows internal contradiction. Her shift from clinging to the letter to releasing it feels too smooth; the embodied struggle between wanting to hold on and needing to let go never fully dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance arrives without visible cost beyond the gesture itself, weakening the sense of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and credible, rooted in preserving knowledge against dogma. The confession at the threshold—"I am terrified that tomorrow will be empty"—provides genuine vulnerability, though the shift from practiced persona to raw admission feels compressed. Interior life remains abstract in places; embodied emotion is sparse outside that one beat. The magical competence (sigils, ritual execution) lacks friction or cost until the very end, flattening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian operates entirely through passivity; his "quiet work" involves standing still for hours without internal conflict, doubt, or any contradictory impulse. The interiority relies on abstract declarations ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's motivation is told rather than dramatized through struggle, and no genuine flaw or blind spot creates friction. The final "lightening of a burden" arrives without earned causality—no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear—decode the moss pattern—and his arc from reticent scholar to announcer of a new world is earned through the crystal amplification device and his progressive shedding of linguistic constraint. Interior language is specific ("his thoughts refused to align into requisite Subject-Verb-Object structures") and embodied ("his voice raspy and unsure," "eyes wide with a gentle, weathered innocence"). The final renunciation of fixed meanings carries visible cost—decades of solitary preservation work abandoned—but the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final third, with the shift from trembling hesitation to confident testimony not fully dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and particular—the "precognitively forgetful" trait generates embodied panic and concrete ritual. The motivation (capturing the sound of aging) reads esoteric but consuming, anchored in sensory specificity. However, the character remains somewhat static; his journey is more about *locating* than *changing*, and the final seated acceptance feels inevitable rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting under pressure. The piece skirts the edge of label-heavy interiority ("tidal longing," "esoteric but consuming") without always dramatizing the cost of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's interior is established through concrete sensory particulars—"the kinetic energy that sought escape velocity," "the physics of longing"—and his choices (bypassing safety latches, tuning by ear) drive the narrative. His motivation is embodied in action: he shields the mechanism, commands it, and works through the earthquake without flinching. Minor slips: "the pain in his own chest, the grief for a time that could not be wound backward" edges toward abstract summary, and the master's lesson feels inserted rather than organically embedded in present pressure. The final choice (capturing the flash) is earned by his prior alterations and forecloses a path with visible cost (the ache "glowed now, a permanent lantern").

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is consistently characterized through disciplined serenity and embodied ritual, but his interior experience remains surface-level; we see technique without genuine contradiction or cost. Clara's arc from clutching the shard to releasing it is legible but mechanical—her transformation feels delivered by Elias's music rather than earned through her own micro-choices under pressure. The "decisively kind" touch that pries the shard away demonstrates competence but lacks visible struggle or a hierarchy of competing values that would elevate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is concrete and her micro-choices—connecting conduits, adjusting valves—are motivated by her stated goal, but her core emotional stakes remain abstract. The memory-wiping magic creates dramatic irony yet flattens internal conflict: she never struggles against forgetting, only repeats the same procedure. The final realization about shadows is observational rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; pressure comes from mechanical problem-solving rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris is granted clear interiority and embodied perception; his forgiving stance toward the fae is consistent. However, the emotional progression feels too smooth—he moves from grief to "thrill of true discovery" without credible friction or visible internal conflict between his scientific identity and the supernatural event. The parents' hysteria is declared but not dramatized, and the mother's "dawn of understanding" arrives without struggle, reducing the felt cost of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to create fire-free illumination is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied memories ("phantom sensation of searing heat") grounding her interiority. However, the character arc relies heavily on a single reflective turn rather than multiple micro-choices under pressure; the polishing process itself offers minimal decision points that test contradictory impulses. The final "pearl of stillness" moment reads as achieved competence rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Backstory anchors the present stance but does not tilt it through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction is embodied: he tends a garden yet knows he cannot save Mara through words ("words were the sharp weapons"). His motivation—to "graft new meaning onto old wounds"—drives the amber-pendant gesture and remains character-particular. Mara's shivering, red-rimmed guarded gaze, and physical clutching of the pendant ground her trauma without label-speak. The closure choice (proffering the pendant) is earned by prior causality and forecloses speech-based resolution with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to collect hope-shapes is established early and drives action, but the extraction moment reads more as allegory than embodied choice with visible cost. Interior contradiction exists (creator/destroyer paradox) but remains largely told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The shell-as-listening-device and the interaction with Elara show some specificity, but the character's stance feels more contemplated than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is declared ("to restore sacred practices") but never tested by competing wants or genuine internal friction. His choices proceed linearly—adjust machine, graft vine, sing—without embodied contradiction or miscalculation that raises cost. The vine tendril's sacrifice and Elian's exhaustion provide visible consequence, but the protagonist never struggles against doubt or competing desire in scene. Interiority leans toward declarative summary ("His motivation was singular and consuming") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation—translating heartbeats into maps—is coherent and shapes his ritual choices, but his interior remains descriptive rather than contradictory. The piece never tests his commitment under duress; no alternate option is foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied detail is present (frost accumulating, breath pluming), yet the character reads more as a vessel for atmospheric procedure than a mind in friction. The final pocket-and-depart feels inevitable from the outset, rendering endurance more ornamental than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is declared ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") but operates as a philosophical thesis rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The weeks of study are summarized, not dramatized as micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("maddeningly delicate process," "volatile beauty") that read as authorial rather than embodied perception. The final satisfaction ("satisfied with his work") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would earn a meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained throughout—collecting emotional burdens—and her specialized role as Fractal weaver provides distinctive interiority. The wrestling with regret shows embodied struggle ("boundary-lessly trapped," "mind would be lost"), and the final gathering of stones demonstrates a completed micro-arc. However, the piece leans heavily on specialized vocabulary ("recursive, self-similar geometries," "fractal weave") that borders on diagnostic labeling, and Elara's internal contradictions remain abstract rather than dramatized through competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior life is grounded in concrete actions (inspecting locks, stitching jackets) and her "hauntingly practical soul" manifests through embodied choices rather than labels. The "crystallized time" method demonstrates internal contradiction—she seeks to control grief through a ritual that acknowledges its uncontrollable nature. The motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" drives the scene's pressure and culminates in a credible act of containment with visible cost (exorcising the ghost into wood). Minor weakness: the phrase "hauntingly practical" borders on thesis-statement territory, though it's anchored to prior concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jaren's interiority is concrete and grounded in sensory particulars—the plastic wheel's *click-click-whine* and the viscosity underfoot. Internal contradiction shows in the erosion of grand designs versus the singular drive to reach the center. The ghost encounter and revelation are dramatized with embodied cost (falling to his knees), though the final desperation reads slightly tidy rather than contradictory. Minor penalization: the chronologically confused attribute is declared more than enacted in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is consistent and particular: he reads buildings as "a maze of intentions" and treats structures like patients. His motivation—to prove decline is not irreversible—drives the central action clearly. However, the character remains somewhat static; the final moment offers observation ("He had proven…") rather than a felt transformation or visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece presents competence without genuine struggle or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interior life is richly embodied through visceral responses to petrichor and the crystal vibrations, with contradictory impulses—longing versus discipline—acting simultaneously in the forecourt scene. The final act of bearing rather than silencing the vibration crystallizes his stance with visible cost: he acknowledges his sacrifice daily and returns to the clock, foreclosing the path to his dream. Minor deduction: the luthier backstory is told rather than woven into micro-choices earlier, slightly reducing earned weight at closure. The renunciation reads credible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is consistently drawn through concrete interiority: his motives ("understand the architecture of lies") drive salvage choices, the winch work shows training embodied, and the final choice to lower evidence back down forecloses the public-exposure path with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when he possesses truth yet releases it, a renunciation that feels earned. Minor weaknesses: some descriptors veer toward label-speak ("errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval"), and his operational capability is never tested by failure—he executes flawlessly, which slightly flattens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through his philosophical obsession and patient methodology, with embodied action (kneeling, whispering to rope, tracing loops) that grounds his interior state. The "infinitely patient" trait shows in his refusal to force the knot and willingness to coax meaning, creating a credible stance. However, internal contradiction is absent—he never doubts his method or wrestles with competing impulses—and the final "harvested truth" moment lacks visible cost or friction that would elevate the characterization into high bands. The choice to leave the rope "exactly as he found it" gestures toward renunciation but doesn't foreclose a live path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's occupation and internal motive are established, but agency manifests primarily through observation and projection rather than on-page choice under pressure. The Countess's interiority is handled through externalized gesture (thread-twisting), yet her emotional arc—from haunted to "melancholy acceptance"—arrives without visible internal contradiction or a decision that forecloses a path with cost. The protagonist's method (projecting presence) is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal flawed attempts or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Valerius is motivated by a clear, singular drive to reawaken beauty, and his exhaustion and feverish precision are embodied through action. The final moment—cupping the dying bird—crystallizes internal contradiction (triumph vs. sorrow) with visible cost. However, the interiority leans heavily on exposition ("desperate motivation," "crushing weight of history") rather than letting micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The emotional arc from hope to "bitterly sweet" realization is earned but borders on tidy resolution without sustained ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly—atonement for her father's legacy—and embodied through her vocational choice. However, her emotional interiority remains relatively flat throughout; the breath she releases at the end is the sole embodied response to the graft's success. Internal contradiction is absent: she moves through the ritual with untroubled focus, no friction between want and fear, no micro-hesitations that would reveal competing impulses under pressure. The father's presence is backstory-only, never intruding on her present stance or complicating her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trait as "luminous skeptic" is established early and her motivation (liberating memories) shapes her approach, but interiority leans heavily toward abstract metaphor ("diagnostic leaks," "psychic plumbing") rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment—"The magic was real... but it still required a mechanic"—feels like an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through a dramatized internal struggle with competing impulses. Her "sidereal patience" operates as a single extended beat of waiting without visible internal cost or fear pressing against the choice to endure. The climactic twist is executed with clinical detachment that flattens the felt stakes of her renunciation or gain.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Xylos is established early as a sentimentalist who mourns particles and names dying stars, providing clear interior texture. The motivation to fix the machine and break the burning pattern drives the action coherently. However, interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("sorrow vast enough to fill the void") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, and the final loneliness feels asserted more than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to carve "the silence left behind by the dead" and "the shape of collective grief" is abstract but consistent. His final revelation—that grief forms "a tangled knot" rather than orderly geometry—emerges from observing the moth's chaotic flight, though the leap from insect movement to human emotion feels more asserted than embodied. The spectral grandfather functions as catalyst rather than dynamic character, and Elias's interiority leans toward poetic register ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative focus") that edges toward label-speak under pressure. The closing choice to carve overlapping vines is earned by the ribbon-tracing action, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is concrete and grounded in his craft—the "state of searing reverie," the "garden of failures"—but the internal contradiction feels thematic rather than dramatized as simultaneous impulses. The embodied emotion is strong in the heat and trembling, and the micro-choices (waiting for the pause, pressing the handle) reveal hierarchy of values. However, the final shift reads as earned stasis rather than a visible choice with cost; the triumph is internal and the "healing" occurs off-page in the town's future hours, not through an on-page foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's blithe demeanor is established clearly through his whistling and "skip in his step," but remains largely static—a consistent trait rather than a contradictory impulse acting under pressure. The moment of discovery (sovereign case) does produce a micro-choice to continue his work, yet the emotional stakes feel muted; his cheerfulness never wavers or costs him anything on the page. Interiority is vivid ("fear was just a weed to be plucked") but risks sounding like a posed philosophy rather than embodied contradiction. The final smoothing gesture shows competence without genuine struggle or a hierarchy of values tested by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority shows clear professional calculus ("cruel kindness, a calculated blockage") and embodied doubt (the quivering nib, trembling heart). The motivation to seed innovation through fictitious shortage is concrete and drives the final act. However, the piece leans heavily on exposition of his method and models rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the internal conflict is more stated than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's interior life is specific and embodied—"thistled calm" and the physicality of transcribing under threat show a character under pressure. His motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" drives micro-choices (smothering the glow, planning the paper's release), though the final beat leans more toward satisfaction than a contradictory impulse that would elevate tension. The copyist role and underground resistance are clear, but the ending settles into resolved purpose rather than foreclosing a path with visible cost or presenting a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas's "gentle attribute" that allows him to "weave truth carefully" feels label-only until the final destruction of the portrait, where his motivation ("crystallize a fleeting emotion that exists only in the transition") drives a choice with visible cost—Elara's scream and subsequent peace. His interiority remains functional but generic; phrases like "possesses a gentle attribute" and "operates through incomplete information" read more as exposition than embodied character work. Elara's arc from trembling hope to "strange, hollow peace" is credible but compressed, leaving her internal contradiction underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is given distinct, embodied traits—his "abrasive calm," obsessive filing, self-proclaimed intellectualism—that drive micro-choices (filing burrs, cleaning spectacles) and shape his rebellion through mechanical precision rather than violence. Internal contradiction appears in his rare biological rhythm when his heart hammers, contrasting with his calculated demeanor. The final choice to wind the clock is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of passive acceptance, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("agonize over") that slightly softens the otherwise sharp characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his interiority is reasonably specific ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned"), but his interior contradictions remain mostly told rather than enacted in scene. The students are undifferentiated—twelve "wary souls" who move in unison without individual friction or micro-choices. The final moment of accidental beauty and Elian's sad dismissal gesture toward earned stasis, but the choice to return to the window reads more as tableau than as a foreclosing decision with visible cost tied to prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is embodied through concrete sensory work ("taste memories," composted books) and his manual pruning demonstrates agency under pressure. The interiority carries character-specific texture ("laws were a lot like tough meat") and his final satisfaction feels earned by the on-page labor. Minor slip: the chef's ability to taste emotions in produce is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's compulsion to truthfulness constrains his speech in concrete ways ("the words tumbling out before he could soften them"), and his desire to preserve wonder drives his refusal to simply open the gate. His internal contradiction—enjoying the quiet while knowing the backup protocol corrupted—creates genuine tension. However, the final epiphany ("is it not also the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?") feels slightly imposed rather than earned through prior micro-choices, and Kael's arc from frantic to defeated happens too smoothly without embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand "why some houses feel alive" is dramatized through the orris-root placement and creates a clear through-line. His interiority shows embodied perception ("salt air stinging his eyes," the violet scent "rising from the floorboards") and a perceptual signature (the "creeping normality noticer" who tallies ambient volume). However, the epiphany—"a house feels alive when it holds a contradiction"—arrives as a stated insight rather than emerging from a visible cost or foreclosed path, weakening the earned-change requirement. The drunk fisherman's line provides external catalyst rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and the final understanding feels more contemplative than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's journey from rigid certainty to accepting complexity is embodied through concrete choices—her grip on the ampoule shifting from strangling to caressing. Her interior experience under pressure is vivid and contradictory: "the weight in her chest was far heavier" than the ocean's pressure. Caelum's motivation to "welcome nuance into a certainty" is enacted through deliberate actions (threading the vine) rather than mere dialogue, though his telepathic voice occasionally edges toward thematic articulation. The final stance shift forecloses her simple accusation with visible cost, moving from exposure to responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's core motivation (reclaiming the missed doorway moment) is concrete and embodied, and his grim-optimist stance shapes the dice gamble. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("logical fallacy," "thermodynamic violation") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to step through the rupture feels inevitable given the setup, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains intellectual rather than viscerally contradictory. The backstory fragment (woman in doorway) anchors the present stake but occupies significant real estate without a dramatized micro-choice that alters his immediate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's exhaustion is embodied through bruised eyes and trembling hands, and his motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—drives the central ritual with clear stakes. The flashback to the stranger's bread anchors his present action with concrete memory and emotional particularity. However, the final relief and sleep arrival feel slightly too smooth; the transition from tremors to "sweet pull of sleep" lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the closure moment. The methodical hope is asserted more than tested through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to preserve culture through bread-baking is established and embodied through action. The internal logic is consistent—his cultured background, grandmother's teaching method, and museum stewardship cohere. However, the protagonist operates largely unopposed; the central tension is environmental rather than a choice between competing goods with visible personal cost. The final act of distributing letter-bread reads more as pedagogical demonstration than a decision that forecloses a meaningful path or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is declared ("step beyond fate's design") but not embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. His actions follow a straight line—assemble, activate, succeed—with no genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The interiority leans toward ornamental description ("cold electric thrill") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final triumph dissolves inevitability without dramatizing what he surrenders or risks losing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "trick fear into revealing its weakness" drives coherent choices through the funhouse, and his confession of death-wish creates visible contradiction. The Advisor remains peripheral-only and never forces an on-page choice that alters tactics. Interior voice leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("jagged stones," "grinding metal") that sometimes distances us from embodied panic. The final renunciation carries conceptual weight but the emotional cost feels more asserted than inhabitated—his hands shake yet the prose never degrades under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—turn obstacles into instruments—and her method of using resonance shows competence under pressure. However, interiority remains thin; we see her visualization and physical action but little internal contradiction or embodied emotion beyond determination. The final smile and touch feel gestural rather than earned through a visible internal shift with cost. No secondary characters are present to test relationships or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief for her brother, with her "quietly driven" nature embodied through solitary mapping and methodical investigation. Her blowing the whistle represents a meaningful micro-choice that alters the situation, and the final realization about the cage reweights her stance with visible cost (she now knows she was cargo, not passenger). Minor weakness: the transition from cartographer to agent feels slightly compressed, and the ending crystallizes understanding more than showing internal contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "clinical precision" and simultaneous emotional cataloging demonstrate the "emotionally rational" trait effectively, and her micro-choices (stepping on the petal, extending her hand) are embodied. However, interiority leans toward summary ("she processed that fear as a variable") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The Censor remains functional but one-note, present mainly to deliver exposition and capitulate. The final renunciation is earned by the historical parallel but lacks visible internal struggle at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is richly developed through his "stoically sensitive soul" and the philosophical drive behind his secret work. The physical labor (wrestling the stone, smoothing cement) embodies his emotional commitment with concrete actions. However, the motivational arc lacks meaningful internal contradiction—he moves through the sequence with uniform dedication, and the woman's bakery dream arrives as received data rather than a choice that tests competing values. The final "quiet, intense heat" of satisfaction feels earned by effort but not by any fork in the road that might have gone differently.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and grounded in his indexer's logic, with embodied micro-choices (suppressing doubt, forcing readjustment). Internal conflict appears when doubt assaults his mind but is quickly suppressed—more simultaneous contradiction would strengthen. The choice to pocket the stamp and plan dissemination earns the ending, though the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Minor deduction for "dappled resolve hardening in his chest," which edges toward abstract performance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is vivid and embodied through physical action—polishing with denial, breaking skin to bind the dream. Internal contradiction appears in the grinding effort against metaphysical inevitability, and the final release ("Fly") represents a credible choice with visible cost: he sends his grief away rather than hoarding it. Minor weakness: Elara remains a cipher, existing only as object of grief rather than as a person whose traits shape his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied through his physical interaction with the Geode and his visceral reactions ("tears floated from his eyes," "the exhilaration lingered, a toxic hope"). The wedding survivor backstory anchors his obsession effectively, though the moment when he "saw the timeline branch" leans slightly toward declared interiority rather than fully dramatized perception. His final choice to "trip the system again" demonstrates clear agency with visible cost—he knows he's choosing ruin over acceptance. Internal contradiction is present: he seeks connection with the dead while knowing the vision is "mathematical waste product," creating authentic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the "phantom pain" and "missing pieces" metaphor, driving her to the observatory and through the climactic choice. The Pilgrim's frozen surprise is vivid but functions more as atmospheric detail than active characterization. The final choice—extracting the chip—feels somewhat convenient; the moral calculus of deactivating a synthetic entity to achieve personal closure is gestured at but not deeply interrogated. Interiority is controlled and specific, though the "vowels removed" metaphor borders on over-articulate self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and embodied—thirty years of lying culminating in a quest for a stolen truth—and his internal conflict between self-justification and guilt is dramatized through the physical action of sifting driftwood and resisting false memories. The final choice to carry the watch hand back shows visible cost: he accepts the weight of his error without redemption. Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward elevated diction ("conceptually annihilated") that slightly exceeds what a man kneeling in wet sand might frame in crisis, but the embodied shame and trembling hands ground the moment. The renunciation of false heroism and acceptance of irreversible harm qualify as Earned Stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's character emerges through clear, embodied choices: refusing to shiver, lowering his hood to signal openness, and moving with "fluid calmness" under pressure. The drawer pull as a tactile reminder of failure successfully externalizes motivation without therapy-speak. The final choice to leave the brass rose behind feels earned and demonstrates change through action. Minor deduction for "uncommonly thoughtful" operating more as label than constraint in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—his shaking hand, visceral regret "like a loose halyard in a gale," cracked lips forming a merrily melancholic smile. Internal conflict between forced bravery and genuine fear drives the shift from celestial to terrestrial navigation with visible cost: acceptance of smallness. The compass as souvenir and the choice to follow utility poles rather than stars demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "flickering faith" verges on diagnostic label-speak but remains tied to sensory anchors (the pole emerging from fog).

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his emotional arc from apathy to regret is embodied in the final weeping, but the interior work relies heavily on exposition rather than contradiction in scene. The procedure's effect is told efficiently, yet the shift to empathy at the lake arrives through symbolic encounter rather than accumulated micro-choices under pressure. The final sacrifice of the baseball earns the turn, but the path feels more conceptual than behaviorally iterative. Embodiment is present but doesn't reach the level of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear and drives the scene through multiple embodied choices: retrieving the fortune, preparing the censer, refusing to retreat despite agony. The metamorphosis is visceral ("skin hardened, turning from flesh to a translucent, diamond-hard silicate") and contradictory—he loves his mortal form yet endures transformation. Minor issue: the beast whisperer trade is told rather than shown influencing his micro-choices; we see the result (recognition returns) but not his professional instincts shaping tactics during the encounter. The final reunion earns its beat through prior suffering, though the phoenix's recognition feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and specific—seeking lost time with his daughter—but his final choice to "feign confusion" reads more like authorial commentary than an embodied decision under pressure. The interiority carries purple diction ("seduced himself," "crushing magnificence") that distances rather than inhabits his crisis. Internal contradiction appears mainly in that climactic beat of willful self-deception, which lands conceptually but lacks the micro-choices that would show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The cartomancer identity remains ornamental; his skill never constrains a tactic or complicates the ritual's failure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's central contradiction—pacifist by choice, violent by heritage—is clearly established and drives the shadow-integration arc. The embodied manifestation of his happiness through gravitational changes is vivid and specific. However, the "stitching shadow to heel" action lacks micro-choice granularity; the integration happens in a single wave of nausea and rage without visible hesitation or cost-bearing decisions that would foreclose alternate paths. The final acceptance reads more as completion of a mechanical task than an earned moral reckoning with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is established through concrete action—releasing bugs, shedding wealth—but his interior remains abstract. The transformation motivation is told ("seeking to understand the texture") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. His choice at the climax feels passive, a fulfillment of prophecy rather than a willed renunciation with visible cost. The "Empty Man" label supplies thematic gloss but bypasses the character work needed to earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal life is established through specific micro-choices (waiting three years, the liquid grace metaphor, the knowing smile) and her motivation is clear. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor and declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beat shows competence without genuine struggle—she executes a plan flawlessly with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The phrase "treating the chaos not as a crisis, but as a necessary component of her design" reads as authorial summary rather than lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Oren's precognitive curse is concretely rendered through involuntary vector projections, and his mother's deathbed promise drives the ritual. Internal contradiction appears when he seeks stillness while his mind perpetually races forward, but the peak moment—kneeling in friction—reads more as relief than a choice that forecloses a path. The weeping feels earned by prior pressure, though the protagonist remains more observer than agent through most beats. Embodied emotion is strong in the final paragraph; earlier sections lean toward exposition of his condition rather than moment-by-moment struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior state is vividly embodied through "furiously tranquil" and physical anchors (trembling needle, steady hands), but his choices are largely predetermined by the resistance's map rather than meaningful dilemmas he navigates on the page. The final shift from fear to "storm-kissed wonder" reads as emotional declaration rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Backstory (wife, manuscript, friends) primes the map's emotional weight but does not alter present tactics. The renunciation of fear feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas exhibits a distinct motivation ("to turn questions into destinations") and his mechanical arm is well-integrated into action. However, interiority remains thin—his thoughts often sound like philosophical declarations rather than lived contradiction under stress. The phrase "diplomatically fierce" reads more as a label than an embodied trait with visible cost. Kael's silent pleading and immediate stand-down feel convenient rather than earned through prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's molting personalities provide a conceptual hook, but the Architect arrives fully formed without internal contradiction acting *in scene*—he simply replaces the Weeper cleanly. The final stance (planting seeds) feels inevitable from his new state rather than earned through competing impulses. Silas remains functional but flat, existing primarily to receive exposition and enable Elias's geometry. The friendship anchor (prison library sorting) is told rather than dramatized, offering no present friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is internally consistent and his motivation to defy fate through music is clear throughout. The strategic creativity trait shows through his dismantling of the clock and repurposing the projector, though the mechanics feel more explained than tested under pressure. His final choice to enter the film and play the encore is earned by prior setup, but internal contradiction or genuine struggle is minimal—he executes a plan rather than wrestling with conflicting impulses. The embodied emotion is present in "trembling fingers" and "victorious sorrow," though some moments ("steely longing") lean toward label rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his actions align with his role as Reality Checker, but interiority relies heavily on elevated descriptors ("luminous doubt," "radiant skepticism") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to plant the seed is driven by his trade protocols more than internal conflict between competing impulses. Emotional progression is present but operates at a single register throughout; no degradation under stress or irrational self-deception complicates the arc. The verification ritual and physical shielding of the plant show micro-choices, yet the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is specific and embodied through physical ritual ("calloused finger," trembling, sweat), and his motivation drives the action coherently. However, his slow-spoken tutor persona remains largely label-only; the voice never demonstrates this trait through speech rhythm or perception. The emotional arc—from burden to weeping absolution—feels somewhat programmatic, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. Internal conflict is present but not sufficiently layered to escape the therapeutic-resolution template.

    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his background, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied.

Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: an ex–neutron-star researcher using his implant and analytic habits to defend against grief, with that defense credibly strained by the butterfly’s beauty. His motivation to “strip needless drama” is consistent and dramatized through choices of attention and framing rather than mere statement. The internal shift to “quiet grace” at the end feels earned, though the conflict remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. A slightly deeper sense of irrational resistance or self-deception under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific, rooted in her identity as a glass artist, with concrete embodiments of fear, cold, and trauma (“her hands…trembled slightly from the bitter cold and the shock of the last three days”). Her conflicting impulses—run blindly vs. paralyzing fear vs. “purpose in the pauses”—are credible and dramatized through the choice to wait. The shift from aesthetic to survival perception is strong, though phrased a bit abstractly at times (“her perception…was proving to be steadily adaptive”). The final choice to follow the tracks reads as an earned, quiet hardening of resolve with a felt cost, but the moral and psychological ambiguity could go one notch deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation and history are sharply defined—capsize survivor, obsessive about turning silence into music—and his physicality (gait, scars, hand language) is concretely grounded. His trauma intrudes once at a key moment (“the memory of the freezing ocean wave”), but internal contradiction is relatively light: he mostly channels everything into competence rather than facing a real value clash. Micro-choices (tool selection, how hard to strike, whether to push past fear) are present but not strongly tiered against competing desires. The result is a vivid, particular character whose emotional life could use one more knot of on-page conflict to reach elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Silas’s core motivation—an exhausted professional chasing silence for selfish, work-warped reasons—is clear and particular, and his occupation colors both his worldview and key choices (“closing a casket,” “address was filed”). The line about being “inadvertently stubborn” neatly links trait to behavior (three-day ocean walk) and to his inability to abandon a burial in progress. What’s missing at this level is more on-page contradiction or live internal conflict under pressure; once he arrives, his course feels inevitable rather than contested. The ending offers an earned endurance/stasis rather than a change, which works, but the emotional cost remains mostly implied fatigue rather than something sharper or stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and values are clear and specific—her insistence on anonymity and intergenerational solidarity feels rooted in character, not just theme. Interiority is present but somewhat told (“a leader defined by being gently persistent”) rather than tested in on-page contradiction or failure. Her actions align closely with her ethos, especially in the ritual with the bell and her refusal to take credit. The lack of a sharp internal conflict or visible emotional cost undercuts the depth needed for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivation is vivid and specific—his past-life regret and obsession with “unused love” clearly drive every choice, especially his decision to expend his own stored affection to heal the ghost. His professional identity as a camera obscura artist meaningfully colors how he engages with the supernatural. However, his internal conflict feels relatively unresisted (he rarely doubts, fears, or hesitates), which limits complexity. A bit more friction or contradiction at the moment of sacrifice would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically tied to his profession and grief, and his actions (stealing the halo fragment, forcing the vines into a geometry trap) are consistent with that drive. However, his interiority stays largely on one note of desperate purpose; the piece doesn’t dramatize much active ambivalence about losing his memories or fear of what success might cost him. The grief images are vivid but function more as visual obstacles than as sites of conflicted feeling in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation as a long-prepared guardian of the seed vault is clear and consistent, and his calm, methodical actions under pressure align with that goal. The decade of captivity and forged chains add weight to his endurance choice at the end. However, his internal life remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized—there’s little on-page tension between self-preservation and duty. The result is strong but not yet psychologically rich enough for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession and professional specificity are vivid, with a clear through-line from motivation (“find the sound of trust breaking”) to her methods. However, she operates almost entirely in a single emotional register—focused, grim, exhausted—so we don’t see much internal contradiction or value hierarchy tested on the page. Her rare condition and the stakes of the commission promise richer inner conflict than is actually dramatized. The closing endurance stance feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, competence, and metaphysical hunger are clear and distinctive, and her choices (stealing the portrait, obeying the flower-code, developing the image) track cleanly with those traits. However, her interiority under pressure remains relatively calm and declarative; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine struggle, even when fate appears to answer back. The final realization reconfigures her future but stops short of an on-page decision or renunciation. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet at an elite, fully conflicted level.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to craft “safe zones for inquiry” in a regime that punishes curiosity—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, especially the final decision to leave. His interior contradiction (need for isolation to build the domes vs. the realization that isolation has become a tomb) is dramatized rather than stated. Embodied emotion comes through in his theatrical speeches to dead machinery and his sudden, telling lapse into silence. The only thing holding this just below the top band is that his inner misbeliefs and blind spots could be tested one more beat before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s characterization is vivid and internally conflicted—paralyzing terror vs. a forced, tactical focus—and his final choice to trap himself in the dark while redirecting the fire feels earned. The stunt-double backstory and "defect in his vat-grown amygdala" ground his hyper-vigilance and terror in the world logic. Micro-choices like using his panic as "high-frequency radar" and reading the cast via indentations reveal a specific, non-generic mind under pressure. The only softness is a slightly abstract statement of motive (“prove that vulnerability is power”) that’s more told than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—to create a map so remaining souls are not lost in the coming oblivion—is clear and consistently drives her actions, and her tactile engagement with objects (stones, booklet, charcoal) gives her some specificity. However, interior contradiction and emotional complexity are limited; she reads as serenely purposeful rather than torn, which flattens potential conflict in such an extreme scenario. Her “mild obsession” with the gold leaf is nicely particular, especially when it culminates in placing the final flake, but we don’t see it complicate her choices in a way that reveals deeper flaws. The final endurance/acceptance beat is credible but emotionally under-textured for a pinnacle moment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    734’s motivation and worldview are sharply defined—his “defect” functioning as curiosity and his cataloging of “ozone and regret” feel particular and alive. His micro-choices (studying the violin instead of merely incinerating, scanning for “that elusive spark of genesis”) consistently stem from this. Internal contradiction (duty vs. obsession) is present but underplayed; the story stops short of forcing him into a truly costly choice between cleaning quickly and pursuing his question. The ending’s quiet endurance—he throws the violin away and archives the data—feels psychologically credible but not deeply torn.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motive (to clear his name and reach Mara) is clear and consistent, and Mara’s suspicion-to-softening arc tracks credibly given what she’s shown. His secrecy, risk in revealing the tickets, and final unshielded projection all feel like motivated, escalating choices. The interiority is more distilled than deep, but the emotional logic is individual rather than generic. The one softness is how quickly Mara’s long-held mistrust dissolves once she looks through the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian is sharply etched through concrete habits—his care with the vine, his penitent use of the marbles—so his motivation feels rooted and consistent. The sub-prefect functions as a clear foil, if somewhat one-note, effectively sharpening Elian’s stance rather than emerging as a fully realized character. The backstory of fraud repurposed into penance gives Elian a credible moral complication without overexplaining. There is limited explicit internal contradiction on the page, but his quiet defiance against the regime’s metrics carries implied tension between guilt and stubborn hope.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s characterization as an obliging mechanic hiding a radical obsession is clear and specific, with his quiet competence and secretive defiance consistently motivating his choices. The pull between stepping sideways and remaining in his role gives him a credible internal conflict in the climax. Emotional response is mostly embodied (the cold, the warmth of the machine, his hammering heart) rather than labeled. The main limitation is that the cost of either choice is kept conceptual rather than deeply personal, so the renunciation lands as elegant but a bit cool.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession and interiority are vivid and specific—his sense of being an “in between” figure and the alien, feverish creativity feel psychologically grounded. Motivation (to decipher the Maestro’s code) clearly drives each micro-choice, from risking the antique program to kicking the water. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; he rarely wavers or resists the compulsion, which slightly flattens potential tension. The final sense of completion—conversation finished yet alone—reads as an earned, quiet reconfiguration rather than a full-scale transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motives and constraints are sharply etched: engineered fault-tolerance, horror at the cascade, and the need to avoid panic coherently drive his choices. His internal conflict—duty to truth vs. duty to systemic stability—is dramatized through concrete actions like suppressing outliers and later using the smudge. The emotional burden at the end (“existing quietly in the margins of the apocalypse”) feels earned and character-specific. There is limited contradiction in his impulses on the page, but for this scope it still lands strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation—testing whether negligence can weigh as heavily as malice—is clear, specific, and governs his choices, especially in how he reads the valve and interprets the confession. His interiority is vivid and embodied (“drowsy alertness,” the feel of the condensation as sweat) with a credible contradiction between skeptical rationalism and his quasi-mystical “data” practice. The closing adjustment—his burden “slightly easier to carry”—feels earned by prior setup rather than tacked on. A minor limitation is that his past accident is gestured at rather than slightly more concretely dramatized, keeping his guilt a bit abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to witness change without judgment—is clear, consistent, and organically linked to her final renunciation of the archive-keeper role. Her interiority is specific (her vague recognition of the fern, her acceptance of hallucinated scholars) but largely single-note; we see little contradictory impulse or cost-laden hesitation about leaving the library. The arthritis vanishing at the folding moment nicely externalizes a shift in agency without over-explaining it. The final transformation into “keeper of the quiet” feels earned but emotionally serene rather than conflicted, which limits depth at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—he wants to pierce Elara’s dementia and nurture her wonder—and his tactics (music, timing, the curl) closely align with that. His emotional state is embodied ("rising tide of cautious exuberance," careful physical handling of the curl) and consistent with his “mellow” profile. Elara is more of an object of care than an agent, but her brief return—eyes brightening, gasp, tears—registers as a real, specific shift rather than a generic “lucid moment.” The main limitation is minimal contradictory impulses or visible cost in Elias beyond generic restraint; his inner conflict never sharpens into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s core motivation and method are clear and nicely particular—“collect the stories walls have heard” feels distinct. However, he remains largely a single-register observer with little visible internal conflict or cost; his emotional state doesn’t shift much despite uncovering an epochal tragedy. We don’t see contradictory impulses or a genuine test of his values. The final “duty fulfilled” beat reads more procedural than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Arthur’s vocation, isolation, and unease about becoming “accidentally prophetic” create a specific, memorable consciousness, and his choice to sabotage the light is clearly motivated by that dread. However, his internal conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized under pressure, and we never feel a real push–pull between duty to the network, fear of consequences, and desire for freedom in the moment of choice. The musical self-description (“transpose life into a new key”) is evocative but slightly abstract, diluting the texture of his embodied fear. A bit more contradiction or cost in his final act would deepen him substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kellen is sharply sketched—his competence, vocation, and tools all feel specific, and his motivation to free Elias is clear and consistent. However, he reads as almost entirely assured and in control; there’s little sense of internal contradiction, doubt, or emotional cost in him under pressure. Elias functions mainly as a suffering object rather than a fully realized second character. The final beat shows human emotion from Elias, but his interiority is otherwise underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation—to capture the universe’s hidden music and thereby heal his temporal dislocation—is specific, consistent, and dramatized through concrete methods (grease-pencil notation, the Nautilus shell). The “chronologically homesick” ache gives him contradiction (deep nostalgia vs. cold, quasi-scientific method) that plays directly into the climax. Emotional states are more shown than labeled, with good embodiment (“felt in his teeth and his bones”). The final reprieve from homesickness feels earned, though his flaws and costs could be shaded with slightly more friction to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation—remain whole in one timeline by completing the walk—is clear, specific, and persistently under pressure. Her internal conflict between the seductive scattering into other selves and the “crushing…burden of being real” is dramatized in concrete choices (trusting the tablet’s “illogical left turn,” then relinquishing gravity). Emotions are mostly embodied through sensory overload and physical strain rather than labels. The only limitation is that we glimpse her primarily as a metaphysical struggler, with little non-cosmic personal texture to deepen individuality further.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and specific—defeat emotional numbness through an extreme, tactile ritual—and his interiority is rendered with embodied detail rather than labels. The progression from fogged detachment to overwhelming sorrow feels earned by the escalating physical experience. There is some lack of internal contradiction or moral messiness around his choice to self-harm the recording, which keeps the psychology from feeling fully three-dimensional. Still, the final shift to “ready to teach again” is convincingly rooted in what we’ve just seen.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, integrity, and competence under pressure are sharply drawn, and her choices (taking the tube, choosing the lateral escape) are consistent with those traits. However, her inner life is relatively tidy: there’s little simultaneous pull between competing impulses (e.g., to protect instruments vs. escape), so the final stance feels more like confirmation than change. The “credibly curious, possessed of a scientific mind” line is a labeled trait rather than dramatized conflict and slightly flattens her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—personally testing the Lily’s scent to understand her own violent tear response—is clear, specific, and carries through every choice, especially the reckless removal of the respirator. Her profession as a “wistful lantern broker” and aromatically cautious nature create a credible contradiction between caution and sacrifice. Emotional reactions are mostly embodied (“sank to the cold tiles,” “tears…like drops of mercury”) rather than abstractly labeled. A slight limitation is that beyond her father and this single obsession, we glimpse little of her broader life or sharper idiosyncrasies, which holds her just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s artistic obsession, his history with the prison rope, and his flirtation with annihilation under pressure create a specific, believable psyche whose final renunciation feels earned. The internal conflict between becoming “the verse itself” and remaining a limited human is sharply drawn in the moment when the rope smokes and his heart stutters. His emotions are mostly embodied through tactile and sensory detail rather than labels. A slightly fuller sense of his irrational attachments or blind spots beyond art (e.g., any human tie) could deepen the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, sensory curse, and ethic of “finding beauty in the unfinished” are clear and specific, and her small ritual choices (how she tends the flame, how she plays) align with those traits. Interiority is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. We rarely see her actively wrestling, in the moment, with the cost of listening/playing versus retreating from pain. The final endurance choice (to play, then leave the song unresolved) is motivated and fitting, but its emotional ambiguity could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is sharply drawn—his professionalism, moral positioning, and sensory idiosyncrasy feel specific—while Elara remains more archetypal, defined almost entirely by her grief. His stated motive “to fuse insight with empathy” coheres with his actions, but he experiences little visible internal conflict under pressure. Elara’s surrender is credible but underexplored; we don’t see contradictory impulses contending in the moment of choice. The final stasis (her sedation, his distance) is earned but emotionally cleaner than the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear, specific, and tied to past experience (the stranger who funded his first venture), and his anxiety vs. desire to connect gives him a credible internal tension. His professional habits (“whimsically attentive,” fixation on delivery) are nicely repurposed into social stakes. The librarian is sketched quickly but gains dimension in her reaction to the locket, moving beyond a stock caretaker. The main limitation is that Elias’s conflict resolves a bit smoothly; there’s little sense of genuine risk or flaw that might cost him more than momentary nervousness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to graft herself onto the community—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in comforting the boy and in how she answers the tag with her art. Her empathy versus the world’s hard stoicism gives her a specific, embodied personality. Internal contradiction is relatively light (she rarely seems truly torn), but the closing shift from outsider to kin is earned by prior behavior. Secondary characters remain archetypal but function effectively as a collective crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to capture the primal echo) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her professionalism as an illustrator is well-folded into action (charcoal sticks ready, frantic sketching). The visible cost at the end—physical aging—reconfigures her relationship to her own goal in a credible way. What’s missing for a higher score is on-page contradictory impulse or deeper internal conflict (no real hesitation about sacrificing her lifespan or uncaging the echo). Her emotional life is more implied by the stakes than distinctly dramatized in her body and thought moment by moment.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas’s core motivation—solving grief as an equation to find his daughter—is vivid and consistent, and his actions align cleanly with that drive. We get a particular worldview (mathematical, meticulous, anti-spectacle) that feels character-specific. However, internal contradiction (hope vs. rationalism, terror vs. control) is mostly stated rather than dramatized in real-time micro-choices, so his emotional struggle never fully combusts on the page. The final “buried optimism” is earned but arrives more as a narrated label than as a pressured, messy realization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn through habit, environment, and a specific yearning—to be seen as providence rather than intrusion—which cleanly motivates every choice. His internal contradiction (erasure vs visibility) is dramatized rather than told, especially in the risk of placing the tape within her reach. Embodied perception (“calloused but impossibly gentle,” reverence for conduit like “hollow-boned fossils”) gives him individuality. The librarian is only lightly sketched, but enough to function as a real counter-presence to his longing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s characterization is rich and coherent: a reclusive, hyper-rational botanist who intellectualizes terror into scientific language. His denial and fear are dramatized through specific behaviors (studying the leaf, clinging to “reconstructing” the hybrid). The internal contradiction—desire for control vs. bodily surrender—is clear and pays off in his final choice. A slightly deeper sense of his life-before (relationships, specific losses) could sharpen the felt cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s obsessive drive to “thresh meaning from experience” is specific, embodied, and credibly escalates to the self-destructive barter of the filter. The trade reads as both coherent with his artistic extremism and costly enough to feel like an earned, character-driven climax. Interiority is textured (fatigue, awe, irony) without lapsing into therapy-speak. The scavenger is sketched but effective as a pressure agent, though Elias’s hesitation at risking his lifeline could be sharpened one notch more on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization as a powerful but blinkered seer is clear and her arc—from horizon-gazer to someone newly aware of the present—is convincingly motivated by the encounter. Her interiority is specific to her vocation (tapestry of fate, filtering out “microscopic miracles”) rather than generic mystic talk. Kael is thinner but adequate as a catalyst, and the status dynamic (renowned seer vs. ragged pilgrim) is legible. The main weakness is that her realization comes in relatively abstract, essayistic language instead of being more tightly embodied in her moment-to-moment perception and conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and specific—moving from microscopic, solitary work to addressing a communal silence—and his archivist mindset coherently informs his choice to "compile fragments into meaning" via sound. Emotional texture is embodied in small observations (islands of intimacy, navigated absences) rather than labels. However, he faces little genuine internal contradiction or visible cost; once he perceives the problem, he simply executes the correct solution. The arc lands more as a graceful fulfillment of a latent trait than a pressured, conflicted change.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motives and traits are sharply etched: obsessive mapping, outsider status, and a need to validate her “madness” all cohere and drive her choices. The internal conflict between fear and conviction at the chasm (“trembling certainty”) feels lived rather than stated. The late admission that her mapping is “merely a defense mechanism against the chaos of human intimacy” veers toward diagnostic, but it is earned enough by prior behavior. The final act—shattering her own jar—is credibly motivated by the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s blend of scientific rigor and emerging openness is well-drawn, and her decision to risk academic standing to preserve the tower’s “emotional archive” feels earned. The interior conflict between skepticism and the undeniable experiential data of the memories is credibly staged. Some trait-labeling (“sympathetic skeptic,” “courageously kind”) and slightly abstract emotional language flatten what could be even more particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s core motivation (boredom with immortality and obsession with “what happens after goodbye”) is clear and plausibly drives him to a self-annihilating experiment, and his actions under pressure track cleanly with that goal. However, his interiority stays mostly in the register of abstract cosmological and thematic language rather than embodied, character-particular feeling, so we miss contradictory impulses or concrete emotional struggle in the moment. The final choice to step into dissolution is conceptually earned but emotionally smooth, with little visible hesitation or irrational back-and-forth.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Julian’s and Vance’s motivations are clear and coherent—Julian’s fixation on “fair trade” versus Vance’s binary legality—and their choices track believably within the magical premise. The status dynamics in the room (Julian’s tactical silence, Vance’s initial authority) are well-handled and do shift once the ink works. However, interior conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in scene, especially for Julian, who feels more like an articulated concept than a fully embodied psyche. Vance’s transformation is emotionally striking but relies heavily on the ink’s property rather than layered prior contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is sharply etched: disciplined, reverent toward her tools, yet underwritten by “burning curiosity,” and her professional identity feels specific rather than generic. Her motivation (to fabricate a commissioned history) is clear and consistent with her behavior. However, internal conflict (duty vs curiosity, ethics of lying vs craft pride) is implied more than dramatized, so the cost of her choices never quite bites. The ending is more a confirmation of who she is than a meaningful change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s motivation and perceptual style are vivid and consistent, and their vocation as “archivist of the unremembered” clearly drives every action. However, the piece offers almost no internal contradiction or live dilemma; the protagonist never seriously wavers, doubts, or pays an immediate emotional price for their chosen role. The dead-on-paper status is thematically rich but underused as a source of character conflict in the present scene. The result is a strong, memorable figure whose arc feels more like a stable pose than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to test whether the universe has a narrative—is clear, specific, and rooted in his long career as a myth buster, and his shift from debunker to documenter feels earned. The “gloomy cheerfulness” and self-excoriating realizations give him a particular interior texture, not a stock skeptic. However, his emotional beats sometimes lean on abstract summary (“fear disguised as logic, loneliness disguised as independence”) rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The ex-wife and mentor exist only as voices, so relationship pressure is thematic rather than dynamically on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and active—her role, dual allegiance, and attachment to the pontoons all drive what she does. Her competence feels earned, especially in the lines about perceiving drift and drag as an equation. However, her internal conflict is more declared than dramatized; we’re told about the “dangerous dual allegiance” but rarely feel a live tug-of-war in her moment-to-moment choices. The emotional cost of betraying her employers is implied conceptually rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in a believable flaw—his “purposefully curious” nonconformity—and it cleanly drives every on-page choice. The internal conflict between safety/conformity and the illicit pursuit of beauty is present, though it stays relatively straightforward rather than deeply contradictory. Embodied details (cold as “a gnawing teeth-ache in his bones,” pressing his fingertip into the sand grain) give his emotional state texture. The closure—a quiet endurance that secures the image at conceptual cost—is well earned by what we’ve seen of him.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a calm, gifted, almost devotional mechanic whose motivation to repair the drone is consistent and believable, especially in touches like “with the tenderness of a physician.” However, there’s little internal conflict or ambivalence—he never doubts, wavers, or pays a visible personal price, so the character feels steady rather than transformed. The courier functions purely as a plot-delivery device with no real pressure on him. The ending is an earned endurance of his existing stance rather than a deepened or reconfigured self.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply etched: the world-weary precision of a “senior atlas editor” who treats miracles like paperwork is distinctive and consistent, and his motivations (to correct maps, to locate an origin that can’t be codified) feel rooted in that temperament. His dry wit (“as one might acknowledge a punctual train,” “He preferred his miracles to be legible and filed in triplicate.”) carries real character. Internal conflict is milder: he’s mostly steady in his stance rather than visibly torn, so the final renunciation (not recording coordinates) feels natural but not heavily contested. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible, though its cost (his complicity in keeping the world ignorant) is only subtly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas is clearly defined as patient, ritualistic, and attuned to the city, and his actions (waiting, stepping, heel-tapping) are motivated by that vocation and worldview. However, he reads more as an archetypal guardian or priest of balance than as a fully contradictory, internally conflicted individual. His emotional texture is mostly inferred from the setting and his role, with limited nuanced interiority beyond calm dedication. The endurance at the end is credible but not deeply personalized in terms of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to prioritize preserving a lost civilization’s final testament over her own survival—is clear, consistent, and sharpened through the oxygen constraint. Her internal conflict between survival instinct and chosen duty is credibly dramatized (“Every biological impulse screamed at her… but she stayed her hand”), and her final acceptance of death feels earned. However, she remains more an emblematic martyr than a fully individuated person; her interiority is compelling but somewhat archetypal rather than idiosyncratically hers.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to escape scapegoating and erase the noise of his father’s lies—is clear, specific, and coherently carried into his final choice to step through the impossible door. His interiority is textured (“chasing hush,” handling the lattice, the weight of foreseen disaster) and avoids stock phrasing. Internal contradiction (guilt vs. self-preservation, urge to warn vs. desire for silence) is present but more implied than dramatized in real-time choices. The ending offers an earned reconfiguration of his stance, though we could see his conflicting impulses tested under more direct on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian’s motivation (seeking a cure and honoring an ancestral bargain) is clear and consistent, and his fear and desperation are credibly embodied in how he moves through the predatory greenhouse. The closing “mournful elation” feels earned and particular rather than generic relief. However, his interior conflict is relatively simple—there’s little sense of competing impulses or moral hesitation in accepting the ghost bride’s help. The ghost bride’s stated motivation works, but it’s told in a summarizing sentence rather than revealed through conflicted behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to defy the elders’ fatalism by literally mending the city—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted through her dangerous sewing. Her perception of the canyon as a “stanza waiting to be revised” gives her an individualized interiority and links craft to worldview. However, internal conflict is minimal: once she enters the trance, there’s little sense of competing impulses or fear intruding on her drive. The final cost is mostly physical exhaustion rather than a deeper value conflict or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to bridge diaspora dislocation and restore a sense of familial and spiritual continuity—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her tenderness toward the bones and her intuitive method of following roots reveal a coherent, particular interiority rather than a generic “seeker” archetype. The final shift into grounded belonging feels earned by the prior work of reconstruction, though internal conflict could be sharpened with a more tangible moment of doubt or resistance. A few explanatory lines (“This tenderness was necessary…”) slightly over-clarify what the images already carry.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian is sharply etched through his habits—fountain pen, vellum, affection for slowness—and his vocation as a “specialist in the obsolete art of privacy” gives him a distinct worldview. His motivation and values are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (name selection, ritualistic folding, lingering despite the rush) emerge naturally from them. What’s missing for top-tier characterization is genuine internal contradiction or pressure: he never wavers or reveals a conflicting impulse, so we get depth of type rather than a fully fraught human knot. With no other on-page character to serve as crucible, his limits, flaws, and blind spots remain largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa is sharply drawn: the frail act, the sudden straightening once Kael leaves, and her esoteric working at the loom all convey an individual with specific skills and tactics. Her opposition to Kael and loyalty to the unseen victims of the coup are clear and credible. What’s missing for the very top tier is deeper contradiction or internal friction; she never seriously wavers, and her emotional cost remains mostly implied rather than felt on the page. Kael functions well as an external pressure but stays close to archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    Julian’s motivation is clear and specific—he wants to pinpoint the moment before he left and re-interpret it—and his shame and regret are credibly embodied in details like his trembling hands and “shame burning his throat.” The link between the gargoyle shard and his departure efficiently externalizes his inner fracture. However, his internal conflict remains relatively tidy; we see regret and longing but not much simultaneous, contradictory impulse under pressure. Elara is effective as a secondary character, but she functions more as an archetypal guide than a fully individuated presence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and plausibly tied to his history as a translator; his compulsion to “translate” the cast into something gentler is well motivated and earned. The embodied details (finger on coral, trembling hand with pen) keep emotions grounded. Internal conflict does exist—his trauma and guilt versus his wish to protect Leo—but it stays relatively smooth, without much visible friction or self-deception. The final act of rewriting is credible and costs him emotionally, but the cost remains implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and emotional throughline are clear and specific—blocked artist seeking lost joy—and her actions align with that drive. The internal tension between anxiety and “pensive mirth” is there, but it stays gentle and could dig deeper into contradiction or self-sabotage to feel fully lived. Micro-choices (using the fragment, deciding to treat the fog as film, pushing herself physically) do reveal character. The final renewed readiness to work is earned, if a bit neatly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s desire to exchange certainty for curiosity is clearly dramatized through the layered dream states and his final answer to Ms. Vance, and the hobo nickel nicely externalizes his relationship to risk and perception. However, his emotional experience remains more conceptual than embodied—there’s little felt fear, confusion, or resistance as he falls through realities. Ms. Vance functions mainly as a prompt, not a genuine relational crucible. The final stance is earned but could land harder with more visible internal conflict along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian’s characterization is vivid and specific—a rogue scholar gaming the thought-tax system with riddles and analog subterfuge—and his core motive (protecting mental autonomy) is clear and consistent. However, his inner conflict is minimal; we don’t see much simultaneous push-pull between fear, self-preservation, and principle in the stressful closing beats. Dr. Aris functions mostly as a foil/expositor rather than a fully realized crucible relationship. The final act of tossing the seed is credible and motivated but feels more like a foregone role than a pressured, morally complicated choice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation—to transmute grief into beauty and finally release his anchor—is clear, consistent, and particular to his history and temperament. His immortal insomnia, the “toxic isotope” of grief, and his tactile obsession with the postcard all ground his interiority in specific, embodied habits. The final choice to bury the postcard reads fully earned by the prior centuries-weight of clinging and the cultivated garden as counterweight. I’d only nudge higher if we saw more sharply dramatized internal resistance at the precise moment of letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s vocation and loneliness are sharply etched, and his motivation—to preserve the sound of forgotten names—clearly governs every action. Interiority is specific (“foxglove regret,” the imagined scavenger), and small physical choices (trembling fingers, humming) reveal his care and fragility. That said, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; we don’t quite see competing impulses clash in scene so much as a steady, melancholy devotion. The final endurance choice feels earned but is emotionally monotone rather than turbulently conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—an arcane linguist trying to repair trust through dangerous truth-magic—and her choices under pressure track cleanly from that. The emotional risk of uncorking Veritas Aeterna and persisting through the chaos feels earned and aligned with her desperation. Kael is thinner, mostly registering as reactions and one decisive move (dropping the bag and taking her hand), so the relationship is slightly weighted toward her interiority. The final reconnection reads as earned but a touch tidy, with limited depiction of truly contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation—to subvert the rationing laws to save the banished families—is clear, consistent, and appropriately heightened by the risk of treason. His competence is well-grounded in specific craft detail, and his fear/resolve mix is embodied in physical sensations (trembling hands, sweat, attention to machinery). The internal contradiction between obedience and compassion is present but mostly summarized (“harmonize conflicting values”) rather than fully dramatized in on-page hesitation or morally messy thought. The final “ghost in the machine” stance reads as earned endurance, though the emotional cost could be shaded more granularly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivations are clear and particular—his preference for birds, his cultivated anonymity, and his obsession with the meteorite’s song—and his final choice to share the secret reads as an earned soft reversal. His internal contradiction (hoarding solitude vs. needing the sky and another witness) is present but could be deepened under pressure. The woman, however, is more function than person; her exhaustion is gestured at, but her motive and stakes are underdeveloped, limiting the relational crucible. The emotional shift toward trust comes a bit quickly for “decades” of self-exile, though it is not wholly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—locating the moment the world lost its boundaries to understand and repair it—is clear, rooted in her childhood in her father’s corn mazes, and carried coherently through to the final resolve to “rebuild the walls.” Her interiority is specific and character-particular, especially the maze memories that nuance her fear of being “everywhere at once.” The main limitation is that her conflicting impulses (awe vs terror, desire to know vs fear of cost) are more implied than actively dramatized in on-page micro-choices, leaving the internal conflict slightly under-pressured. Still, the final renunciation of bridge-building in favor of walls feels earned by the prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s longing for belonging, her history with the destroyed observatory, and the burnt feather give her a coherent, particular psychology that pays off in the final renunciation. Her motives are clear and consistent, and the moment of release feels earned by the on-page experience of the ostracods. Internal contradiction (her old skyward striving vs. surrendering to the deep) is present but could be sharpened with one more beat of resistance before she lets go. Kael is sketched but effective as a catalytic presence with a distinct, quiet competence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s voice and sensibility are sharply drawn—her "cheerful gloom," morbid curiosity, and professional obsession feel distinct and consistent. Her micro-choices (scrambling for the seeds, embracing the tragic light show, choosing hope as the missing emotion) all reveal character in action. What’s missing at this tier is real internal contradiction or cost: she never seriously wavers or pays a price for her obsession, and the final “closure” largely affirms who she already is. The result is vivid but emotionally safer than the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply etched as a meticulous, quasi-magical engineer of chance, with a clear, consistent motivation and distinctive inner logic. His micro-choices (placement of bishop, angle of can, decision to recede into shadow) track well with that motive. However, he faces almost no internal contradiction or real resistance; the piece avoids any meaningful struggle or cost to him beyond quiet anonymity. The young woman functions only as a reactive instrument rather than a character with discernible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra’s core motivation (escape from the nostalgia ban via exile and illicit inscription) is clear and consistent, and her tide-dancer training meaningfully shapes how she approaches the ritual. However, her emotional palette trends narrow—she moves from suffocated to resolute with little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse under pressure. The “obsidian grace” composure is striking but overemphasized, flattening moments where fear, doubt, or grief could complicate her choice. The final decision to step into exile feels earned, but emotionally it reads as elegant more than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s vocation, perceptual habits, and insecurity about his work are clearly and consistently motivated, and his final shift—from wanting to “fix” to wanting to “frame”—is earned. The internal conflict between anxiety about exposure and desire to reveal beauty is credible, if gently rendered. Some emotions are labeled or explained rather than fully embodied (“His motivation was simple yet profound”), which slightly flattens complexity. Still, his choices (building the atrium, performing the ritual, accepting the message) track cleanly with his traits.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is sharply drawn—his burned body, occupational competence, and guilt over surviving the entrapment all align with his present quest, and the bargain of innocence feels particular rather than generic trauma. His ritual on the ridge and tenderness with the box reveal values under pressure. However, internal contradiction is mostly summarized (he once believed in heroes, now in endurance) rather than dramatized as competing impulses in the present scene, so the final softening toward acceptance comes off as slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s core motivation and method—engineering hope through mathematics—are specific and consistent, and his calm competence fits the “logical dreamer” concept. However, he experiences little visible internal contradiction or emotional volatility under pressure; the piece lacks a true moment where competing impulses pull him in different directions. His micro-choices (designing, launching, monitoring) align with his stated goal but rarely expose deeper flaws or blind spots. The ending acceptance (“knew when to stop calculating and simply breathe”) is pleasant but feels more like a gentle shift than a costly, character-redefining turn.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and secret motive (“to discover what walls dream about”) create a clear, specific psychology, and his empathic sensitivity is shown in embodied ways (chest tightening, reading frequencies as abandonment). His shift from “professional detachedness” to “sole keeper of a crime” reads earned and gives the piece an internal arc. However, his internal conflict stays mostly implied; he doesn’t visibly wrestle with whether to expose, destroy, or carry the evidence—he simply accepts the burden. A slightly sharper on-page moral struggle at the end would deepen his characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear and character-specific, and the man’s emotional state is efficiently sketched through the mirror. However, Elara’s interiority remains largely functional to the conceit; we see very little contradictory impulse or personal cost, which flattens her beyond “mysterious helper.” Her calm professionalism under pressure reads, but she never truly struggles or hesitates. The man’s shift from despair to resolve is believable but schematic, more emblematic than individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen, Hark, and Vena are sharply etched with distinct roles, histories, and emotional textures, and their motives (end the war, defend legacies, avoid meaningless philosophy) feel coherent. Kaelen’s operative gentleness is dramatized in how he frames the ritual and handles the generals. The warlords’ willingness to participate in the ritual comes a touch quickly, softening the sense of genuine resistance under such deep-rooted brutality. Still, the final act of signing beneath their children’s names feels emotionally and logically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vance’s contradiction—profiteer of drought and secret mourner of what he’s killed—is sharply drawn and governs every choice, especially the irrational decision to incubate the egg. Interiority is specific and embodied (“Italian leather shoes coated in fine saline dust,” joints popping in the stillness). His sentimentality isn’t a label; it clearly drives him to an action with no rational upside. The final Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he leaves the egg behind, neither redeeming nor renouncing himself—feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation to defy the Lullaby and save the city is clear and her choices track cleanly from that drive, especially in the final beat where she pulls the anchor thread despite the risk of “a lobotomy of the soul.” Her courtesan identity and refusal of physical intimacy add specificity and thematic charge, and the line about “giving away the intimacy she had hoarded” gives her a credible cost. However, she is almost entirely resolute; there’s little on-page contradictory impulse or genuine hesitation under pressure, which flattens her complexity. The High Magistrate remains a symbolic antagonist rather than a character who actively complicates her psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s characterization is vivid and specific—urbane, disciplined, “trading in the fluidity of shadows,” with his calligrapher’s mindset shaping how he uses the puppets and reads narrative. His motivation (to counter the heckler by demonstrating an alternative ethic of endings) is clear and consistent with his temperament. However, his internal conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses in the moment; he never feels truly torn. Secondary characters exist only as a diffuse crowd and the heckler-as-impulse, so relationship pressure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—honoring the uncelebrated dead of the ecosystem—is clear, specific, and governs his choices (the moth wing, the fragile signal structure). His interiority is filtered through concrete ritual acts rather than abstract musings, which gives him texture. However, his internal conflict stays mostly conceptual; we don’t quite see a sharp, contradictory impulse under peak pressure, only a steady, composed reverence. The final renunciation (turning away, letting the structure fall) is earned but could carry more explicit emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and vocation are sharply drawn, and the connection between his craft and his emotional state is convincing. His guilt and self-forgiveness are stated clearly, and some gestures (“rough, scarred hands…delicacy of a surgeon”) embody him well. However, internal contradiction is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in live, pressured choices. The final sense of redemption lands, but with relatively little on-page struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific, rooted in the curse of “foresight hindsight only” and her compulsion to act in the blind present. Her motivation—to understand why some paths choose their walkers and to reject the bunker’s dead laws—credibly drives the choice to break the seal and pull the lever. The climactic act feels earned, but her fear of death versus desire for transcendence could be dramatized in more contradictory, moment-to-moment impulses. Emotional embodiment is solid but slightly more told/philosophical than viscerally felt in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bel-ibni is sharply etched through parsimony, rationalism, and hidden reverence, with actions (snuffing torches, guarding chalk, ritual precision) consistently embodying his traits. His motivation to preserve knowledge via a logically structured “ritual” fits his psychology and drives every move. Internal contradiction—skeptic-turned-reluctant mystic—is present but could be dramatized with one stronger moment of doubt or temptation under pressure. The final nod and extinguished candle give a credible earned stasis without feeling sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian and Kaelen are sharply sketched with coherent, opposing worldviews, and Elian’s “scheming pacifist” contradiction concretely drives his tactics here. Kaelen’s internal shift via the cylinder and broken pin feels psychologically legible, not just declared. The key cost—Kaelen’s surrender of his own conception of strength—is clear and earned. The only shortfall is that their embodied reactions under peak stress sometimes tilt toward abstract explanation (“teach resentment to release its chokehold”) rather than fully dramatized, messy feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas’s goal and method are clear, and his professionalism gives him a distinct profile, but his inner life remains comparatively thin for this level of lyric intensity. We understand what he wants more than how it feels to risk himself for it, beyond generic “lungs burning” and awareness of danger. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses—no serious temptation to abandon the ritual or doubt its worth. The final beat gives him achievement but not a clearly felt emotional cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is sharply etched—her cranky tenderness, professionalism, and domestic metaphors (“I’ve raised three toddlers and a husband”) fuse into a specific, memorable person whose choices drive the scene. Motivation is clear and particular (not coin but generational maintenance-as-love), and her stubbornness credibly pushes her past the “sensible artificer” retreat point. Internal contradiction is present but light: she’s more steadfast than conflicted, so the emotional cost of using the ribbon is felt but could be deepened. Still, her final stance about change feels earned by the sequence of failed attempts and memory-triggered insight.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interiority is rich and specific: his mix of cosmic dread, wry self-awareness (“philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms”), and compulsive need to understand the loop feels coherent. Motivation is cleanly rooted in bewilderment plus a curator’s quasi-professional responsibility. The final choice—to carve his present fear to close the loop—reads as an earned stance rather than a sudden epiphany. Internal contradiction (terror of causality vs hunger for forbidden knowledge) is present but could be dramatized with one more concrete moment of hesitation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are crisply defined and her choices (conserving magic, bargaining via taxonomy) are consistent and revealing, especially at the golem gate. However, we get very little embodied emotional texture or contradiction in her under pressure—she reads as assured more than strained. The Time Traveler functions mostly as a symbol of regret rather than a fully realized person, though his aging and line “I missed the gaps in the silence” hint at depth. The rescue does not significantly alter their relationship on the page, so the emotional cost of her success feels more thematic than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharply defined—seeking the Garden to externalize her absorbed twin—and her internal contradiction (craving separation vs deepening affection for the “presence in her blood”) plays through the whole piece. Embodied details like the “second heartbeat thrumming phantom-like beneath her own ribs” keep her from feeling abstract. Her final renunciation of the fantasy of a separate sister and acceptance of shared embodiment feels earned by prior beats. The only slight limitation is that we see essentially one emotional register of her (haunted/lyrical); no flash of pettiness or resistance roughens the edges.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation and professional identity are clear and specific—an “adaptable archivist” who organizes reality itself—but his inner life remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. We understand what drives him, yet we rarely feel contradictory impulses or genuine doubt while he works. His competence borders on the frictionless, so the final satisfaction (“a job well done”) lacks an accompanying sense of cost or moral tension. Still, his actions are consistent and his worldview coherently informs each choice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation (preserve her mind, “find the quiet”) is clear and embodied in her trained, methodical responses under pressure, and her professional specificity as a mapkeeper feels lived-in. Her competence and desperation are well-balanced—she’s not invulnerable, but she has tools and knowledge that matter. Internal contradiction is subtler: we get endurance and fear, but not a deep clash of impulses beyond “terror vs focus,” which keeps this just shy of truly layered interior conflict. The final earned stasis—resting in the absolute quiet—feels motivated and paid for but emotionally remains relatively singular.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core drive—to prove that coincidences have meaning by rekindling the beacon—is clear, consistent, and tightly wired to her actions. The retrocognition “blessed/cursed” tension adds a touch of contradiction, especially in the way she overlays her hands on the ghosts of the past. However, her internal conflict under immediate pressure is relatively light; she rarely feels genuinely torn, more simply determined. The ending stance feels earned but could deepen with a clearer sense of what this victory costs her beyond exhaustion and tears.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and textured—her “preemptive nostalgia” and sense of burden feel particular rather than generic, and her role as archivist grounds her perceptions. Her realization that they are “guardians keeping the flame alive” is motivated by the concrete ritual of the shadow-reading and the chorus of voices. The internal shift from anxious observer to resolved custodian is credible Earned Stasis, though the conflict is primarily contemplative rather than sharply riven by contradictory impulses in-scene. A touch more on-the-page friction between her fear and her duty in the measuring sequence could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian is vivid, competent, and idiosyncratic (the chanting, circus past, ambient awareness), and his motive to bring hope is clear and embodied in his craft. However, he encounters almost no real internal conflict or doubt, and his feelings under pressure are implied rather than explored. The result is a compelling figure, but more icon than fully complicated person. The ending choice to simply move on reads more as archetypal pattern than a costly personal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her tactile relationship with the jade cicada, her sideways attention to the tide pool, and her framing of this moment as a “molting” all feel character-particular. Her choice to release Kael instead of arguing is well-motivated by decades of tidal observation. However, her internal conflict is somewhat smoothed over; we glimpse cost in the imagined lonely years but don’t feel much simultaneous pull toward anger or clinging in the moment. Kael remains mostly a projection (“defiance and guilt”) rather than a full presence, which limits the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s paradox—claustrophobic yet drawn to dangerous altitude—feels psychologically specific and motivates her presence on the trellis. Her bunker childhood and her father’s terror are sketched efficiently and color every choice. In-scene, though, she mostly enacts a single, resolved intention rather than dramatizing live internal contradiction or ambivalence. The final stance (harvesting an “antidote” to memory) is earned but could cut deeper if a competing impulse (e.g., loyalty to the bunker’s safety) surfaced under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s motivation—to safeguard passengers and gently retrain their relationship to silence—is clear, specific, and expressed through concrete action with the storm glass. Kael is more of a reactive figure, but her embodied fear and gradual easing give the scene emotional stakes. Internal contradiction in Elian (duty vs. almost mystical caregiving) is implied but not deeply dramatized under pressure. The ending change in their dynamic is credible yet relatively low-cost, keeping this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s goal and role as Lore Keeper are clear and consistent, and her cautious competence under pressure feels grounded, but there is little true internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page. “Her nature wisely adventurous” is a label more than a dramatized trait, and her emotions stay mostly implied through action rather than embodied. The final transition from Lore Keeper to ruler is conceptually strong but pays only a light emotional cost in-scene. The piece would benefit from one sharp moment where fear, duty, and ambition visibly clash.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation—self-erasure for survival, then terror of emptiness—is clear and consistently dramatized, especially in her clinging to the ring as “proof” and anchor. Her internal contradiction (needing to leave vs needing a relic of what she left) plays cleanly through to the final act of release. Elian’s function as a scarred, non-intrusive guide is specific and his restraint (no logic, no comfort, no touch) makes him feel like more than a device. The one minor limitation is that Mara’s history and flaws are mostly summarized rather than allowed to surface through varied present-tense behaviors.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—his MLM trauma and desire to “translate pressure into diamonds” credibly drive his choice to stand and take the hit. Interiority is textured (“virtuously mischievous” is borne out by his tactic) and embodied enough through physical strain. What’s missing for the very top tier is a sharper sense of contradiction or internal conflict in the peak moment; he never really wavers. The final choice is earned but emotionally a touch straightforward for elite-level character work.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is crystal clear and specific—end the dynasty by exposing the lie—and his actions under pressure align well with that goal. His interiority is particular (the focus on rhythm, bone-deep hum, and irony of a “delicate, rhythmic touch” toppling an empire) rather than generic. However, we get limited contradiction or moral complexity; he never seriously wavers or reveals blind spots, so the arc is more execution than internal struggle. The cost to him personally (fear, potential punishment) remains largely implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Valerius’s core motivation—to seize “the shape of possibility” and escape his tragic history—is clear, distinctive, and consistently drives his choices. Interiority is present but somewhat generalized; we see his solitude and fixation more through setting and action than through sharply particular thought patterns. The crucial renunciation of his old vows is thematically strong but emotionally under-detailed, with little felt tug-of-war on the page. His final transformation is earned in concept, but the internal conflict leading into it could be more vividly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn: a meticulous, emotionally eroded archivist whose need to find evidence of care feels particular and grounded in his work. His motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" cleanly drives every choice, from reading the dust to composing the addendum. Internal contradiction (despair vs. insistence on hope) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment hesitation. A slightly more embodied, in-scene struggle over how boldly to frame the addendum could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she’s driven by the need to restore truth and combat apathy—and her tactics (not running, using age to be ignored, reading puddles) align with that. However, her interiority stays relatively archetypal; we don’t see contradictory impulses or deep emotional texture under pressure so much as a steady, stoic competence. The story suggests cost through her age, fear, and physical risk but doesn’t linger in her embodied experience of them. The final stance (quiet, enduring defiance) feels earned but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular (“a guardian from an order that understood that sound could not only describe the world but also dismantle it”), and his physical cost and ritual fatigue land at the end. However, his interiority is mostly a single, steady note of grim duty and nostalgia; we see little in-scene contradiction or moral friction. His competence is never really in doubt, so his struggle reads more functional than truly fraught. The cyclical burden is evocative but could be deepened with more idiosyncratic thought or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s reverent, meticulous nature is clearly and consistently drawn, and his motivation—to honor and decode the trees’ message—is legible and specific. His profession and ritual practice feel character-particular rather than generic fantasy druidry. However, there is little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; he never seriously wavers or risks error. The ending registers more as satisfaction than a costly or ambiguous shift in his internal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation (fixing broken clocks vs. seeking the compass) is coherent and organically escalates into a willingness to risk his life. The internal contradiction—“desire to freeze time” versus “befriend uncertainty”—is clear and plays directly into his final stance. Embodied stress shows in details like trembling hands, frantic digging, and physical struggle on the rock. The shift at the end toward exhilarated acceptance of risk is earned, though the realization is stated somewhat explicitly instead of more fully dramatized through conflicted internal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to make visible, and thus bearable, the “weight of names” that destroyed Julian—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through her choices in the foundry. Her interiority is particular (equations of the universe, phonetic vibrations as gravity) and she reads as a disciplined, austere mind rather than a stock mourner. However, internal contradiction is muted; her luminous regret never truly clashes with doubt or selfishness, so the emotional range narrows. The final acceptance of Julian’s “fracture” is earned but feels more like an extension than a hard-won reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s role and disposition are clearly established—his modest fearlessness, methodical calm, and unusual healing motive—but his interior conflict remains relatively light for such charged work. Thorne is efficiently sketched through dignity, vanity, and his reaction to the tooth, giving him a distinct emotional pivot. The shift from shame to laughter feels motivated by the specific memory, not generic absolution. A deeper sense of what this costs Elian personally (beyond professional satisfaction) would push characterization higher.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and particular—his proprioceptive torment, trauma reflexes, and cold drive to “discover the mathematics of mercy” all cohere into a distinct psyche. The trauma-driven navigation (shins aching before a drop-off, neck stiffening before thorns) grounds him as a lived, damaged body rather than an abstract sufferer. The final endurance in the beam feels motivated by his need to reframe pain, not a sudden epiphany. Emotional contradiction (terror vs. compulsion toward greater pain) is present and credible, though the “equation” goal stays a bit conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his work with the painting, and his acceptance of the psychic burden at the end feels earned. However, he is largely free of contradiction or moral complication; we don’t see impulses that truly pull against his calling. Emotional response is mostly filtered through atmosphere rather than sharply embodied internal conflict. This makes him persuasive but not yet as fully dimensional or pressured as top-tier literary characters.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and competency are clear and particular—“to discover what ceilings hide” plus his unusual niche gives him specificity. His emotional life is mostly implied through sensations like the “weightless burden” rather than dramatized conflict, so we don’t see much contradiction or cost. Micro-choices (waiting for the environment to shift, choosing dust analysis over tools) reveal character effectively. The ending doesn’t register a strong internal shift; he finishes a job more than he changes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s core motivation—rejecting negotiable reality to “compress eternity into a moment”—is clear, consistent, and drives every action, but his interior life is more conceptual than emotionally embodied. He reads as a strong, coherent archetype rather than a fully contradictory, living psyche. The lack of real hesitation or competing impulse in the destruction beat slightly flattens potential complexity. Still, the occupational and ideological specificity (forbidden lead, letterpress craft) gives him distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian is vivid and specific: the mix of “defunct revolutionary” and aesthetic mystic gives his choices weight, and the shard tactic clearly arises from his refusal to let history serve tyranny. His emotional state (“burnished sorrow”) is convincingly embodied rather than labeled. Internal contradiction—wanting to win the dispute yet knowing he is fabricating—is present but could be sharpened into more explicit on-page tension at the climax. Thorne functions mostly as a foil; his own motives and interiority remain thin but adequate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and competence are clear and specific to him as a music box repairman, with nice touches like his fear of the stone and the way he steels his mind against doubt. Interiority is present but somewhat generalized; we get conviction and fear but not many sharply idiosyncratic thoughts or contradictions under pressure. His choice to “mend what isn’t torn” and to affirm “I am a mender” is well motivated by prior setup. The emotional cost is mostly fatigue and strain rather than a deeper, more complex internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas’s vocation and obsessive care for his sense of smell give him a vivid, particular interiority, and his motivation—to reach the place where explanations fail—is clear and consistent. However, he experiences little on-page internal conflict or contradiction; his drive never meaningfully strains against fear, doubt, or competing values. His micro-choices (using psychometry, descending further, pouring the vial) all align with a single, unchallenged compulsion. The final “change” is more about attainment than an earned shift in character stance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is sharply etched as a competent, idiosyncratic artist whose worldview and skills clearly motivate her response to the crisis. Her philosophy (“timewoven alliances,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”) aligns with concrete choices like repurposing the sculpture. However, we see little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she moves from call to solution without much emotional friction. The result is compelling and coherent, but not yet psychologically deep enough for top-tier literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand night-blooming flowers—clearly drives every choice, from abandoning lucrative commissions to building the apparatus and waiting three nights. Her inner shift from vanity to humility (“her art had always been about vanity…”) is thematically aligned and earned by what she witnesses. Emotional states are embodied through her obsessive focus and tears rather than labels. The main limitation is that her internal conflict could surface more as contradiction-in-the-moment rather than largely as a realized conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a civil-rights archivist is clear and consistent, and her key choice—promising “WITNESS” instead of simply demanding the key—feels earned. Emotional embodiment via heat, evaporating tears, and the oppressive view works well, but her inner conflict remains relatively simple and uncontradicted. The Scribe’s motivation (legacy in exchange for release) is sharp but thinly developed beyond that single axis. Overall, the characters are credible and purposeful, but lack the layered ambivalence expected at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and coherent—her contempt for oblivious comfort and drive to create a flawed, real society clearly power every choice. The mental strain sequence (“pushed to its absolute biological limit”) gives embodied emotion and specific struggle rather than vague angst. However, internal conflict is thin: she never seriously wavers or reveals contradictory impulses, so the final act feels intense but not morally or psychologically fraught. Phrases like “She inherently rejects false comfort” lean on label rather than dramatized contradiction, slightly flattening the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vane’s vocation, age, and obsessive archival drive are clear and particular, and his panic-then-resolution around the wax shaving feels grounded in that identity. His emotions are embodied (trembling hands, hammering heart) and not merely labeled. Internal conflict is present but relatively simple—duty and curiosity versus fear—without deeper contradiction or moral tangle. The final choice to record the tower’s “final entry” is earned but could carry sharper on-page cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s vocation, competence, and metaphysical curiosity are vividly particular, and his motives (saving the vault vs. wanting to feel “borrowed time”) are clear and interesting. However, the internal conflict between duty and that deeper, almost illicit curiosity is mostly stated rather than forced into a painful choice on the page. His “furiously tranquil” stance is evocative but never really costs him anything. The closing pea-in-hand beat delivers a subtle internal shift, but the price of that shift remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s inner conflict between professional duty and reverence for silence is clearly and consistently motivated, and his final refusal feels earned by the build-up of observations and unease. His profession and tactile engagement with tools (sensor casing, rope, switches) reveal character without exposition. The cost—risk to his job and reputation—is present but could be shaded more viscerally in his body and thought at the climax. Overall he reads specific and principled, if slightly more thematic than messily human.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific—she’s not just a cleaner but a “custodian of mysteries,” and her ritual with the meteor is strongly motivated. The interiority is vivid and embodied (the shard against her eye, her palm on the glass), but her internal conflict remains fairly one-directional: she feels small → she seeks reassurance, with little real contradiction or resistance on the page. The “lesson” she takes from the meteor reads somewhat tidy and untroubled, with limited sense of cost or lingering doubt. Still, her choices under pressure (to stop working, to ritualize the meteor’s death, to reinterpret the dust) credibly reshape her stance by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to restore the covenant of secrecy between living and dead—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized in his ritual refusal to listen. His interiority comes through via perception rather than explicit thought, which suits his temperament and supports the earned-stasis ending. However, his internal conflict is minimal; he never seriously wavers or pays a personally felt emotional price for denying the ghosts. The result is a strong, coherent character portrait with limited dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation and vocation are clear and particular, and her reactions to the urn shard are embodied and specific (“her skin hummed with the static of a life that was not technically hers”). The arc from precarious, borrowed-time existence to a new resolve grounded in death’s fixity feels earned. However, we get more stated obsession than dramatized internal conflict; contradictory impulses under pressure are gestured at rather than fully textured in scene. With no other on-page character, relational pressure and value-testing are necessarily limited.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation and ethos are clear and consistent, especially in his reverent handling of the broken quill and his acceptance of the kite’s loss. His choice at the climax—to incorporate the disruption rather than fix it—feels well motivated by prior description. However, we get almost no contradictory impulses or real struggle on the page; the “threatened to unravel” moment resolves very quickly. The characterization is strong but stops short of the deep, conflicted interiority that would push this into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent from the oncologist’s office through his final walk of the perimeter, and his choices are all legibly rooted in that goal. The “brazen calm” with which he treats a terminal prognosis and his methodical work style create a distinct personality. However, internal contradiction is relatively light: he never truly wavers, doubts, or behaves in ways that surprise us beyond the initial shrug. The arc is more about endurance than a shifted self-understanding, which limits emotional complexity at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives—skeptical, data-driven, academically rebellious—are consistently dramatized in her route choice, attention to footprints, and ultimate rejection of the pilgrimage. Her emotional detachment cracks in embodied ways (light pulsing faster, heart hammering), giving her a specific interior life. The tension between her clinical stance and her vulnerability to the “pull” reads credibly. Aris is more lightly sketched but functions well as a crucible for her beliefs in the confrontation at the parapet.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas’s motivation—“singular and obsessive”—is vivid and consistent, and his ritualistic actions align cleanly with it. However, he faces no on-page resistance and experiences almost no contradiction or doubt, so we learn little about his limits or flaws under pressure. His interiority is mostly descriptive and conceptual rather than emotionally particular, which keeps him from feeling fully individuated. The ending offers endurance rather than change, but with minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s grief, history as a “bloodhound,” and obsessive patience produce a clear, compelling interior life, and his actions (visual “listening,” preserving the leaf, aligning it with the grooves) follow cleanly from who he is. The personal code shared with his lost lover gives the decoding sequence emotional charge rather than mere puzzle-solving. However, we see little on-page contradiction or real-time conflict in his psyche—his need is intense but never meaningfully opposed, so his final rest feels more like confirmation than a costly shift. A slightly stronger sense of what he risks (or could lose) by hoping again would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—clinging to a ritual to stave off cosmic terror, then reorienting toward exploration—is clear, specific, and rooted in her history with her father and the station. Her fear and panic are embodied (trembling charcoal, throat tightness) and credibly coexist with stubborn resolve. The final choice to “map the singularity” is earned by the glimpse and by the compass motif, foreclosing a safer path of passive endurance. Internal contradiction could be pushed slightly further—her survivor’s guilt and self-preservation remain more implied than dramatized—but the arc still feels robust for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motive and worldview are clear and consistent—“a chivalrous thief…who stole only what was necessary to keep the world turning”—and his choices cleanly align with that ethos. However, there is little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; he’s serenely certain from start to finish. His emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied under pressure, so we don’t see his psyche fray or complicate when the sky roars and the world changes. As a result, he reads vivid but somewhat one-note rather than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s crisis-actor past, his numb professionalism, and his new vocation as “historian of small gestures” give him a distinct, specific psychology. His benevolent ruthlessness is dramatized (translating a mother’s sob into dust-letters) rather than told, and his choices track cleanly with that ethic. The internal conflict between empathy and detachment is more implied than fully dramatized in-scene, but it’s present and credible. The ending offers a quiet endurance rather than a sharp pivot, but it feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—“to understand the shape of home” while fleeing unbearable memory—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to risk using her buried abilities. Her fear of her own power and dependency on nightly escapism give her a believable internal contradiction, even if we only glimpse the details of past trauma. Interiority is filtered through image rather than label, which keeps her from feeling generic. The final stance shift—embracing her power to stabilize the mountain—is earned by the prior setup of her avoidance and dread.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s guilt, history as a ruthless tutor, and desire for atonement are sharply drawn and clearly motivate his decision to end the stasis. The link between his strategic mind and his present problem-solving (puzzle → tapestry) gives him specificity. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told the guilt and the need to forgive himself more than we feel competing impulses in the moment of action. His final choice is credible and earned, but emotionally could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to fracture a scapegoating narrative into complexity—is clear, consistent, and drives his choices from first interruption to final acceptance of punishment. His playful, trickster stance reads specific and embodied (swinging legs, soft tenor, mischievous grin) rather than generic rebel. The Elders are sketched as a collective force more than individuals, but that suits the length and focus. The main limitation is the lack of visible internal contradiction in Kaelen under pressure; he never visibly wavers, which trims some potential depth.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s fear, paralysis, and desperate need to make her work matter are vivid and consistent, and her shift from uncertainty to a hard, terminal certainty at the end feels earned. The contrast between her trembling indecision and the ruthless choice to finish the ritual while drowning gives her interiority real torque. Her lineage-specific ability to “quilt memories” personalizes the magic as an extension of her psyche rather than a neutral spell. There’s a slight tilt toward stated abstraction (“Her motivation was singular and desperate…”) where a bit more embodied contradiction in the opening could deepen her further.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, artistic temperament, and ritual impulse are rendered with specificity and credible interior logic, and his micro-choices (bringing the easel, choosing what to paint, releasing the shell) track cleanly to that motivation. The contradiction between wanting to preserve Elara and choosing an object meant to be erased gives him dimensionality. However, his “intimately aloof” nature is told rather than meaningfully pressured on the page, so we don’t see him actively torn between human connection and retreat in this scene. The emotional progression is persuasive but somewhat linear, with little on-page resistance to his chosen course.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation—both to save the ship and to prove “whispers travel farther than shouts”—is clear, specific, and drives his choices. His “screaming tenderness” is embodied in physical sensation and effort, not just labeled. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized on the page; he doesn’t seriously waver or risk a wrong move, which slightly limits depth. The head keeper is one-note but functions adequately as a doctrinal foil.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara is vivid and particular—her burns, “patchwork” profession, and scavenged relics all concretize a psyche shaped by surviving disaster and tending to others’ losses. Her motivation to “navigate the geography of loss” is clear and enacted in choices like staying on station, using a sacred object as a tool, and enduring the emotional resonance of the ghosts. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; she mostly reads as serenely committed rather than being pulled between competing impulses in scene. The final earned stasis—accepting the ongoing burden and waiting for the moon to wane—lands, but could cut deeper if a live alternative (escape, refusal) were made more temptingly present.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivations are clear and particular—his rationalism under siege by the empathy virus and his curse of involuntary truth make his retreat and turn to “bad science” feel earned. The interiority is textured (“treated them like chemical formulas, demanding they react”) and embodied through sensory overload and relief. Internal contradiction (skeptic vs. desperate believer) is present but could be sharpened under peak pressure. The final “I am the king of this orchard” nicely crystallizes a change, though the cost of that change remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply etched as an eccentric, solitary keeper whose need for borrowed memories to feel human is specific and persuasive. His motivation to decode the stranger’s final gesture is clear and carries through to the end, with his decision to enshrine the flower reading as an earned, character-consistent response. The interiority is vivid but leans more toward a single, coherent drive than contradictory impulses under pressure, so his arc feels more like a deepening than a truly conflicted struggle. Still, the final revaluation of his lighthouse’s purpose lands as a credible inner shift with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief, profession, and empirically intuitive nature all feed his on-page choices, and his desperation to revisit the “crossroads” is convincing. The tension between wanting to undo the past and needing to face the decision point is clear and active. The shift at the end—accepting that the promise is about courage rather than revision—is emotionally legible and earned. The only softness is that realization being stated a bit directly rather than fully dramatized in embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Isolde’s disenchantment and dream-driven compulsion are clear and specific, and her mix of awe and fatalism in the grotto feels character-rooted rather than generic. The physical struggle on the climb and her refusal to indulge Valerius’s fear show her priorities under pressure. Internal contradiction (terror vs attraction to annihilation; duty as queen vs new stewardship role) is present but could be pushed further on the page. Valerius works as a secondary pressure source, though his dynamic with her remains fairly simple.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s motivation is precise and convincing, rooted in his vocation and philosophy, and his choice to use the shock of Kaelen’s departure to complete the experiment sharpens his complexity. The relationship dynamic is clear and affecting, though Kaelen remains more symbolic than fully dimensional. The subtle moral compromise—instrumentalizing an intimate wound to achieve a sublime object—could be foregrounded a touch more in his interiority. Overall, characterization is rich and emotionally legible with only minor underdevelopment on Kaelen’s side.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The interiority is vivid and particular, with “feral nostalgia” and jealousy of past selves giving the narrator a distinct, flawed psychology. Motivation (to anchor himself through documenting dreams) is clear and consistent with the grave revelation. Contradictory impulses—yearning to escape into flight vs. grimly forcing himself to write—are present but could be sharpened into a more explicit, costly choice. Overall, the character feels specific and lived-in, if slightly more conceptual than embodied at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply rendered: the anosmic ex-aromatherapist whose observational skills have rerouted into reading micro-tension feels specific and embodied, and his choice to offer the heirloom screw arises cleanly from that history. Kael’s anxiety about obsolescence is legible through behavior and subtext rather than label alone, and the relationship shifts in a credible, understated way. Internal contradiction (loss vs. new “mapping,” healer vs. scavenger of relics) is present if not deeply stressed. A bit of diagnostic phrasing (“deep, vibrating anxiety,” “quiet motivation to unveil ordinary miracles”) flattens some complexity but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s fear, training, and strange affliction interlock into a coherent psychology: the scholar who knows the theory but can’t regulate her body under pressure. Her motivation (“transform scars into stories”) pays off concretely when the shed crystals become inscribed artifacts of survival. The internal contradiction between academic logic and childish superstition drives her key choice in a believable way. A few motivation statements skew a bit declarative, but the emotional throughline under stress remains specific and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply drawn—a weary professional who couches brutal truths in metaphors—and Elena’s guilt motive is clear and specific, though her interiority remains comparatively thin. His mix of cynicism and care comes through in choices like cutting the power despite her desperation. Emotional contradiction is present but not deeply mined; we glimpse, rather than inhabit, Silas’s hollow ache. The father’s brief manifestation is effective but more emblem than character, which slightly limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to hold reality together by perceiving truth—reads clearly and consistently, and her reliance on a cheap dictionary is a strong, character-specific touch. However, she functions more as an archetypal Witness than as a fully individuated person with particular history or contradictions. Her internal conflict with the lure of “comfortable nothingness” is stated but not deeply dramatized in layered, contradictory impulses. The endurance at the end (“one more cycle”) carries conceptual cost, but the emotional cost could be more embodied and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s obsession with “what clocks really measure” is specific, credible, and drives every micro-choice, from the trance counting to risking the key. Interiority is textured and embodied (“forced his heartbeat to decelerate”), with a clear flaw—intellectual hubris—that directly leads to his entrapment in the mechanism. Internal conflict is present but a bit underdeveloped; once the horror begins, he mostly wants to escape rather than wrestle with any competing impulse to keep looking. The final renunciation via the leap to zero reads earned and costly, but the emotional aftermath could deepen slightly beyond conceptual horror to push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and specific—his fixation on geometry, boundaries, and spores grounds his conflict, and the final choice to override the locks feels motivated by the accumulated pressure. His history of “building walls” is slightly summarized rather than dramatized, but still supports the pivot. The relationship with Mera is underdeveloped in her half (she remains mostly a silhouette), yet their dynamic as “familiar strangers” credibly reconfigures at the end. The cost of his choice to her and to the larger operation is more implied than felt, which keeps the emotional change just shy of fully piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is sharply drawn—probability professor, gambler’s daughter, post–heart attack—with a coherent, particular interiority. Her motivation to test a dangerous hypothesis feels rooted in both professional training and family history. However, internal conflict is more described than dramatized; she moves from curiosity to peace with little visible struggle or self-sabotage on the page. The closing acceptance is credible but comes a touch too smoothly to feel fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply etched through his ritualized work, tools, and philosophy, but we get very little interior contradiction or on-page emotional struggle—his motivation is largely summarized in the final paragraph. The callers are sketched with efficient specificity (tears and red wine; late wife’s number) and feel human despite minimal page time. His micro-choices—matching pitch, routing to Line Four, deciding when to break the loop—are clear and aligned with his stated philosophy. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a moment where his own loneliness or doubt complicates his procedures and exacts a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply etched—a widow-archivist whose walnut-stained hands, ritual precision, and fixation on “small moments” feel specific and lived-in. Her motivation to preserve a single laugh instead of grand history is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction (grief versus duty, desire to hold on versus to release) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in hard choices. The final shift from “widow of time” to “guardian” is earned, though the cost could be pushed more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arthur’s characterization is vivid and coherent: the hyper-competent logistician whose “ultimate connection” mindset and desperately jocular defense mechanisms make his final choice to discard the rock feel earned and costly. His interior contradiction—master of moving things yet immobilized by loneliness—is dramatized rather than labeled. The interaction with the violinist exposes his flaw (treating intimacy as barter) and forces a believable shift toward vulnerability. The only slight limit is that the woman remains more emblematic than fully individuated, which makes the relationship beat lean a bit toward parable.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (seeking her father’s final message/closure) is clear and coherently drives every action. Her emotional life has some texture—panic vs. trust in the ring, grief vs. determination—though contradictions are more stated than deeply dramatized. The cost of the journey (emotional pain, risk of losing the narrow window) is legible and tied to her particular abilities and history. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper, more idiosyncratic flaw or blind spot that complicates her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and specific—the “imposter in his own life” who still acts with “absolute precision” gives him a credible, textured psyche. His motivation (atoning for misread signals and “planting the wrong seeds”) is clear and consistently drives his choices. However, his internal conflict rarely bites into action; doubt never meaningfully impedes or distorts what he does, so his change by the end reads more as completion of a task than a costly shift. The emotions tend to stay at the level of grand, lyrical statement rather than embodied strain.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (“to translate silence into music” within a liminal hour where he’s forgotten) is clear and consistent, and the “joyful sorrow” of anonymity gives him a distinct inner texture. The advisor functions as a pressure source and collaborator, though her interiority is absent and she reads more as an archetypal guide than a full character. Internal contradiction (liberation vs. loss) is thematically strong but not heavily tested by any hard choice; he never truly risks abandoning or failing the work. The emotional peak—his weeping at the end—feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (protecting dangerous truth, honoring a promise to Kael) is clear and consistent, and her “volcanic tenderness” gives her interiority specificity. Her analytical perception of art and her arsonist past both shape her choices in a way that feels grounded. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—she moves through the piece with high competence and relatively little on-page struggle or genuine mistake. The final choice to reframe rather than restore the portrait is earned but could carry more visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation—trading his sanity to be with Lena—is clear, consistent, and drives every action. His interiority is vivid in sensory terms (vibrations through his bones, the taste of ozone and old tears) but shows little true contradiction or hesitation; he feels almost serenely committed rather than torn. The relationship with Lena is emotionally present but mostly idealized, with limited concrete shared history beyond the lagoon image. The final renunciation of the physical world is earned, yet it comes without much visible last-second doubt or competing value on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply defined—competent, patient, quietly ideological—and his tactics consistently reflect his belief in subtlety; Kael’s brashness is a clear foil. Motivation (proving whispers vs shouts) is clear and drives all major choices, including sacrificing Kael by trapping him. However, Elias’s inner conflict is minimal; we don’t see contradictory impulses or cost beyond an abstract point-proving, which keeps the emotional arc somewhat cool. The relationship dynamic is strong but stays schematic (teacher vs noisy pupil) rather than fully humanized.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply etched through behavior (turning away from the words to work the lantern) and a coherent governing trait of silent empathy; the woman is thinner, mostly a function of her guilt and eventual realization. Motivation is legible and consistent, and the final “nod” reads as an earned, quiet acknowledgment. The main weakness is that her shift from crushing guilt to “finally understood” veers toward an unearned speed and neatness given how little of her inner life we see. More contradiction or cost in her realization would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation is vivid and consistent—using chess to reintroduce hesitation—and his choices (leading the children below, signaling the shutters) align cleanly with that goal. Interiority is present but somewhat narrated-from-above rather than embodied; we’re told his gift is “burdensome” more than we feel its cost in specific moments. The children function as a collective rather than individuals, so relationship pressure is mostly abstract. The final realization about “the loudest revolution” grows plausibly from his earlier stance, though his internal conflict remains relatively muted.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian and Vane both have clear, coherent motives under pressure—Elian’s insistence on leaving and Vane’s terror of boundarylessness are well grounded, and the dockside struggle makes their traits visible in action. The scrimshaw-triggered revelation that Vane clings to geometry and rigidity is specific enough to feel character-based, not generic. However, Elian’s interiority and contradiction are only lightly sketched; he functions more as a calm savior than as a fully conflicted individual, which slightly softens the cost of his choice. The relationship does shift—from physical opposition to guided surrender—but mostly along expected lines.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation—to survive by anesthetizing his grief—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices. The moral compromise of “selling out his past to purchase his safety” gives him credible ambiguity rather than stock dystopian victimhood. We see both his performative excess (the announcer persona) and his cultivated inner emptiness, which creates a live contradiction. A touch more embodied, less abstract emotion (beyond “emotional void”) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s aesthetic, transgressive motivation is clear and specific, and her interiority is embodied (“rattled her teeth,” hairs standing) rather than abstract. However, internal conflict is muted: the danger of her technique is asserted but never meaningfully troubles her or complicates her choices in scene. The final realization that “the separation had never been real” feels earned but comes without visible cost beyond awe. This makes her arc compelling but not yet at the ruthless, pressure-tested depth expected at a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, particular, and intriguingly amoral—she resurrects Silas for his sorrow, not his person—and her actions (the plant bargaining, insisting on rust as “necessary texture”) all align with that. Interiority is mostly implied through perception rather than explicit thought, but it still feels specific to her sensibility as a colorblind artist in a bleached world. Internal conflict is minimal; she never really doubts the ethics of what she’s doing, which keeps the arc a bit flatter than it could be. The Glassblower is vivid as a presence but largely a fixed obstacle rather than a dynamically pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—her dissatisfaction with mere performance credibly drives her to risk breaking the “rules” of her instrument. Her interiority has some texture (“hollow ache,” longing for the “texture of connection”) but rarely shows truly contradictory impulses in scene. Kael is thinner but functional, serving mainly as catalyst and emotional mirror. The final change—her discovery that sound can become touch—feels earned by her prior dissatisfaction rather than a bolt from nowhere.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched—a withdrawn, devout craftsman whose grief has hardened into a vocation—and the woman’s body language around the box is precise and believable. Motivation is clear on both sides (his to “teach withering to bloom,” hers to resolve the aborted tattoo), and their actions track those motives. However, the woman remains more emblematic than individuated, with little contradictory interiority under pressure beyond the stated fear of permanence. The emotional arc at the end is credible but relatively streamlined, with limited on-page ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas is sharply drawn—his ink-stained hands, draftsman’s precision, and stance as “reverse engineer” of fate read as specific, not generic mystic. His core tension (professional detachment vs. moral obligation to reveal the “engineered demolition”) is credible and drives the final turn. The client exists mostly as a foil and never quite registers as a full character, which limits relational pressure. The emotional aftermath of Silas’s realization is more told than embodied, slightly flattening the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she’s a historian willing to risk psychic entrapment to uncover censored truth—and the final renunciation of her faith in the Council feels earned. Her emotions are embodied (“hands trembling,” “laughed and sobbed simultaneously”) and her peak-state of “anguished joy” is convincing. Internal contradiction exists (hope vs. grief, safety vs. forbidden knowledge) but is gestured at more than fully dramatized; she’s never deeply tempted by the archive’s traps. Still, the before/after in her interior stance is legible with a real cost: the loss of innocence and naive belief.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation as “a custodian of endings” who preserves discarded shadows is clear, specific, and drives every action. His emotional life is convincingly embodied in small choices (carrying the stone from bedrock, moving “softly deliberate”) and the final felt regret. The internal conflict—saving the shadow at the cost of the woman’s wholeness—is present but underplayed; a touch more on his hesitation or guilt in the capture beat could deepen him further. Still, he reads as a distinct, coherent consciousness with credible, costly values.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific, with a clear tension between violated trust and immediate care (“She wanted to rage... but the creature let out a soft, pained hiss that pulled her back”). Her actions under pressure—choosing surgery over pursuit—are well motivated and reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The internal change from naive trust to tempered compassion feels earned through the physical act of cutting away poisoned tissue. A slight tendency toward abstract framing (“bedrock of trust,” “act of reclamation”) keeps this just short of truly exceptional nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s core contradiction—“a closure seeker who opens wounds”—is sharply drawn and concretely dramatized through his choice to dig despite pain and the plants’ pleas. His bodily experience (stitches tearing, breath hitching) grounds the obsession. The final gesture of touching the root and accepting the lullaby reads as an earned shift rather than a tidy epiphany. The only slight limitation is that some self-descriptions verge on declarative rather than discovered in action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is precise and unusual, and her actions (choosing psychometry over projection, incubating the strip, directing the energy) follow cleanly from it. We get an idiosyncratic sensibility rather than a stock mystic. Internal contradiction is relatively light—she moves with ritual certainty more than conflict—so the arc feels more like fulfillment than a fraught choice. Still, the final quiet relief and the acceptance of the strip’s “death” register as an earned, modest-cost shift.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation and flaw (crippling sensitivity to unrealized ideas) are clear and drive every choice, especially his final renunciation of effort. His emotional experience is embodied and specific (“iron in his blood resonating”), not just labeled. The internal shift from frantic striving to surrendered stillness feels earned by the preceding overwhelm. Some phrasing leans toward generalized mythic language rather than idiosyncratic psychology, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s role and motivation are clear and specific—his dreamlessness as both qualification and deprivation is a strong, character-particular choice. His duty and the cost of quantum dispersion are nicely embodied (“He was the guard and the guarded”), but his interior conflict remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses or hesitations. We don’t see micro-choices that test his values beyond endurance of a familiar ritual. The Earned Stasis at the end (he remains the keeper without comfort) is credible but could land harder with one sharper moment of doubt or desire.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and particular—exiled rationalist trying to reclaim a “wild frontier” of mind—and his sixth sense plus exile history feel integrated rather than labeled. Interiority is embodied in sensory terms (wind timbres, bone-deep resonance) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. The main limitation is that his internal conflict is under-pressured: once the turbine appears, his path is mostly straight to success, with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse. The closing shift from fear to acceptance is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The man’s pain at the “snapped tether” and his trembling reluctance to look at his own interior landscape feel embodied and specific, and Elara’s long-practiced empathy reads as grounded in history rather than abstract kindness. His decisive reach into the mist to claim “his own resolved will” is clearly motivated by the preceding journey and her framing of what he left behind. The internal conflict—freedom that hurts, fear versus latent courage—is present but could be sharpened with one or two more idiosyncratic details to distinguish him from any soul-in-transition. Still, the emotional progression from shivering dependence to tentative agency is credible and earns the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s motivation—to understand the cost of safety—is clear, specific, and coherently drives his decisions, especially the final choice to remain as a “contaminant.” His pain, fear, and flickers of hope are embodied through the nerve regeneration and the bolt’s sting, not just labeled. The internal contradiction between craving safety and recognizing its spiritual cost is present on the page and credibly resolved into an earned stance of endurance. Because no other characters are on-page, there’s no relational crucible, but for a solo POV this is rich and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orel’s characterization is vivid and particular—“diminutive titan,” regally unpretentious custodian, heir hiding in plain sight—but his interior conflict is minimal, and he never feels in true doubt or danger. His motivation to expose the Pretender and his choice of subtle, intellectual sabotage are clear and consistent with his density motif. The Pretender is a flat foil defined almost entirely by arrogance and hollowness, which works thematically but limits relational complexity. The final sorrowful watching as the Pretender drifts away hints at cost, yet the emotional price for Orel remains underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—his history as a “coral bleaching witness” credibly fuels his obsession with the vanished road. Interiority is textured (the tapping practice, the torn atlas page) and embodied rather than generic. However, there is little on-page internal contradiction or difficult choice; his arc is primarily a shift in understanding, not a conflicted decision with visible cost. The final realization feels earned but relatively low in personal stakes beyond awe and reframed grief.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and persona—the barefoot stargazer seeking meaning in ruin—are vivid and consistent, and her reverence for the opera glasses and stone circle nicely externalizes her interior. However, her internal conflict is relatively mild: once she commits, there’s little sense of doubt, fear, or competing impulses under pressure. Her choice to look foolish in front of soldiers is promising but underexploited; the social and emotional cost of that defiance doesn’t deepen as the scene escalates. The final “meaning found” moment feels earned enough, but could land harder with sharper dramatization of what failure would mean specifically to her.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her determination to break the Council’s law to “weaponize hope” coherently drives every action. The insurgent grandmother angle gives her a distinct, embodied presence (trembling fingers, spectacles, heat gnawing at her boots). Internal conflict is only lightly sketched (fear/urgency vs purpose); we don’t feel a deep, live contradiction tested on the page. The ending choice feels earned, but the cost to her personally is not deeply explored beyond defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is sharply realized through embodied trauma, deliberate self-regulation, and his quasi-mystical intimacy with plants; the conflict between his body’s urge to dive and his chosen stillness is vivid and specific. His coping tactics (photo, pearl of stillness, somatic cataloging) feel idiosyncratic rather than generic therapy-speak because they’re dramatized in concrete sensory terms. The final endurance—returning to the graft with steady hands—reads as an earned stasis rather than a tidy cure. The only small limitation is that we see him in just one relational vacuum, so facets beyond the trauma-and-work axis remain implied rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular—the analytical loop ruining his art, his tactile engagement with the tarot box, and his ambivalence toward “enlightenment” all feel specific rather than generic. His final decision to descend into darkness is well prepared by his earlier realizations about light as trap and dark as potential canvas. Contradictory impulses (terror vs artistic need, survival vs surrender) are present, though they could grind against each other more explicitly in the peak moment. Overall, the arc from paralysis to chosen descent reads motivated and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivation—to master the mechanics of crisis-time for dominance—is clear, specific, and embodied in his “serene anger” and trained predator mindset, and his final pivot to “track the pattern now, not the man” reads as an earned, character-driven reorientation. The tension between his consciously wild ethos and his reliance on the hated drone gives him a credible internal friction, though this never quite forces a painful trade-off. Kaelen is thinner but still legible: a calm, almost devotional relationship to time and the ink, with his sad smile and controlled escape. The emotional experience remains mostly on the cool/intellectual side, so while consistent and believable, it lacks a deeper contradictory tangle that would fully merit top-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and credibly torn between duty to preservation and desire to shatter a fraudulent peace, and her final choice feels earned by the preceding interior struggle. Her fear, loyalty, and outrage coexist in-scene rather than as neat stages, and her profession meaningfully colors how she frames “freezing” and “thawing” truth. Kael is thinner but still functions as a live pressure, his shock and status legible in a few strokes. The arc lands as an earned stance rather than a tidy epiphany, with visible cost to her loyalties.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—repurposing her father’s lethal focus into pacifist cultivation—is clear and drives her micro-choices, especially the decision to sheathe the knife. The inheritance of violence versus her vow is credibly felt as simultaneous impulses (“phantom inheritance that urged violence”). Embodiment leans a bit abstract at times (hyper-awareness is more told than behaviorally stressed), but the internal conflict is specific and consistent. The stranger is thinly sketched but functions as an effective pressure catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a professional hunter of dangerous sound is clear and consistent, and her competence is well dramatized through tactics like breath control and zigzag movement. However, her inner life remains thin: the “cool-headed fisher” persona dominates without much contradiction, doubt, or morally charged hesitation about commodifying divinity. Emotional embodiment is vivid but largely externalized into the environment rather than deepening her interior conflict. The ending reflects endurance and professionalism more than any visible cost or reconfigured self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor is sharply drawn as an isolated, hyper-rational heiress whose instinct is to analyze rather than emote, and her memorization of ledgers plus the "orbits of regret" diagrams feel character-specific rather than generic quirks. Her motivation to seek truth instead of mere reputation defense is clear and consistent, and her choice to intervene via logic rather than PR fits. What’s missing for a higher score is a stronger sense of internal contradiction or emotional cost—she never really wavers or pays a visible price for her stance. The relationship with Sterling functions more as a foil than a dynamic crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—guilt over a silenced lullaby—is specific, consistent, and tightly braided to every choice she makes at the console. Her past as a constellation tattooist meaningfully shapes her tactics in the climax (“just as she used to connect freckles on skin”), which is a smart, character-grounded move. Internal conflict (terror of reopening the wound vs need for redemption) is present but could be pushed one turn further under peak pressure. Still, the final emotional shift from crushing weight to earned lightness feels well motivated and not saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation (to salvage meaning from vanishing history) is clear and coherently expressed through his decision to come to the grotto and intervene. His perception of the voices as distinct social cues feels character-specific and rooted in his “socially perceptive nature.” The internal conflict between preserving his intricate mandala and “ruining the picture to save the moment” is strong but only lightly probed rather than deeply contested. Emotional experience leans heavily on atmospheric description, with fewer sharply individuated, contradictory impulses than a top-tier score would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    734’s motivation—his “aberrant mercy”—is clear, consistent, and drives each micro-choice from brushing snow off faces to hacking the log, with embodied conflict against lethal protocol. The internal contradiction between designed function and chosen compassion is convincing, though his interiority leans conceptual rather than sensory-emotional at times. The child is thinly characterized but functions adequately as a pressure source. The final acceptance of being “glad to be flawed” feels earned by prior behavior, not a bolt-on revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Barnaby’s motivation is vivid and particular—an encore-hungry ghost who craves applause and channels that into saving Clara—and his synesthetic perceptions give him a distinctive inner life. Clara is sketched efficiently through posture, the coin, and her lineage, but remains more emblematic than fully embodied. The final change in her resolve feels earned by what she experiences. What’s missing for a higher score is richer contradiction or visible cost in Barnaby (he never truly risks or wrestles with competing impulses).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Both Elias and Mara are sharply sketched: his “affectionate skeptic” stance and refusal of the pills cleanly motivate his role as caretaker, while her tremors and inability to “focus” embody her damage. Elias’s choice to guide her through breath and touch instead of words is a strong, character-specific micro-decision. Mara’s internal contradiction—terror at the noise yet longing for connection—is mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized, which slightly limits the emotional peak. The closing posture shift and “willowglass hope” feel earned but could hit harder with a bit more textured access to her inner conflict in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded—her role, solitude, and reliance on the fossil all feel individual rather than generic. Motivation (“to become the voice of the unknown”) is clearly articulated and consistent with her actions. The transitional object gives her a credible vulnerability (risk of “dissolving into the data”), but internal contradiction under pressure is relatively mild; she never comes close to failing or making a costly mistake. The final shift in self-conception (guardian → interpreter) is earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently enacted: he wants to transform a deterministic prophecy into possibility. His competence and ritualistic care feel grounded in his occupation, and his choices (uncorking the jar, selecting and arranging buttons, inverting the master hourglass) all align with that drive. However, his inner life is mostly inferred rather than dramatized—there’s little on-page contradiction, fear, or risk of failure, so the change at the end feels more conceptual than hard-won. A touch more emotional friction under pressure would deepen him from effective functionary to fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation—redeeming himself from branded cowardice—is clear, specific, and drives every on-page choice, from returning to the bluff to using the pillbox as proof. Interiority is concrete and tied to objects (the pillbox, the snow, the erased footprints), not just labels. The internal contradiction between his past refusal of death and present embrace of risk is credible, even if it’s occasionally summarized (“branding of cowardice”) rather than fully dramatized. The final endurance—choosing to live with uncertain status—reads as an earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is distinct and motivated—his role, temperament, and method are clear, and his choices (waiting, intervening, then departing) track cleanly with his purpose. The woman, however, reads more as an elegant construct (“palimpsest promise”) than as a fully individuated person with concrete, contradictory impulses. Her transformation from burdened to serene feels earned within the story’s logic but emotionally tidy, with limited felt cost or resistance. Interiority is more conceptual than embodied, which slightly blunts the impact of the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motives and worldview are clear and particular, and his choices (softening his touch, engaging with the glass, accepting he cannot “fix” the wasteland) track cleanly with that characterization. Interiority is concrete and filtered through his craft, which works very well. The main limitation is that internal conflict remains low-grade and largely implicit; we don’t feel him truly torn between competing impulses so much as serenely discovering. The final “lesson” feels earned but not costly in a sharp way.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated—his shift from tending a dying rose to tending light for the old woman reads coherent and character-specific. “Wistfully pragmatic” is borne out in his acceptance of decay and methodical focus on the mechanism. However, internal contradiction and on-page struggle are fairly muted; he rarely wavers or missteps under pressure. The final endurance choice (accept loss of the rose, commit to engineered care) is earned but emotionally quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief over the Sun-Drinkers and her need to “translate isolation into independence” give her a clear, consistent motivation that drives each choice, especially the decision to use the stone circle. Interiority is concrete and tied to specific sensations (thin air, vibration in her teeth), not just labels. Internal conflict—clinging to the past vs. staking out a sovereign present—is present but could be pushed harder in-scene for greater tension. The final shift from “graveyard” to “witness” feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation and worldview are specific and consistent, and her final realization about integration feels earned from her established longing for connection. Motivation for engaging with the sculpture (to “rejoin the separated halves of a narrative”) is clear and aligned with her ghostwriter role. However, there’s little visible internal conflict or cost—she moves toward the act with minimal resistance, so her shift at the end is more graceful than contested. The voiceless client is conceptually potent but underused on the page as live pressure rather than backstory fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—using hard-won technical cunning to thwart “cosmic tricksters” rather than save humanity out of nobility—and his stress is embodied (trembling hands, sweat, nicotine). However, his interiority is relatively straightforward and competent; we get little contradiction or moral friction beyond fear and urgency. The final cost—exhaustion, temporary reprieve, knowledge they’ll return—is intellectually noted but not deeply felt as a personal wound. Strong, clean characterization, but not yet at the level of layered, self-sabotaging complexity top venues favor.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s mix of professional competence, claustrophobia, and “prudently adventurous” temperament is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to keep playing instead of fleeing. The internal conflict between panic and discipline is credibly embodied in physical reactions (bone-deep vibration, hammering heart, closing walls). Her final collapse over the keys and careful retrieval of the compass point feel like earned aftermath rather than melodrama. The only limitation is that we glimpse just one facet of her beyond the mission and the phobia, so her change reads as situationally intense rather than profoundly life-redefining.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas is sharply etched: the prosopagnosia, forensic-art role, and methodical temperament create a distinctive psychology whose actions (the piercing, the ribbon placement) align with his stated aim to bypass recognition and reach empathy. Miller begins as a skeptical, hardened detective and believably cracks in response to the artwork, giving the scene its visible emotional cost. The internal life is more suggested than deeply conflicted—Silas rarely feels torn or uncertain—which slightly limits complexity. Still, motivations are clear, embodied, and drive the micro-choices of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is specific and consistent—an idealistic, rule-breaking archivist driven to redeem her great-grandfather. Her “nervously confident” state is embodied in physical detail (trembling hand, spongey pressure, tears), not just labeled. Interiority feels character-appropriate and filtered through her map-based worldview, especially in lines like “geography was merely a promise waiting to be kept.” The only ceiling is that her internal conflict and the personal cost of defying the High Archivists are more implied than actively sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas is sharply etched—a hyper-attuned, guilt-haunted technician-musician whose perception and vocation plausibly feed his transformation, and his embodied reactions (trembling bow, raw throat) keep him grounded. The internal shift from obsessive error-tracking to accepting “pixelated amnesty” feels earned by the glitch experience, not arbitrarily declared. However, his motivation “to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” is articulated more as thesis than as conflict-laden desire, and we see relatively few concrete micro-choices under live pressure beyond looking, playing, and deciding to drive on. The lack of a relational crucible limits the depth of contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply etched—highway robber’s son, operations head, collector of dead currencies—and his choices (refusing the sale, defending territory, then enduring the collapse) grow credibly from that background. His perceptive calm is dramatized through tactics rather than just labels. Internal conflict is more inferred than explicitly felt on the page; we don’t fully see him torn between pragmatism and self-sabotage, which keeps this shy of exceptional. Secondary characters (Julian, the predators) remain sketched rather than pressuring him in-scene, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, motive, and method are clear and specific, and her choices (entering the dream, deciding to witness, speaking to heal) align well with those traits. However, she encounters almost no internal resistance or doubt, so we see little genuine contradiction or degradation under stress. Her competence feels a bit too assured, with the healing working on the first try. The cost to her is mostly implied fatigue and solemn duty rather than anything dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and specific—“to discover what mirrors don't show”—and his actions consistently serve that goal, from staying at the lake to deploying the seed. His guarded, warlike serenity is dramatized rather than told, and his competence feels earned. However, internal contradiction is muted: we rarely see simultaneous conflicting impulses or costful doubt under pressure. The closing satisfaction at hearing the confession feels a touch too frictionless emotionally for top-tier literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jaren’s motivation—“to find the intersection of dreams”—is clear and drives every choice, with his “anxious elation” embodied in physical sensations and the pain-cost of linking through scars. The interplay between his jittery hope and genuine terror under pressure feels particular rather than generic. Elara is more archetypal but her decision to help and her exhaustion afterward give her a grounded, limited agency. What’s missing at a top tier is a sharper sense of Jaren’s flaws or contradictions meaningfully altering the outcome rather than merely coloring it.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motivation—to restore Leda’s stolen joy even at personal cost—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his actions, especially the trade of his certainty. His interiority is vivid but somewhat one-note; he rarely hesitates or shows contradictory impulses under pressure. The tenderness of his physical actions (“fiercely gentle precision”) adds a distinctive trait that coheres with his rebellious idealism. A slightly deeper dramatization of doubt or fear in the climax could push this to the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular: an ex-roadie in a silk tie, using technical facts as armor against humiliation, reads as specific and human. His contradictory impulses—craving certainty yet doubting his eye after the forgery—are dramatized in the way he delays committing until he can see the back of the cloth. The final shift to “steward” is earned by what we’ve seen of his reverence for gear, though the explicit statement of his “purpose” edges toward tidy articulation rather than letting the image alone carry it. Kellen functions as a simple but effective pressure source without needing more depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s characterization as a grief-stricken yet intellectually driven translator-physicist is specific and consistent, with his linguistic worldview shaping every choice. His motivation to both save the arbor and understand Aris’s transition is clear and credible. However, internal conflict is relatively muted—there’s little sense that hesitation, anger, or panic ever seriously threaten his chosen course, which slightly softens the emotional cost of his final acceptance. Aris exists mostly in summary rather than as an active relational pressure on the page, limiting the relationship-as-crucible dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s role, temperament, and core value (“to preserve wonder in routine”) are clear and embodied in his careful, unorthodox handling of the soul. However, his internal conflict is only lightly sketched—there’s little sense of genuine risk that he might succumb to apathy or fail, so his small victory feels more graceful than hard-won. The moment of satisfaction in his pneumatic chest is effective but relatively low-cost. Overall he reads vivid and particular, but still slightly more function than fully pressured person.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation, peculiar talent, and worldview are sharply drawn, and his final choice clearly arises from the established tension between professional duty and hoarded despair. The interiority is concrete and character-specific (“acquires abandoned hopes the way a hoarder collects old newspapers”). However, the explicit line “his true motivation was not to secure the perimeter, but to dissolve the walls between hearts” flattens what had been a more nuanced conflict into a stated thesis. The internal struggle at the decision point could carry more contradictory impulse on the page rather than arriving as a clarified moral insight.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is distinctly drawn: a river chronicler whose guilt, unmedicated perception, and obsessive need for an “oracle” motivate each step from lavatory to river. His interiority is concrete and particular (e.g., viewing graffiti as “bathroom graffiti wisdom” rather than vandalism). The final weeping on the bank feels earned by the accumulated pressure of long-avoided guilt. Some additional in-scene contradiction or resistance (hesitation, self-sabotage) under the peak beats could deepen his complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to reach and raid the library) is clear and her competence under pressure feels earned, especially in how she uses the watch and her notebook. The “fragile blend of terror and thrill” is convincing and recurs in her cautious, methodical choices. Internal contradiction is present but mild—her arrogance is flagged as dangerous but never quite manifests in a way that costs her. The final shift (now bearing the burden of the unwritten letter) is resonant but a bit under-costed emotionally for truly top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motives—official duty versus treasonous dream—are clear and consistent, and his embodied responses (“mulberry ache,” teeth-aching hum) make him feel particular rather than generic. The internal conflict is present on the page (duty, fear, longing for wildness), but he moves to decisive action with relatively little on-page hesitation or real sense of personal jeopardy. His profession as a provenance researcher nicely refracts his final choice to “alter provenance,” giving the closing shift credibility. A slightly deeper sense of what he stands to lose—beyond abstract treason—would further richen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are vivid and specific, and her professional identity ("beautician mortician") feels integrated rather than gimmicky. However, internal contradiction and emotional complexity under pressure are underdeveloped—she rarely wavers, doubts, or reveals a cost beyond fatigue. Her choices are clear and aligned with her role, but we don’t see much conflict between personal cost, ethics, or attachment versus her mission. The ending shows her breathless and depleted but not meaningfully reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is rich and specific: her occupational detail, the hairpin backstory, and the tree-climbing habit all feel individual rather than generic. Her motivation and worldview are coherent, and her final realization is clearly rooted in her history of surviving and forgiving. The main limitation is that her present-tense struggle feels relatively frictionless—her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized, so we see less of live contradiction under pressure in the current scene. That softens the felt cost of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias and Vance are sharply etched with clear, specific motives, and Vance’s shift from monolithic certainty to shaken doubt feels earned through the mirror beat. The bodily tremor on the railing and his whispered “What if I am wrong?” give the internal conflict texture rather than label-only feeling. Elias’s “sincerely insincere” mask and professional detachment at the end nicely complicate him, though his own cost remains mostly conceptual rather than felt. A bit more friction or self-contradiction in Elias under pressure could push this toward true top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara and Kael are sharply etched with distinct motives—her quiet custodial urgency versus his grasping ambition—and the backward-aging condition gives her choices a built-in cost. Kael’s shift from “storming” knowledge to letting go is credible and dramatized through the ripple observation rather than told. Internal contradiction is present but mostly one-note (Kael is desperate then enlightened without much resistance or backsliding). The relationship dynamic is clear and evolving, but Kael’s emotional embodiment could go one layer deeper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—to achieve impossible acoustic navigation and finally escape a decades-long trap—is clear and consistently rooted in his identity as a “harmonic stone skimmer.” His competence and patience feel specific and earned, especially in the way he reads the crows and calibrates the throw. The emotional texture skews toward cool mastery rather than conflicted turmoil, so internal contradiction is more implied (endurance vs. desperation) than dramatized. His final shift from total stillness to deliberate walking is a credible, earned change with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to reject neural-linked efficiency and seek “the sacred in the simple”—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices from mist walking to stealing the keystone to shedding the regulatory pack. Her emotions are embodied in the physical strain of the climb and the tactile response to the stone’s warmth. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradictory impulses under peak pressure; she doesn’t seriously waver once committed, so the internal conflict band could be richer for elite-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation—to verify the truth and emotional timbre of a decades-old promise—is clear, specific, and carries through every beat of the story. His tendency to “hide behind truth” is dramatized rather than labeled, especially in how he reframes the dive as “retrieving lost property” and his excuse for preferring the night shift. Internal conflict (dread of what he might find vs. need to know) is present but stays mostly implicit; we don’t see many sharply contradictory impulses in-the-moment, which keeps this just below the top tier. The final change—no longer fearing silence while returning to the same job—is earned and feels like a credible, costly endurance rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Hiero’s role, worldview, and method are sharply defined, and his internal conflict between duty (encoding history) and existential doubt is clear and credible. His micro-choices—casting the coins, tuning the dials, choosing to continue despite fear—align with that motivation. However, his interiority stays somewhat archetypal (“stellar doubt,” “justify the existence of the future”) rather than idiosyncratically personal, which keeps him from feeling fully singular. A touch more specific, character-particular texture to his perceptions or memories would raise this into truly standout territory.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s grief and motivation to “finish her work” are clear, specific, and consistently embodied in the way he handles her tools and responds to her recorded voice. His status as a reaper adds an interesting tension—used to death yet personally hollow—but this contradiction is stated more than it is actively dramatized. The emotional trajectory (from crushing weight to lightened chest) is coherent and earned by his actions. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page clash of impulses (duty vs. refusal to let go) under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s motivation and temperament are clear and particular—the “mage of decidedly lukewarm ability” with “earnestly naive spirit” is a strong, specific premise. His devotion under pressure (the microsecond timing, the threat of psychic shattering) is well-drawn, but internal contradiction is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in competing impulses on the page. He doesn’t significantly change or pay a visible personal cost; the story ends at the moment of success. The characterization is vivid and coherent but lacks a final beat where his flaw or naivete is meaningfully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to reframe the town’s resurfacing as a site of communal meaning rather than garbage or scandal—is clear and consistently expressed through his choices (the photo trail, the apothecary tableau). His interiority is more implied than deeply rendered; we don’t feel strong contradictory impulses or much emotional messiness under pressure. Still, his values and goals read as specific and coherent, and his actions align tightly with them. The endurance/renunciation at the end is quiet but credible: he accepts a solitary, unseen curatorial role with no personal recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner contradiction—rigorous rationalist vs. denied wonder and sentiment—are sharply drawn and drive every choice. Her sentimental attachment to her sister’s ribbon and her conscious decision to silence her analytic mind make the final shift credible. The culminating act (summoning the flame via intuition) feels earned by prior setup. The only minor limitation is that her struggle resolves relatively smoothly once she makes that internal pivot, with little visible cost beyond conceptual risk.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and specific: the tension between his panic and his professional calm, and between transparency and preserving Lyra’s confidence, feels earned and rooted in his role. The “watcher’s burden” manifests in micro-choices like blocking her view and using his own clip. Emotional experience is embodied (“hands shaking,” the feel of the micro-fracture) rather than summarized. The arc is one of costly endurance rather than change, but the cost is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—to reclaim the capacity for emotion—is clear and consistently drives his choices, and the final shockwave of feeling pays this off convincingly. However, his interiority skews conceptual (“data points in a corrupted file”) rather than embodied, and we see little genuine contradiction or erosion under pressure until the very end. Vane is an effective but thin foil, more a mouthpiece for corporate/temporal authority than a fully realized person. The closing change of state (from numbness to feeling) is earned but could carry more felt cost and ambivalence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s profession and mindset are clear and specific, and his receptiveness to the strange coheres with his decision to nurture the seed and repurpose it as an attraction. However, there’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse—he glides from curiosity to solution without much emotional or ethical friction. Embodied emotion appears (nose wrinkling, intensity “bordered on obsession”) but remains relatively muted. The final “choice” feels more like a natural extension of his personality than a pressured turn with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation—atoning for having “silenced them with his moods”—is clear, specific, and drives every action in the tunnel. His internal contradiction between wanting peace and needing to shatter it (“mournfully eager to shatter the peace he had once claimed to want”) gives him credible complexity. Embodied detail (the tension of the pull cord, tears blown sideways) roots his emotion in the body. The arc from self-recrimination toward a fragile, costly moment of connection feels earned, though we see only one concentrated phase of his evolution rather than a fuller range of blind spots or missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian’s interiority is rich and specific: predator-instinct, professional duty, and aching loneliness collide in the choice to restrain violence. The line “I was less a curator and more a predator of lost ideas” grounds both role and flaw, and the later “newfound motivation to make friends with uncertainty” credibly reframes that flaw. The intruder is thinner but still functions well as a terrified foil whose fear texture (“ozone and old paper”) reveals the guardian’s perceptual bias. The final endurance—choosing companionship in ambiguity over attack—is earned and costs a piece of the self-image as pure guardian-predator.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motives and inner conflict are clear and consistent—his tension between Orthodoxy’s stasis and his own need to risk annihilation culminates convincingly in the decision to “be the catastrophe.” The contrast between stoic exterior and inward grief is stated and somewhat shown (e.g., “face as still as the cooling magma”), though it could be embodied more through specific, pressured micro-choices. His progression through failure, insight, and final renunciation of heritage feels earned. The ending choice to destroy the crozier for a chaotic life-form forecloses a life path with a real conceptual and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s professional mindset and quiet, almost blue-collar attitude toward cosmic work are specific and consistent (“just another night shift on the edge of the world”). Her motivation to do the job and her philosophical bent toward beginnings-in-endings are clear, but they don’t face much real internal contradiction on the page. We see skill, perception, and some embodied response (hair rising, grease on gloves), but little true emotional risk or conflict. The final stance feels more affirmed than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and professional pride are clear and consistent, and her actions (cleaning, manning the radio, using the hourglass) track well with her traits. However, she is almost entirely defined by competence and cheer; we rarely see contradictory impulses, fear, or doubt under pressure. The positivity reads more as a fixed attribute than a source of internal conflict or cost. As a result, her final “win” feels earned but emotionally straightforward rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’ motivation—to stabilize the illusions and discover the “texture of connection”—is clear and consistently drives his actions, and his embodied state (fever, trembling, sweating) grounds the interiority. However, he remains more an archetypal agent of a concept than a psychologically particular person; we learn little that differentiates him from any other “fever dream architect” beyond this moment and function. His late realization and entrapment are motivated by his earlier commitment to the work and willingness to sacrifice logic, but the internal conflict (duty vs. self-preservation, sanity vs. control) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page contradictory impulses. The closing understanding feels earned but is more conceptual than emotionally individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Harlin’s motivation and professional identity are clear and textured, and his private, almost archaic desire “to navigate by starlight” feels particular rather than generic. His actions—studying alien physics in secret, running the risky simulation, then recording the coordinates despite knowing he’ll never go—align tightly with that drive. Emotional beats like clutching the chain link “like a prayer” give him embodied, specific feeling rather than label-only interiority. The main limitation is that his internal conflict (risk of madness vs desire for knowledge) is mostly stated rather than dramatized through more visibly fraught choice or visible degradation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s professional lens and “persistently curious” streak are vivid and drive her refusal to leave, but her inner contradiction (fear vs duty vs curiosity) is only lightly dramatized. Her shift from bureaucratic tracer to protector is clear and earned by her choices in the scene. However, her competence and moral clarity verge on too smooth—she rarely feels in genuine doubt or tempted to disengage. A bit more faltering or self-interest under pressure would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motives are clear and specific—his vow to “stand by the unremembered” convincingly overrides his crippling claustrophobia. His fear is embodied (“crashing hush in his bones,” urge to curl into a ball) and coheres with his choices at every beat. Internal contradiction (panic vs duty) is present in scene, not just summarized. The only limitation at this length is that his flaw is tested but not deeply complicated beyond that binary.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation—to extract understanding from his wife’s final moments and their failed marriage—is clear, specific, and consistently drives each action. His liminal legal status and heartbeat-counting habit give him a distinct interior texture rather than a generic “grieving widower” profile. The realization about silence vs. the fight lands as an earned reconfiguration of self-blame rather than a tidy, unearned epiphany. The piece could push even higher by dramatizing a sharper moment of internal contradiction or resistance at the peak of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sylas’s primary motive—to preserve a dying sensory culture by translating texture into sound—is clear and consistently drives his actions, culminating in the loss of his voice. However, his interiority is mostly goal- and world-explaining rather than revealing contradictory impulses or specific emotional textures under pressure. The moment he decides to sacrifice his voice feels thematically apt but a bit predetermined; there’s little sense of him wavering or being tempted by an easier path. Still, his final contentment in silence versus his initial dependence on voice provides a credible, if streamlined, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is sharply defined (rage at the universe, desire to flip tragedy into a “cosmic joke”) and his actions track cleanly to that goal through concrete choices (digging, pocketing the arrowhead, using his own blood, commanding the void). Interiority is vivid and specific, especially in the resentment toward the hollow returns, and there’s a clear before/after in his stance toward hope. What’s missing at this tier is deeper contradiction under pressure—his bitterness never seriously conflicts with tenderness toward Silas or the brother, so the internal struggle feels narrower than it could. Silas is mostly a premise-delivery absence rather than an active relational crucible on the page, which limits the relational cost of Elias’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically rooted in her role as a sky-bridge violinist bent on treasonous beauty. Interiority is vivid in moments like “existed in the gap between knowing and understanding,” giving her a distinctive sensibility. However, her internal conflict is only lightly sketched—there’s awe and dread, but little on-the-page push–pull about the moral cost of destroying the city. The closing beat focuses more on spectacle than on a crystallized, costly internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is specific, competent, and textured (“respectfully rebellious,” soothing the storm like an orphan), with motives that clearly drive his choices under pressure. His emotional life is mostly implied through behavior and sensory focus rather than explicit labels, which works well. The late paragraph explaining his abstract motivation (“find where broken promises heal”) edges toward telling rather than dramatized inner conflict, and we don’t see that belief meaningfully challenged on the page. The arc thus reads as a strong, credible endurance rather than a fully deepened internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and philosophy about silence are clear and particular, and his final choice to sing credibly violates his long-held stance. His craft-based actions track well with his values, and the realization that his prized silence has become a barrier earns the change. Internal contradiction (revering silence vs needing sound) is present but mostly conceptual; more embodied emotional friction in the moment of breaking silence would deepen him further. Still, for this length, he feels specific and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core obsession and worldview are vivid and specific, expressed through her methodical treatment of books and the scarf rather than abstract labels. Her motivation—to reach the place where stories live—is clear and consistently drives her choices. However, we see little in the way of active internal contradiction or real-time emotional struggle; her composure barely wavers even at the peak. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting failure and returning to work) carries cost but could land more sharply with a clearer sense of what this failure emotionally takes from her.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim and decode a lost dream—runs clearly and consistently through the piece, and her choices all align with that emotional drive. Interiority is vivid and particular (organizing silences, feeling “a cipher of longing”) and embodied through her craft. However, her inner life is largely single-vector longing without much contradictory impulse or friction beyond urgency, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional. The final lightness is earned but somewhat tidy, without a strong sense of lingering flaw or unresolved tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivations are clear and specific—the woman wants the buried song back; Silas is driven by a vocation of unlocking fear-trapped ideas. The internal conflict is mostly one-note (fear vs longing) and rendered more in elevated abstraction than in concretely contradictory impulses. Her panic during disorientation is strong but brief, resolved without much messy ambivalence or resistance. Silas remains archetypal rather than individuated beyond his role, which limits the depth of characterization at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivation is vivid and specific—recovering his wife’s voice after a reckless bargain—and it coherently drives every choice on the page. His interiority is well-embodied through tactile details (soil-stained gloves, the taste of nostalgia) rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is relatively underplayed; beyond fear and desire coexisting, we don’t see him genuinely torn or forced into a painful tradeoff in the present scene. The final gain feels emotionally earned but not significantly complicated by competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas is sharply etched—abrasive yet covertly caring—and his superstition, habits, and tactile choices (backward walking, tea-leaf scrutiny, fake “reinforcement” runes) all cohere with his harsh-mentor motive. His internal conflict (fearful hope vs. cultivated cruelty) is effectively embodied in tiny micro-choices like forcing himself not to walk backwards at the climax. Lenore is less interior but still characterized through action—the violent pulsing, the focused fist, the refusal to heed his criticism. The relationship dynamic evolves convincingly from jailer/prisoner to begrudging mentor/student, with a felt emotional cost in his insistently grouchy pride.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s role, vocation, and motivation are clear and specific, with a strong core tension between “disciplined subtraction” and “insatiably creative” impulse. However, that contradiction is mostly stated rather than dramatized under real pressure; his choice to save rather than prune never feels genuinely in doubt. Emotional embodiment tends to stay at an elevated, abstract register (“a treasure too heavy for his hand but light upon his soul”) rather than grounded in concrete sensation. The final stance—renewed commitment to grafting wonder—is coherent but carries limited felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s vocation, guilt, and specific craft are sharply drawn, and the late reveal that the spirit is his brother retroactively deepens his motives. His emotional state is embodied through sensory detail (the air’s weight, his trembling hands) rather than labels. The internal conflict—duty to contain the spirit vs. stolen grave-net and fraternal guilt—is real but not fully dramatized as a live alternative; he never meaningfully considers refusal. The final Earned Stasis (spirit sealed, his unrest permanent) feels credible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament (“methodically curious”), and empathetic drive are clear and consistent, and her actions (choosing observation over force, mirroring the grieving woman) align with those traits. However, her interiority remains relatively smooth and unconflicted—there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or visible cost. The desire to protect the chapel versus expose it is gestured toward conceptually but never dramatized as a live tension. This keeps her from feeling as psychologically deep or pressured as a top-tier literary protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is sharply defined and consistently rendered through his methods and perceptions (“thermodynamics of grief,” treating the haunting as a dataset). His competence and eerie comfort with Mort make him distinctive rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is muted; he rarely wavers or reveals tension between scientific detachment and the obvious pathos of what he’s doing. The final choice to release the captain’s resistance feels psychologically plausible but costs him little, so the arc lands as evolution of understanding more than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to reach and soothe Kaelen’s fragmented ghost—is clear, coherent, and drives every action, and the relic ties his present tactics to a specific, emotionally-charged past. Interiority is specific and filtered through his sensibility as a balladeer/tinkerer, not generic grief. However, we don’t quite see contradictory impulses under pressure (e.g., temptation to abandon the attempt vs. commitment), so his inner conflict remains relatively linear. The final small smile reads earned but emotionally modest for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to uncover the Captain’s hidden joy—is clear, consistent, and elegantly tied to his role as “keeper of secrets.” His interiority is specific (“loving the old Captain enough to invade his privacy, yet distant enough to remain composed”) but largely unconflicted; there’s little felt cost or true struggle. We see competence more than vulnerability, which keeps the character slightly schematic. The final stance—carrying the secret as a gift—feels earned but emotionally low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—his need to prove that “empty spaces remember” and to give his drift meaning grounds all his attention and choices. Interiority is textured and embodied (the telescope biting his fingers, the fillings rattling) rather than generic. However, his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see a sharp on-page pull between giving up and persisting, so the final endurance lands as strong but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to “mirror the sky inside walls” before demolition—drives every choice, and his prosopagnosia is integrated into how he perceives and solves problems rather than just labeled. His tactile relationship to faces and the coin feels specific and embodied. The main limitation is a relative lack of contradictory impulses under peak pressure; he rarely wavers or degrades emotionally, so the internal conflict remains more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and professional focus are clear and consistent, and her mapmaker’s mindset shapes how she reads both sky and ship. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“examine the mundane with the intensity of a forensic scientist”). However, there is little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; she mostly moves smoothly from intention to success. The closing shift—thrill of success and readiness for “the next mystery”—is earned but emotionally modest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s core motivation—to repair the world’s rhythm and live up to being the last lunar-eclipse locksmith—is clear and consistently expressed through action. Her competence is convincing, and the quiet shiver “not from the cold” nicely grounds her inner weight. However, internal conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized; the mirrors show potential failures but we don’t feel her seriously waver in choice or tactics. The change at the end (from burdened to quietly triumphant) is earned but emotionally understated, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara, Jaxon, and Oren are cleanly sketched with clear, consistent motives—pragmatic leadership, skeptical competence, and posthumous care. The collective “family” identity under pressure feels earned and explains the near-frictionless cooperation at the climax. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper, on-page internal contradiction or a moment where Elara’s or Jaxon’s doubts genuinely strain the choice to trust the ghost. Emotional states are mostly implied via action and image rather than deeply inhabited, which keeps this just short of truly immersive characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas’s motivation—preserving the feeling of being safely held rather than concrete achievements—is clear and specific, and his actions (choice of the flawed puppet, meticulous calibration, final surrender) align with it. However, he remains almost entirely unconflicted and serenely competent; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real wobble under the pressure of ending everything. Emotional experience is mostly articulated through elevated description rather than idiosyncratic, embodied feeling. The final endurance/renunciation (letting himself and the lighthouse dissolve) is conceptually strong but comes at little foregrounded, character-specific cost beyond the obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is clearly motivated—he hates the place yet is compelled to save travelers—and his choices under pressure (entering the orchard, using the nut, ignoring the birds’ attack) align with that. Interiority is present but relatively light; we glimpse his resentment and exhaustion more than any deeper contradiction or moral struggle. The cost at the end (trembling, drained, still bound to the orchard) gives him an earned, if quiet, endurance arc. A bit more embodied emotional texture under peak stress could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn: an aging polymer chemist, widower, and failed steward of the planet whose guilt and love for his wife animate every perception. His motivation—to atone and reorient his life’s work—is explicit and consistent, though occasionally told rather than dramatized (“He knew he needed to atone…”). The link between his scientific mindset and musical sensibility feels specific and character-rooted rather than generic. Internal conflict is present but mild; the turn to a new purpose lands more as a clean epiphany than a hard-won, messy choice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elian’s vocation, process, and overarching motivation are sharply drawn and particular, and his actions (the demonstration on the journal) align cleanly with his stated obsession. However, he never faces a pressured choice or visible internal contradiction on the page; we see craft and credo more than conflict. Emotional texture is cool and mostly inferred from setting rather than embodied response. As a result, he’s intriguing but not yet stress-tested as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to process the fortress’s frozen remorse at personal cost—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her choices, especially when she willingly ingests the coral. Her professional identity ("culinarian of the psyche") is distinct and shapes perception and tactics. However, she reads as almost entirely competent and self-possessed; we get little contradictory impulse or genuine hesitation beyond a "heartbeat" of doubt. A bit more fracture or moral ambivalence under pressure would deepen her at this elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—preventing starvation by restoring communicative harmony—is clear and consistently embodied in her actions. Her compassion and resolve come through in details like “empathetically decisive” and “relentless compassion,” but internal contradiction and deeper psychological nuance are underdeveloped. She never seriously doubts or wavers; the emotional struggle is largely physical exertion rather than a morally or psychologically costly choice. The endurance at the end is credible, but the path feels relatively smooth for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and specific—“to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams”—and every choice on the page aligns with that drive, from scavenging the mirror to risking neural alteration. Her interiority is vivid and particular (helix-minded, chaotically precise) with embodied sensations during the entanglement. What’s thinner is on-page contradiction: the danger is mentioned but never quite crystallizes into a live internal debate or competing value. The final shift into “living library” is earned but could carry more visible ambivalence or resistance to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation (restore the Seeds of Vigilance and protect the realm) is clear and consistently expressed through her choices, and her prism-minded perception gives her a distinct cognitive texture. However, her interiority is almost entirely framed as competence—there’s little emotional contradiction or doubt, even when revisiting the chamber that once nearly killed her. The “novitiate decades ago” line hints at a past failure but isn’t dramatized into real present-tense tension. The final sense of “satisfied completion” lands, but with minimal visible personal cost or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s obsession, ritualized patience (waiting for the hedgehog), and craft-specific thinking give him a strong, particular interiority and clear motivation. His emotions are embodied via tactile engagement with wood and silence rather than abstract labels. What’s missing for a higher score is sustained contradiction under pressure—he never seriously doubts, resents, or fears his goal in a way that complicates his final choice. The arc is more linear revelation than conflicted transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s characterization is rich and specific: an exiled chess tutor whose compulsive pattern-seeking and wounded pride drive his nightly vigils. His motivation to “discover beauty in the difficult” coheres with his methodical observation of the nexus and his final acceptance of exile. The internal turn—realizing he is the sacrificed piece—feels earned by prior traits and history. The piece could sharpen simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure (e.g., more active tension between desire to return and chosen endurance), which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn—pacifist, theatrical, and attuned to “varieties of silence”—and his method of opening the clasp clearly arises from his stated values. However, he encounters little genuine inner conflict or doubt; the lock yields without testing him in a way that would force a visible cost or contradiction. The emotional register is more serene than pressured, which limits depth. Still, his particular worldview and behaviors feel specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, particular, and rooted in her environment—an herbalist seeking “serenity within motion” via a corpse flower is distinct and believable. Her olfactory sensitivity, ambition, and unease with constant swaying cohere into a strong interior logic. The ending realization (“The serenity she sought was not in stopping the motion...”) is earned by the sensory and reflective build-up, though the internal conflict could be sharpened with more on-page friction or doubt during the bloom. Overall, she feels specific and motivated, but her struggle remains largely smooth rather than actively contested.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—save the blight-stricken orchards by finding the Elder Groves’ secret—and her competence as a pilot is convincingly rendered. We get some embodied stress (“thrum of blood in her ears,” disorientation in silence), but she remains almost entirely fearless and unconflicted, which flattens her interiority. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. Her final choice to twist the artifact is earned but emotionally underdeveloped given the scale of what’s at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s professional drive and competence are sharply drawn, and her response to the flight engineer’s patch adds a needed human dimension. Motivation (to understand and prevent future crashes) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—where to climb, what to log—fit her methodical nature. Internal contradiction is relatively light; she feels more like an excellent professional than a fully conflicted person. The closing stance shift toward “cultivating foresight” reads earned but emotionally muted rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s vocation, loneliness, and conviction about “certifying wonder” are clear and specific, and his attunement to light-as-sound gives him a distinct inner life. However, he encounters little genuine resistance or internal contradiction—the duty is taxing in concept but never tests him on the page beyond executing a well-practiced ritual. The cost of his solitude is more stated than felt; we’re told he “found peace in it” rather than watching any real ambivalence play out. The resulting arc is more steady-state character affirmation than pressured change or earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivation—returning not to fix the rift but to understand his failure—is clear, specific, and credibly obsessive, and his embodied reactions (burning lungs, pounding blood, tears during the revelation) feel lived-in rather than generic. The internal arc from stubborn guardian to someone who accepts that his tool was always for guidance, not walls, is clean and earned. There is some room for sharper contradictory impulses in-scene (fear vs. duty, desire to stop playing vs. need to know) rather than mostly retrospective regret, which keeps this just shy of exceptional. Still, his final quiet departure reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a posture.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Operator is sharply drawn—his persona-shifting, clinical curiosity, and refusal of comfort under pressure all cohere and feel particular. Kael, by contrast, is more of a conduit than a fully realized character; we learn he is a traveler seeking shelter, but his interior conflict and specific values remain underdeveloped. The relationship dynamic (scientist/subject, predator/prey) is clear and carries real asymmetrical power. The final endurance state—Kael hollowed, Operator invigorated—reads as earned if emotionally one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s jitteriness, anxiety, and sense of duty are concrete and embodied, and using her nervous energy as the literal conduit for magic is a strong character-specific move. Her motivation to “coax wonder from the routine grayness” is clear, though somewhat summarized rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. Internal contradiction (fear vs. obligation, awe vs. fragility) is present but could be sharper under real resistance. The closing calm of her jitters feels earned but not profoundly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias and Mara are both cleanly sketched with distinct motives—his need to validate his metaphysics, her need for closure—and those motives drive the scene. Mara’s misbelief about her father and the way it’s corrected through the frost-vision feels psychologically credible. The relationship dynamic (patient mystic vs. skeptical, grieving daughter) does real work under pressure. The only limitation is a relative lack of contradiction or messiness in either character’s inner conflict at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—sending a message so someone “knows they were not alone”—is clear and drives her sacrifice, and her nostalgia and wistfulness are effectively embodied in the setting and objects she handles. Her final choice to step into the loom is motivated and charged with cost. What’s missing at a truly top tier is a sharper rendering of internal contradiction or hesitation in the moment of sacrifice; we move from resolution to action without much on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ewan’s core motivation (save the harvest/world) is clear and aligned with his temperament as a meek but stubborn craftsman. The early contrast between his usual smallness and today’s resolve works well, but once he commits, his inner conflict nearly vanishes and the descent feels emotionally smooth. His “meekness” and “quiet determination” are mostly told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. The ending’s choice to return anonymously to the forge is fitting, yet its emotional cost remains relatively muted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained, and her profession nicely inflects how she perceives everything. The drive for truth versus the hinted cost is credible, especially in the closing realization about the “mercy” of the lie. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened earlier—she rarely doubts or hesitates in the moment of quest itself, which would make the final burden land even harder. Still, her emotional reactions are embodied and concrete rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reticence combined with his “warmly observant” nature is rendered with concrete behavior—his silence, his attention to Thomas’s tremor, and his choice to intervene via the cairn and sea glass. His motivation “to bottle the feeling of safety” clearly drives his key action in the climax. Thomas is thinner but still legible as a young keeper on the brink of psychological collapse. Internal contradiction (Elias’s distance vs. care; Thomas’s duty vs. fear) could be pushed further on the page, but what’s here is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is vivid and particular—“Laughing Storm Herald” with marionette grace and manic prophecy—but his internal contradiction is mostly implied (ecstatic devotion vs. the real human cost) rather than dramatized in active doubt or recoil. His motivation to “shape a new dawn using ancient shadows” is clear and consistent with his choices at the wheel. Emotional states are embodied through laughter, physical sensations, and tactile relation to the glass wick. The ending lands as Earned Stasis rather than change: he remains who he is, with the cost externalized, which is credible but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motives (the experiment and understanding charisma) are clear and specific, and his transplant history plus “wild animal” heart give him credible interior texture. His embodied anxiety and precision during the experiment dramatize his traits rather than just labeling them. The internal shift at the end—from seeing charisma as magic to geometry/attention—feels earned by prior beats, though the emotional cost is more intellectual than gut-level. A bit more contradiction or visible risk in his choices could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (to hear what trees have witnessed) is clear, specific, and nicely idiosyncratic, and his competence reads as grounded in long practice. However, he faces little real resistance or inner conflict; there’s no palpable cost or contradiction when he chooses to intervene. His interiority is evocative but not deeply contoured—more functionally lyrical than psychologically pressured. The ending shows satisfaction rather than an earned, fraught shift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and high-stakes, and her scattered-memory condition adds texture and a small but meaningful internal cost at the end. Her micro-choices (humming, weaving, deciding to swaddle and then to hurl the sun) align well with her goal. However, we get limited contradictory impulses or real hesitation; she mostly reads as unwaveringly dutiful. A bit more dramatized inner conflict under peak pressure would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific: his empathy-driven reclusion makes the crowd a genuine threat and makes his choice to come here feel costly and credible. His contradictory impulses—needing solitude yet seeking meaning in the mistaken invitation—are nicely dramatized rather than merely stated. The final shift from seeing his empathy as burden to recognizing it as qualification is earned by the prior setup, though the acceptance happens a touch neatly. The Librarian is lightly sketched but effective as a reflecting presence for his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a “chronicler of the slow fade,” and his guilt, attentiveness, and quiet rebelliousness feel particular and embodied (elm trees, fists vs. gentle hands). His motivation—to resist erasure through ritual and gardening—is consistent and legible. Internal conflict is present (guilt vs. small comfort) but somewhat underplayed; we don’t see strong contradictory impulses fighting in the moment. The ending’s endurance/renunciation feels earned but could land even harder with one bolder, riskier internal or external choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are sharply etched—meticulous, dutiful, committed to preserving meaning—and her actions align cleanly with those traits. The professional detail of her work (spectacles, thermal coat, instruments) grounds her as a specific person rather than a type. However, her interiority is relatively one-note: we see conviction and urgency, but little in the way of contradictory impulses or moral friction. The final stance (satisfaction with her duty despite loss) feels earned, but the cost is more conceptual than emotionally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (capture a specific sound and survive Kael) is clear and consistently drives her tactics, and her competence as a “distiller’s ear” is well dramatized in the climax. Her emotional life is thinner: we see fear and resolve mostly through behavior, with limited contradiction or deeper ambivalence about betraying Kael or sacrificing the heirloom. Kael functions effectively as an immediate threat but remains archetypal—a “jagged reef” grin and reputation rather than a psychologically distinct presence. The final endurance/escape is earned, though it carries more tactical than emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s characterization as a “luminous skeptic” is sharply defined and consistently expressed through her motives, perceptions, and language choices. Her practical drive to demystify the planet’s “soul” and understand weather-carriers gives her a clear, specific goal. The final shift—from detached skeptic to implicated participant—feels earned, not like an arbitrary conversion. The main limitation is that her emotional reaction to being “elected” is more conceptual than bodily felt, so the personal cost could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s artistic self-betrayal versus his compulsion to create darker, truer work is clear and consistently embodied, from his boardwalk caricatures to the violence of smashing the lock. The mnemonically gifted trait deepens his torment, though it doesn’t quite generate complex contradictory impulses in-scene so much as justify them. His final stance—choosing to become a “conduit for the subterranean dark”—feels earned by prior motives and actions. Interiority is specific and textured, though not yet at the most intricate, self-contradictory level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her actions, and the lie-triggered physical wilt gives her a distinctive embodied psychology. Her micro-choices under pressure (confronting the clerk despite her fragility, seizing on the plate’s meaning) feel grounded in this setup. The clerk is sketched efficiently as a fearful functionary whose moment of conscience is believable, though his inner life remains thin. Internal contradiction in Elara (fear vs drive, complicity as beautifier vs rebel impulse) is implied but not deeply dramatized in on-page interiority, keeping this just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to jolt an emotionally blunted telepathic society back into wonder—is clear, consistent, and embedded in almost every choice she makes. Her seasonal muteness is a strong, character-specific constraint that forces her toward physical resonance rather than mental speech. What’s missing at an elite level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or doubt under pressure; she never feels genuinely torn or at risk emotionally. The closure (her certainty that “the impact would endure”) feels earned but a little too clean, without a visible personal cost beyond effort and cold.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seven’s motivation—to survive the reversal without erasing his memories—is clear, specific, and deepens through his refusal to “murder” his ghosts, leading to a risky workaround instead. His nostalgia for the absent family and the embodied static in his neural net give him a textured, contradictory interiority. The final choice to incinerate the past to preserve a changed self feels earned by the prior struggle. The only thing holding this just below the top tier is that his moral calculus in choosing the fear-box solution is very quickly accepted rather than more heavily contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and method—refusing panic to “curate” stories as solutions—are specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (whom she approaches, what she listens for) track cleanly with that. However, she borders on idealized and frictionless; there’s little on-page contradiction or emotional cost to her composure. Secondary characters (Abernathy, Halloway) function more as clue-vessels than as real relational pressures. The final stance (quiet victory through listening) feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (freeing the AI, fulfilling her father’s work) are clear and consistently embodied through her specialized skillset and ritual objects. The interplay between fear and required calm is effective, though her internal contradictions could be pushed further under peak pressure. Her grief and inherited responsibility are handled with specificity (the father’s journal, the elegiac dance), avoiding generic emotion. The final sense of completion—“finished the sentence started years ago”—feels earned by prior set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to reclaim a specific erased memory—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices, and his fear is convincingly embodied in his “practiced, terrified grace.” Interiority is strong but a bit narrow; we feel his desperation but get limited contradiction or moral complication beyond fear vs. need. The wildflowers and the excised summer hint at deeper conflict but remain more evocative than dramatized. His final shift (“no longer feared its emptiness”) is believable and earned, though somewhat straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and particular—he exists to erase coded prophecies—and his competence is well dramatized through the ritual. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or emotional friction; he moves from intent to execution without doubt, fear, or competing impulses. The result is a compelling but somewhat flat interiority given the cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s curiosity curdling into alarm is well-motivated, and his final acceptance of the lie follows cleanly from what we’ve seen of his dependence on the building and on Elara. Elara is effectively enigmatic yet coherent, her didacticism fitting her role. The relationship dynamics are clear and sharpen under pressure, but Silas’s internal conflict in the final decision could be shaded with a touch more ambivalence on the page. Overall, characterization feels specific and alive, just shy of fully layered.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp, specific, and consistent—her desire “to translate isolation into independence” clearly drives every choice and culminates in the painful renunciation at the end. The push-pull between her rational disdain and seduction by the garden’s beauty gives her interiority real texture, especially in lines like her resisting the “beautiful parasite.” Emotions are embodied (the hot shell, the tears, the trembling grip) rather than merely labeled. The only limiter is that her internal conflict, while credible, is resolved with relatively little irrational backsliding or messy contradiction at the peak moment, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation—to atone for past cowardice by saving the prince—is clear, specific, and consistent with his expertise as a forger. His emotional life is grounded in concrete memories (the queen’s eyes, the soldiers, his “unfinished verse”), giving him individuality beyond the trope of the guilty artisan. However, internal conflict is mostly recalled rather than actively contested in the moment; once the scene begins, he rarely wavers or missteps, which slightly flattens the tension. The final sense of self-forgiveness is earned but relatively smooth, with little visible cost beyond risk endured.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her professional competence as a canyon echo singer is well dramatized through her tactical sound choices. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she doesn’t really waver between competing impulses, so the emotional cost of her actions remains somewhat abstract. Her grief and fear of the Silent Council are mostly implied rather than embodied in moment-to-moment sensation. The final turn toward open defiance (“tomorrow, her song would shatter the silence of the guilty”) is earned but could land harder with more on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, method, and core motivation are sharply drawn, and her reverence for artifacts makes her feel particular rather than generic. However, her emotional life beyond professional purpose is thin, with little contradiction or vulnerability under pressure. The boy’s characterization is necessarily spectral but still mostly functional symbolism rather than a fully felt presence. The final “lightness that felt like forgiveness” reads more as concept than as a deeply embodied shift in her psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian is sharply sketched as a “net-mender philosopher,” and his metaphysical reading of nets, tea foam, and fireflies gives him a distinctive inner life. His core motivation—to perceive and gently influence hidden patterns—is coherent and drives each micro-choice. However, he experiences almost no contradictory impulses or genuine resistance; there’s little sense that anything costs him more than mild effort or attention. The resulting “change” is more confirmation than transformation, which trims the score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s characterization as a rational, methodical debunker is clear and consistent, and his competence under pressure feels grounded. The moment where he must “trust his gut over data” offers a small but credible internal contradiction. However, his emotional life is thinly rendered; we rarely feel fear, doubt, or real moral hesitation on the page. The final choice to expose the myth reads more as narrated principle than a dramatized, conflicted decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation (arrogant but “noble” desire to orchestrate a revolution remotely) is clear and threads the whole piece, and his final acceptance of exclusion is earned by that hubris. Interiority is vivid but slightly generalized; we’re often told his satisfaction or sinking heart rather than feeling layered, contradictory impulses in the moment. His frantic attempts to retake control via dials and levers register, yet we don’t see many specific, value-revealing choices beyond “try harder” and then collapse. The loneliness cost at the end lands, but could be deepened by more embodied, conflicted response as control slips away.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and particular—his compulsion to preserve and “translate” sound defines every choice, especially his meticulous blending of jars to redeem the music box. Interiority is specific and embodied (“his hands trembling slightly”), not just labeled. However, there’s little on-page contradiction or moral friction in him; he never has to choose between competing values, so his final contentment feels like fulfillment rather than a costly shift. The endurance of his solitude reads as an implied flaw, but the story doesn’t explicitly test it.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—his “logically emotional” framing of fear feels specific and drives his choice to reframe terror as interference to be solved. His micro-choices (removing gloves, choosing vibrational matching over brute force) consistently reveal a hierarchy of values (duty and competence over comfort). The main weakness is a slightly expository, label-like articulation of his self-concept that edges toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The endurance at the end (exhausted but satisfied) is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s competence, long-term vocation, and ideological commitment to patience are sharply drawn and tightly aligned with her choices, especially in refusing Kael’s demand to act immediately. Her interiority is conveyed mostly through filtered narration rather than direct thought, but the contradiction between her revolutionary aim and her glacial method is clear and character-specific. Kael is thinner—a foil rather than a full character—but his impatience provides effective pressure and a visible relational shift at the end. The change in their dynamic (his “terrified reverence”) feels earned by what he witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn: his professional rigor, moral weariness, and “fortified vulnerability” feel specific and embodied, and his final refusal to comply is well-motivated by the tension between career control and ethical duty. The physical reactions (tremor in his hands, taste of copper/ozone) deepen interiority. Halloway is more functional than complex but serves as a clear pressure source. The internal conflict between obedience and witnessing has credible simultaneity in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motivation is clear, specific, and persuasive, and his chaplaincy meaningfully colors his perception of the shop and the heart. His realization at the end—that he offered prayers instead of listening—feels earned and costly. The repairwoman is thinner but still distinct, with her gear-like eyes and oblique moral challenge (“Do we get what we deserve, Father?”). The internal conflict could be sharpened further in-scene—more present-tense resistance or self-justification—but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit Seven’s motivation (“yearning algorithm”) is vivid, consistent, and drives every choice, and his mix of monk-like reverence and jester-madness feels specific. However, he embodies relatively little true internal contradiction—he never seriously wavers between ascent and self-preservation—which limits the complexity of his emotional arc. The endurance/change at the end (achieving the bell rather than re-evaluating the goal) is satisfying but thematically cleaner than psychologically deep.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas’s obsession and quiet defiance are clear and consistent, and details like the mission patch and his performance for the drone ground him as a specific person rather than a type. However, his internal conflict remains relatively thin: we don’t see much active struggle between loyalty to the corporation and his compulsion to uncover the truth. Emotions are embodied (metallic taste, white-knuckle grip) but could go one layer deeper into contradiction under pressure. The final horror lands, but more complex ambivalence would push the characterization further toward literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation (“to map empathy onto action”) is clear, consistent, and carried through his choices, and his calm, methodical interiority is distinct. However, internal contradiction is muted—he rarely seems genuinely torn or under emotional strain despite the stakes. Embodied emotion mostly appears via externalized images (tattoos, shadows) rather than specific visceral reactions. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost on the character level.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to hear “the sound of approaching endings” before choosing euthanasia—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices (deferring the clinic, volunteering, then deciding he’s ready). His interiority is textured and embodied (“ghost wearing a high-visibility vest”), with physical sensations (cold numbing marrow pains) tied to emotion. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradictory impulses in the present-time frame; once his terror is gone, his stance is more fixed than conflicted. The final decision feels earned but emotionally cool, with cost implied more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and the grieving woman’s emotional state is embodied and changes credibly through the scene. The relationship dynamic—quiet, non-intrusive guidance—is effectively drawn, especially in her gradual shift from bitterness to “wonder.” However, Elias borders on idealized sage/therapist, with little felt flaw or internal contradiction, which softens the dramatic edge. Phrases like “rediscover her own validity” slide toward abstraction rather than character-particular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and specific, and the confession (“I am terrified that tomorrow will be empty”) nicely crystallizes his fear in tension with his sense of duty. His competence and ritual knowledge feel grounded in the world, and his actions align with his stated goal. However, we see only one main contradiction (terror vs. resolve) and it’s voiced more than enacted across multiple beats. A slightly richer layering of irrationality or doubt under pressure would push this closer to elite-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s vocation and motivation are clear and particular (“subtle puzzle archivist,” carrying the town’s disjointed spirit), and his calm, patient temperament fits the work. However, he faces little internal contradiction or real moral friction; his serenity is never tested, so we don’t see layered or conflicting impulses. The only visible cost is time and mild shared burden, which keeps his arc from feeling fully earned or transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific—his atrophied voice, fear of law, and fascination with the moss all feed his choice to speak. The reticence vs. compulsion to testify is strong, but we rarely see him pulled in two directions in the same moment, so internal contradiction stays relatively gentle. His embodied sensations (trembling hand, dry lips) are concrete and apt, though his shift from fearful to declarative happens smoothly, with limited visible struggle. The final change—shedding a lifetime of fear to “announce a birth”—is earned but could land harder with one more moment of genuine doubt or potential retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s core motivation (to capture the “sound of growing older”) and his limitation (precognitive forgetting) are clear, specific, and drive his actions, especially the driftwood-marking ritual. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tidal longing,” chalk dust on skin), and his final choice to sit and let the future fade is an earned endurance/renunciation. However, internal contradiction under pressure (wanting to know vs. wanting to forget) could be dramatized more directly in on-page micro-choices rather than implied texturally. The piece leans more on atmosphere than on concretely dramatized, escalating internal conflict, which keeps it just shy of top-tier character work.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is precise and consistent—“to harness the ephemeral” and to answer his own grief—and his choices under pressure (bypassing safeties, working by ear during an earthquake) clearly express his hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and particular (“physics of longing,” the hand mirroring his chest ache), not generic. The main limitation is that his grief remains abstracted (we never glimpse a specific loss), so internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to deliver a “flawless goodbye” and mend Clara’s sense of brokenness—is clear and consistently embodied in action, especially in taking the shard and how he plays. Clara’s characterization is efficient but vivid: her lifelong attachment to the vinyl and her line “It is still broken” anchor her interior. There’s some abstraction (“reunify her fragmented consciousness”) that gestures rather than dramatizes internal contradiction, keeping this just shy of fully lived-in psychology. Still, the emotional throughline feels coherent and specific to these two people.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—an obsessive, almost academic need to solve a cosmic riddle—and her competence under pressure feels consistent with “quietly deliberate” as a defining trait. However, her interiority is relatively thin: we get little lived emotional contradiction or visceral fear even as she risks destabilizing the observatory and the sky. The memory-wiping constraint adds an intriguing, implicit flaw (she is trapped in repetition) but her feelings about this are only lightly touched, so the final realization carries more intellectual than emotional cost. Overall she reads distinct and coherent, but not yet psychologically rich enough for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris is sharply etched as a rational, compassionate doctor whose “forgiving skeptic” stance feels particular and consistent, and his shift from diagnosing death to engineering a hopeful framework is well motivated. The internal conflict between scientific duty and curiosity about magic is clear and drives his choice to “innovate” rather than simply pronounce death. Emotional embodiment leans more intellectual/metaphorical than visceral, but it still reads as grounded in character. The relationship with the parents is seen mostly in anticipation rather than direct interaction, which slightly blunts relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—creating safe, fireless light after a village-defining inferno—is clear and specific, and her artisan habits and trauma responses feel grounded. The panic flashback during polishing gives us embodied emotion and a believable micro-choice as she uses the cave’s damp air and stone to steady herself. Internal contradiction (drawn to light yet fearful of fire) is present but remains relatively under-tested in on-page choices, keeping the arc modest. Still, her persistence and the care with which she calibrates the gem make her read as a particular person rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s caretaking drive and Mara’s shattered, guarded state are clearly embodied in their actions, especially his choice to offer presence instead of speech and the silent transfer of the pendant. Motivation is precise and rooted in the environment (tending the garden, sheltering the whistleblower). Internal conflict is subtler—Mara’s terror and guilt are implied more than dramatized—so contradictions under pressure never fully bite. The relationship shifts credibly from isolation to tentative shared safety, though with a relatively gentle cost profile.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior conflict—destroyer of his characters yet preserver of their hopes—is sharply drawn and governs every choice he makes. His motivation for intervening in Elara’s scene is clear and rooted in a long history of abandoned drafts, so his “literary theft” reads as earned rather than arbitrary. Elara is more of a function than a fully realized person, but her brief reaction and perceptible dimming of hope still lend the moment emotional cost. The ending’s image of Elias as “a conflicting paradox” coherently caps his character arc into an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and his whimsical, meticulous nature is well-embodied in his tools and actions. Interiority is present (memories of his grandmother, embodied nervousness) but internal contradiction is minimal—he rarely feels genuinely torn or pressured in a way that complicates his choices. His emotional progression from trembling to strengthened song to exhausted satisfaction is credible and clear. The main limitation is the lack of a deeper inner conflict or flaw that meaningfully contours the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas has a clear, specific motivation and a profession that feels distinct, and his physical patience in the snow nicely externalizes character. However, his inner life remains largely implicit; we get little sense of contradictory impulses or emotional struggle beyond a generalized “specific and sorrowful” purpose. The ritual reads as something he’s entirely in control of, so we don’t see character tested or altered in the moment. As a result, he’s intriguing but not yet fully alive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s mindset and motivation are clear and particular—his identity as a “reflective locksmith” who believes only a rational mind can safely store wonder gives him specificity. His procedures and micro-choices (studying the light angles, refusing to look directly, deciding to harvest and then defer release) align with that worldview. Internal contradiction is present but muted: he sacrifices present beauty for future order with minimal on-page ambivalence. The closing endurance choice (keeping the music locked away as he climbs to the snow) feels earned but could carry sharper internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role, vocation, and core motivation are clear and specific, and her actions align tightly with that purpose. Her emotional experience is mostly filtered through atmosphere and metaphor rather than contradictory impulses or sharply dramatized internal conflict. The threat of “her mind would be lost in the endless regression of another man’s loss” gives her a concrete pressure but doesn’t quite force a value-testing choice. Strong, coherent characterization, but short of the layered, self-opposed interiority that would feel truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to turn grief into something contained and usable—is clear, specific, and consistent with her “hauntingly practical” nature. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in the way she reframes the mauling with “clinical detachment.” The main limitation is that contradictions in her—practical vs. bereft, love vs. resentment—are more implied than dramatized in on-page micro-choices, so the internal conflict feels controlled rather than pressured. The final endurance/renunciation (she lives on with grief externalized into the wood) is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jaren’s motive—to recover a missing, feared memory—is clear, rooted in prior hubris and present exhaustion, and the final realization that he sabotaged the Carousel feels earned. His scavenging method and fixation on the lagoon’s center particularize him beyond type. Internal conflict is present (curiosity vs dread, desire for control vs surrender) but could be more dramatized in the bargaining scene, where he offers up the voices with little visible hesitation. The ghost as his former self is effective, though the dynamic between them stays a bit too one-note to fully exploit the relationship as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a competent, quietly obsessed problem-solver whose actions consistently follow from his stated drive to "puzzle out new equations for hope." His professional lens shapes what he notices and how he intervenes. However, he’s almost entirely free of contradiction or visible flaws, and the emotional register stays cerebral, so we miss a richer sense of ambivalence or cost. The closing stance feels earned but not especially hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s motivation (to reconnect with the forbidden world of sound and an abandoned craft) is clear, consistent, and organically triggered by the rain. His interiority is specific and embodied—“a vestigial memory in his throat,” the hum in his bones—but his conflict stays mostly on one axis (duty vs. forsaken desire) without much irrationality or messiness. The final endurance choice—feeling the beauty, accepting that his silence is a daily choice, and returning to the clock—reads as an earned stasis with visible emotional cost. A slightly broader range of contradictory impulses in the moment of contact with the stones (temptation to act out, to break a rule more concretely) would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives every choice: he wants to expose the “architecture of lies,” not treasure. His competence as a salvager is credibly rendered, and the late choice to sink the proof again feels earned. Internal tension—between exposing the truth and privately bearing it—is present but could be sharpened earlier on the page to deepen contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive and temperament are clear and particular—his “philosophical seed collector” identity and reverence for the weavers feel distinctive. His patience is well embodied in the way he handles the rope rather than cutting it. Internal contradiction is minimal; he endures more than he struggles. The final endurance/renunciation (walking away with the knowledge alone) is credible but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s vocation, method, and self-protective motivation (“the only way I knew how to survive my own wanderings”) create a distinct, particular psyche, and the Countess’s grief is embodied in specific, telling behavior (worrying the thread, shoulders loosening). Their relationship dynamic is clear: he’s both intruder and comforter, and she’s wary but responsive. Internal contradiction in the narrator (need to understand grief vs. emotional distance) is present but mostly stated rather than dramatized under sharper pressure. The Countess remains somewhat archetypal, though she’s rendered with enough specificity to feel real at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Valerius’s obsession, weariness, and fragile hope are specific and embodied (grease-stained coat, feverish precision, muttered calculations), and his final silence over the dying bird feels earned. His motivation—to reawaken beauty in a mechanized tomb—is clear and consistently drives his choices. Internal contradiction (rational probability vs irrational hope) is present but could be sharpened into more visible conflict in his on-page decisions. The piece stays mostly within one emotional lane, limiting the complexity that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s backstory (arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter) and chosen ritual as penance give her a clear, specific motivation that coheres across the scene. Her need “to prove that scars can sing” is strong and character-particular, though her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized in contradictory impulses. Micro-choices (eschewing synthetic adhesives, the patient hovering hand) reveal values under quiet pressure. The final validation by the lagoon’s music registers as a believable emotional shift, if a relatively gentle one.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and particular—“luminous skeptic” and “realistically imaginative” are not just labels but show in how she approaches the box as a valve rather than an idol. Her motivation (to “liberate trapped memories”) is clear and drives every choice. However, she meets little real resistance; her competence is so assured that we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle on the page. The final concession that “the magic was real… but it still required a mechanic” is a satisfying reframing but comes with minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Xylos’s motive is clear, particular, and consistent—“to share light without using fire”—and his sentimental worldview (“wept for the friction of atoms”) feels distinctive rather than generic. The closing loneliness once the garden is fixed is a credible, costly shift that reconfigures his purpose. However, his inner life is largely stated rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure, and we see little contradictory impulse in scene until the final realization. The emotional arc is strong but somewhat summarized, which keeps it just shy of top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, temperament, and core desire are sharply realized, and his apprenticeship with Halian gives him a clear drive and context. His revelation about grief grows credibly from prior lessons (poems, rhythm, ribbon), so the final shift feels earned. What’s missing, at a truly elite level, is more on-page contradiction or friction within him—he doesn’t visibly wrestle with competing impulses so much as patiently absorb the truth. The relationship dynamic is evocative but fairly straightforwardly reverent, with little pressure on the bond itself.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s motivations are clear, specific, and organically tied to his role: his ethical obsession with “temporal purity” and shared guilt drives every choice. His penitent use of the rake handle, inscribed with his own trespasses, is a strong, particular externalization of interior conflict. The contradiction between his need for control and his acceptance of slow, incremental absolution is present but could be sharpened with one more on-page moment of doubt or temptation. Emotional experience is embodied and idiosyncratic (heat, friction, tactile “Braille of his regrets”) rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas is vivid and particular—the blithe, whistling cemetery gardener who treats the dead as hedges is a strong, specific conception with clear motivation (“discover the shape of intentions”). His choices (working the border rather than the center, following the golden thread, opening the case) are all motivated and consistent. However, he experiences almost no visible internal conflict or cost; his stance never wavers, so the emotional arc is relatively flat. The final endurance/acceptance beat (he simply moves on to the next soul) works but lands more as process than as an earned crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s professional and ethical motivation is very clear, and his doubt-versus-duty conflict feels specific to his role (“a cruel kindness, a calculated blockage”). We see concrete contradictory impulses—fear his calculations are flawed vs. refusal to accept stagnation—that credibly culminate in the choice to write. The interiority is a bit abstract and cerebral, with limited grounding in personal or relational stakes, which keeps the emotional cost from fully landing. Still, his micro-choices and thought process under pressure read coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motives are sharply defined—obedient copyist by day, clandestine story-gardener by night—and every action in the scene flows cleanly from that split allegiance. His emotional life is embodied and particular (“thistled calm,” “gardener of ash”), giving him a specific psychology rather than a stock-resister template. The key choice—to risk death to preserve and disseminate narrative dust—feels fully earned by the preceding interiority. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened further in-scene (more friction between fear and compulsion) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas and Elara both feel specific and internally coherent: his ritualistic professionalism and guarded gentleness play cleanly against her desperate clinging to memory. Motivation is clear on both sides, and their micro-choices (her stillness, tremble, scream; his timing with the rocker, refusal to fix the image) are rooted in those motives. The shift in Elara from panicked attachment to “strange, hollow peace” is earned by the on-page experience, not hand-waved. I’d like one or two more glimpses of Silas’s own emotional cost to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivations are sharply defined—his contempt for priestly dogma and his need to prove reality through mechanics drive every action, from digging in the filth to obsessively filing the cog. Interiority is specific and characterful (lecturing rats on metaphysics, refusing to “calculate” emotion), giving him a distinct psychological texture. Internal contradiction is present but relatively light—his declared emotional detachment vs. his racing heart at the climax hints at deeper conflict that could be pushed further. Still, the final stance (starting a war via the clock) is clearly earned by the traits established from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to salvage harmony before it disappears—is vivid and consistent, and his occupation and history with the smashed instrument ground him. His endurance at the end reads as an Earned Stasis: he accepts a fleeting victory with visible sorrow. However, we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses in-scene; his desperation and resignation are asserted more than they are forced into collision by on-page choices. The students function as an undifferentiated mass rather than individual pressures, which slightly flattens relational dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is vivid, with a strong, character-specific sensibility (chef metaphors, informal aphorisms) and a clear motive rooted in his craft and ethics. His micro-choices—tasting, deciding the plant is too bitter, committing to painful pruning—track cleanly with who he is. What’s missing for a higher band is any real, dramatized inner conflict or hesitation; his course feels assured rather than pressured. The “death sentence” risk to him remains conceptual rather than embodied in his behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply drawn—his compulsive truth-telling and desire to “preserve wonder in routine” consistently motivate his choices, especially withholding the corrupted backup and forcing Kael to look at the dusk. Kael is somewhat thinner but still clear as a frantic technocrat clinging to his failed system. The internal conflict in Silas between civic responsibility and his selfish love of quiet lands effectively in the confession about enjoying maintenance cycles. Kael’s relatively quick emotional pivot at the end slightly softens the sense of hard-won cost between them.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand why some houses feel alive—is clear and governs every choice, from his nightly walks to his decision to “sanctify” the porch. His interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (tracking ambient volume, conceptualizing “hushed blaze”) rather than generic. The internal change at the end—reframing what animates a house—is earned by the preceding beats, though it lands more as an intellectual click than a deeply felt conflict with visible cost. The drunk fisherman functions as a brief, effective external pressure but doesn’t become a true relational crucible, keeping the character work strong rather than extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and misbelief are clear and drive the scene, and her shift from accusatory certainty to burdened responsibility feels earned by what she’s shown. The emotional life is mostly embodied (pressure of the deep, taste of air, grip on the ampoule) rather than labeled. Caelum’s role as patient, morally serious guide is consistent, though his own cost or fear is underdeveloped, keeping their dynamic a bit one-note. A touch more contradiction in Elara (personal stake beyond abstract justice) would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s motivation—escape as a way to reify a single missed moment—is specific and compelling, and his actions (choosing math over motion, risking annihilation) align cleanly with that drive. The “grim optimist” trait is dramatized through his refusal to despair in an infinite prison. However, internal conflict is more implied than felt; we’re told this is a terrifying gamble but see little moment-to-moment hesitation or contradiction in him. A bit more embodied fear or doubt at the dice-throw would deepen his humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, formative memory and a present-tense need to prove that kindness and shared “blood” still exist. His insomnia, exhaustion, and ritualistic discipline give him texture beyond a generic sensitive artist. The piece could deepen him further by showing a sharper internal contradiction under pressure (e.g., fear of not being answered versus compulsion to try) rather than mostly unwavering purpose. Nonetheless, his choices track tightly with his stated goal and pay off cleanly in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s motivation—to preserve cultural memory in a physically hostile environment—is vivid and consistent, and his choices (using the ancestral bread custom when the scrolls are doomed) are clearly rooted in that drive. Interiority is specific (“a steward of memory, a man historically oriented in a society that had no future”) and embodied through concrete acts like handling the lens and starter. Internal contradiction (terror of the thaw vs. calm, methodical response) is present but could be pushed further, especially in his emotional cost at letting the physical library go. The relationship to the refugees, especially the girl, is effective but lightly sketched; it works at this length but leaves some untapped potential.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s obsession and confidence are cleanly drawn, and his profession and “counter-clockwise” philosophy integrate well with his choice to literally unwind time. However, he faces almost no internal conflict or meaningful doubt, so we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or emotional cost. His motivation (defy fate, save villagers) is clear but not deeply personalized beyond professional obsession. The ending gives him triumph without a visible price, which limits the sense of earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: he wants to trick fear into revealing its weakness, driven by his post-resuscitation torment and ambivalence toward life. The internal contradiction—repulsion and attraction to death, fear and relief—feels embodied in lines like “a repulsive allure he could not resist” and the final confession. Micro-choices (following paradoxical instructions, fingering the clasp, choosing apathy over dread) all align with that motive. The Whispering Advisor is more atmospheric than psychologically developed, but it still adds a readable status dynamic and externalized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s core motivation (turning obstacles into instruments) is clear and consistently expressed through her choice to engage the storm rather than hide. We get some embodied emotion (taste of ozone, spray on her face, heaving chest), but her interiority remains more archetypal than individually conflicted—there’s little visible doubt or competing impulse under peak pressure. Her competence is high enough that failure rarely feels like a live emotional possibility. The final smile and quiet satisfaction are earned, but the cost to her feels mostly physical and lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s core motivation—understanding the turtles’ trajectory and her brother’s fate—is clear, consistent, and credibly leads her to risk blowing the whistle. Her professional lens as a “spiral-shell cartographer” is nicely specific and informs how she interprets the world. However, internal contradiction is light; aside from a brief hesitation before using the whistle, we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull between fear and drive. The final realization reweights her situation, but we don’t see a fully dramatized emotional cost or a new internal stance beyond shock and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s characterization as an emotionally controlled historian who both empathizes with the Censor’s motives and rejects the ongoing lie is clear, consistent, and drives her tactics (“processed that fear as a variable”). Her interiority is particular rather than generic, and her choices—stepping onto the tracks, crushing the petal, extending her hand—align with her values. The Censor has enough depth and fear to feel like a real obstacle rather than a straw man, and the power dynamic between them shifts credibly. The main limitation is that Elara’s internal conflict is intellectually articulated more than viscerally embodied, which sands off some potential complexity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation, ritual, and emotional life are well fused—his secret project grows credibly out of his sensitivity and professionalism. However, he is largely unconflicted: once his method is established, there’s little visible tension between duty and obsession or between self-preservation and this clandestine work. Emotional states are mostly inferred rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The piece ends in a stable, satisfying stance, but the cost of that stance for him personally is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation (logical, truth-driven, calm under pressure) is cleanly established and governs his choices, especially risking suffocation to test the stamp. His professional mindset—memorized coordinates, attention to microscopic vibrations—feels character-specific rather than generic. Internal conflict (truth vs survival) is present but could be deepened with a sharper sense of emotional cost once the prison-colony truth lands. The final decision to disseminate the truth is credible and earned, though rendered more as intellectual resolve than a fully embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to keep part of Elara with him and send it after her—is clear, specific, and embodied in his craft choices, and his grief is rendered through concrete action rather than labels. The lantern-maker detail and use of her dress as a polishing tool individualize him. Internal contradiction (need to hold on vs. having to let her go) is mostly implicit rather than dramatized in on-page vacillation, which keeps this just shy of top tier. Still, his final act of releasing the crane reads as an earned, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s trauma, obsession, and grief are sharply rendered, with clear motive rooted in the drone-strike backstory and a specific, math-tinged worldview. His contradictory impulses—exhilaration vs. despair, knowledge vs. self-destruction—surface most strongly in the ending when he reaches for the override again despite knowing the cost. There’s some label-heavy phrasing (“toxic hope,” “cold, hard truth”) that flattens what the images are already carrying. Still, his choices under pressure feel earned and particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—“decode the frequency of belonging” to fill her internal lack—is clear, specific, and sustained, with strong metaphors like “a sentence with the vowels removed” giving her interiority texture. Her competence as a pilot and tech operator is well embodied. The main weakness is limited real-time moral conflict around effectively killing the Pilgrim; the choice is compelling but comes a bit too cleanly, with little on-page hesitation or contradiction. The ending change (identity filled, cost accepted) is earned but could hit harder with more visible inner struggle at the moment of taking the chip.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation (to reclaim a buried truth) is specific and consistent, and his guilt is convincingly embodied in concrete actions (descending to the shore, handling dangerous driftwood, keeping the watch hand). The internal conflict between wanting to see himself as merciful and forcing himself to face his malpractice is clearly dramatized (“He needed to quell the urge to look away”). Emotional texture is rich and character-particular rather than generic. The only limitation, at this length and ambition, is the absence of a relational crucible on the page to further test and complicate him.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation is clear, specific, and tied to a concrete object—the drawer pull as a reminder of past failure—and his choices under pressure (interpreting the Commander’s exhaustion, lowering his hood, offering the improvised fix but letting the Commander turn it) all align with that. The internal tension between carrying his guilt and finally using it generatively then letting it go is present, though it could be dramatized more directly at the peak rather than mostly residing in concept. The Commander is sketched efficiently through physical detail and reaction, giving the relationship believable status dynamics in very little space. No major beat feels unmotivated, and the final renunciation of the object reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt, fear, and diminished self-concept are rendered with concrete, specific interiority (the compass as “accusation,” the physical recoil when he tries to navigate traditionally). His motives are clear and consistent: he wants safety yet feels compelled to perform a lost bravery, and his micro-choices (snapping the compass shut, choosing the poles) track that contradiction. The final endurance choice—accepting himself as “a pilgrim of the shallows”—reads as an earned stasis with cost. At times, the self-analysis edges toward explicit labeling (“broken navigator,” “grand navigator was gone”), but it remains grounded in on-page experience.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular: a numbed ex-assassin seeking to forcibly restore his own capacity for guilt. The apathy vs. emerging regret conflict culminates well in the baseball-throw choice, which feels earned by his prior history and the lake’s visions. However, his interiority early on leans more on exposition than dramatized contradiction under pressure, so his inner conflict only truly ignites late. The emotional breakthrough at the lake is strong but borders on tidy, with less irrationality or backsliding than a top-tier piece might show.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and specific—reforging a bond beyond death—and his reluctance to metamorphose provides genuine internal conflict under pressure. His embodied reactions to heat, pain, and transformation are concrete rather than generic. The final endurance choice (refusing to retreat as his body rewrites itself) is earned by prior setup and carries visible cost. The only slight limitation is that we see him in a single, high-flown register, with little sense of less-mythic flaws or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas’s motivation—recovering “lost time” with his daughter—is vivid, consistent, and pushes every on-page choice. The internal contradiction between his stated quest and his ultimate refusal to read the cards’ clear indictment is sharply dramatized rather than told. Embodied emotion (“tracing the empty spaces… with a shaking finger”) grounds the abstractions. The only slight limit is that his broader life beyond this guilt is sketched minimally, keeping his complexity somewhat single-axis.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s pacifism, terror of his own violent capacity, and quirky gravity-linked happiness create a specific, memorable interiority, and his choice to literally bind his shadow is well-motivated by that history. The story shows contradictory impulses—revulsion at violence vs. need to acknowledge it—operating simultaneously in the stitching sequence. Emotional states are embodied (nausea, rage, floating weightlessness) rather than just labeled. The only slight limitation is how smoothly the lifelong repression is resolved in a single ritual, which trims some potential messy ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s core motivation and history (merchant prince → destitute philanthropist) are vivid and consistently dramatized, and his willingness to give away everything but the crate is a clear, character-specific flaw/value. His charitable nature causally shapes the present (boots, delay) and the climax (releasing the bugs). However, he experiences little on-page contradictory impulse—he does not meaningfully resist surrendering the bugs—so internal conflict feels under-explored. The closing realization about surrender is earned but stated more conceptually than through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and method are clear and consistent—she’s the competent insider who has patiently engineered this moment, and her calm opportunism feels character-specific. Her motivation to “decouple the city from the central authoritarian grid” is cleanly embedded in her choices with no logical cheats. What’s missing at this echelon is embodied inner tension or visible emotional cost; she executes almost without doubt, fear, or conflict. The result is effective but somewhat one-note characterization rather than a fully pressurized inner arc.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Oren’s motive—honoring his mother’s promise and seeking an “anchor” in a frictionless world—is vivid and consistent, and his eel-herder isolation grounds his worldview. The precognitive curse gives him specificity and burden, though his contradictory impulses (dread of vision vs drive to act) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in conflicting in-the-moment choices. His emotional payoff at the end (weeping at stillness) feels earned by what we know of him. A relationship crucible is present but indirect (with his absent mother rather than an on-page character).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation (to reclaim suppressed truth and validate his memories) is clear and drives every action, and his interiority is specific rather than generic. The “furiously tranquil” contradiction is effective and embodied in his steady hands under a battering storm. The final shift from fear to wonder feels earned by what he sees on the map. The only limitation is that his internal conflict is mostly atmospheric; we don’t see him pushed to a sharply competing impulse or risky choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular—“to turn questions into destinations” is meaningfully dramatized through his approach to the duel and the cipher. His competence under pressure is convincing, with the mechanical arm and philosophical framing integrated into his choices. Internal contradiction is relatively light; he never feels truly torn between incompatible impulses, which keeps the emotional range somewhat narrow. The relationship with Kael has intriguing subtext but remains sketched rather than deeply transformed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply rendered through the personality-molting conceit and the shift from “Weeper” to “Architect,” and his bond with Silas feels lived-in and specific. Motivation is clean and character-particular—he wants to “forge beauty from anarchy”—and his actions align. However, internal contradiction is mostly summarized (past Weeper vs. present Architect) rather than dramatized in-scene as simultaneous impulses, which slightly flattens complexity. The psychological “engine of survival” idea is strong but could show more visible cost or micro-mistakes in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to steal a final encore from a collapsing reality—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices from staying in the station to entering the film. Interiority is tasteful and embodied (“victorious sorrow”), but his contradictions (fear vs. defiance, attachment vs. self-preservation) are more implied than fully dramatized in on-page struggle. The characterization leans slightly archetypal (the doomed, romantic artist), though rendered with care. The final stance—accepting the darkness as applause—feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s role, goal, and competence are sharply defined, and his methods under pressure (kaleidoscope, dream-interpretation, archaic syntax) reveal a distinct professional mindset. His temptation by the silver city and his lingering doubt at the end give him some interior contradiction rather than a simple hero mold. However, we learn almost nothing concrete about his personal life or particular history, which keeps him more emblematic than fully individuated. The final emotional cost—choosing harsh reality over consoling illusion—lands but could be deepened with one or two more character-specific tells.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is specific and textured—a bonsai tutor who measures life in branches and carries a “dense, black knot of guilt”—and his choice to risk a dangerous rite is clearly motivated. His embodied effort in the ritual (trembling, sweating, forcing remorse outward) feels credibly costly. However, the guilt remains generalized (brother’s laugh, wife’s sigh) and internal conflict is underdeveloped; he rarely seems torn, only burdened and resolved. A sharper articulation of contradictory impulses in the moment of risking the rite would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's specific intellectual background (neutron star research) rigorously shapes his perception, driving the narrative lens. The internal pivot from detached processing to "kindled humility" is earned through specific, on-page observation, resulting in a felt cost (the loss of his emotional shield).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s professional expertise in thermodynamics and viscosity effectively grounds her survival tactics, creating a highly competent and specific protagonist. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract self-analysis ("perception of the world was proving to be steadily adaptive") rather than embodied feeling, creating a slight emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and his backstory as a capsize survivor integrates well with his physical movement and internal struggle. However, his singular obsession is delivered via summary ("motivation was singular and obsessive") rather than emerging purely through action, and the trauma response is resolved somewhat tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is a distinct, consistent archetype ("weary undertaker") with a clear, if simple, motivation (silence). While his "stubbornness" is stated, the internal landscape is somewhat static; he performs a function rather than navigating a complex internal dilemma with a felt personal cost beyond physical fatigue. The characterization relies on his magical competency ("occupying impossible spaces") rather than a vulnerable, high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara serves more as a thematic mouthpiece than a contradictory individual; her primary trait is delivered via summary ("defined by being gently persistent") rather than dramatized choice. While her motivation is clear, she lacks the internal friction or distinct flaws required to elevate the characterization beyond a functional archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas is defined clearly by his profession and motivation, but his internal landscape feels functional rather than lived-in. The "past life memory" backstory serves as a convenient prompt-insert rather than a source of active, messy pressure in the present scene. The emotional realization at the end feels intellectual and tidy, lacking the visceral cost of a genuine character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian's motivation is clear and drives the action, but his internal landscape lacks the contradictory impulses required for depth; he moves from grief to "cure" without a moment of hesitation or conflicting desire regarding the memories he destroys. The "maze designer" trait functions primarily as a mechanical justification for the solution rather than a deep psychological lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a focused protagonist with clear agency and motivation rooted in a specific worldview. His physical constraint (the chain) is integrated well with his role as guardian, creating a strong image of endurance. The choice to sacrifice his safety for the future is earned, though his internal landscape is somewhat archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession is stated clearly ("motivation was singular"), but the narrative tells us of her drive rather than dramatizing a choice where she sacrifices something for it in the scene. She functions efficiently as a conduit for the process, lacking an internal contradiction or flaw that complicates the imprint. The "judgment of the sunken ships" implies isolation, but this cost feels ambient rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions more as a procedural vessel for the concept than a fully realized character; her motivation is delivered via narration ("metaphysical hunger") rather than dramatized through struggle. She obeys external instructions (flowers) and reacts to the climax ("sat frozen") rather than driving the scene through difficult active choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a vivid, specific protagonist whose performative dialogue ("Behold the extraction!") brilliantly dramatizes his coping mechanism for isolation. The internal transition from the theatrical "Artificer" persona to the frantic survivor is earned and psychologically consistent. The specific physical detail of his craft grounds the character well.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s transition from paralysis to agency is anchored well by the specific detail of his "defect" (amygdala), turning a weakness into a tool. However, the internal pivot where he "forced himself to remain firmly adaptive" feels slightly rushed and expository rather than purely dramatized. The "stunt double" identity provides a compelling context for his physical reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal focus is sharp, and her dedication to the ritual provides a strong narrative spine. However, the attribute "mildly obsessed" creates a tonal friction with the "absolute and terrifying" stakes, feeling slightly disjointed from the otherwise apocalyptic gravity of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the micro-choices (scanning rather than incinerating). The internal contradiction between his janitorial function and metaphysical curiosity is well-dramatized through the "defect," though the "curious robot" trope is familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian's motivation is clear but delivered via explicit narrator summary ("his motivation was singular and terrifying") rather than implicit action. While the internal longing to "broadcast love" is a distinct trait, the emotional shift from suspicion to shared burden feels rushed and aided by the telepathic setting rather than earned through complex character friction. The "learning to love" trope is handled earnestly, but the explanatory interiority distances the reader from the raw feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian is a compelling protagonist whose backstory of fraud deepens the present action, turning a simple task into an act of redemption. The motivation is clear and embodied, though the narrative occasionally relies on telling ("for he was wisely pragmatic") rather than letting the silence speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian is a sharply drawn protagonist whose duality—obliging exterior vs. radical interior—drives the narrative. His motivation is palpable, and the internal cost of his obsession is well-rendered. The final emotional pivot, accepting the secret warmth over public validation, feels earned and consistent with his established character.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias functions primarily as a vessel for the atmospheric concept rather than a fully realized character. His motivation is attributed to an external "compulsion" and "lately inspired" energy rather than organic desire, reducing agency. While his background as a musician informs the ending, his interiority relies on abstract descriptors ("disciplined mind," "feverish creativity") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a distinct, high-concept protagonist whose bio-digital nature serves as the mechanic for the resolution, not just flavor. His internal conflict—between core programming and the moral necessity of the "swallowed truth"—is dramatized effectively in the decision to "smudge" the data rather than delete it or speak it, revealing a character-specific hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas has a distinct voice and consistent internal logic, but his primary motivation is delivered via expository summary ("motivation was singular and heavy") rather than dramatized conflict. The connection between his past negligence and the current setting feels constructed, and his epiphany is internal and relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara is a functional vessel for the narrative, but her interiority relies heavily on explicit labels ("Her motivation was singular and simple") rather than embodied struggle. The moment her "arthritis vanished" removes physical cost, and her "loose grip on reality" is told to the reader before being briefly shown, reducing the impact of her unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("mellow music therapist") and expository interiority rather than dramatized contradiction. Elias functions as a benevolent vehicle for the plot without personal risk or internal struggle. The emotional arc is straightforward and lacks the friction of competing desires required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian functions primarily as a vessel for observation rather than an agent of dramatic choice. While his motivation is stated ("collect the stories walls have heard"), he faces no internal opposition or difficult trade-offs; he simply arrives, perceives, and succeeds. The lack of embodied cost or conflicting impulses makes him feel like a camera with a backstory rather than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arthur’s dilemma is compelling, and the "accidental prophecy" trait adds distinct, high-stakes pressure to his vocation. However, the pivot moment relies on summarized internal reporting ("He realized with sudden clarity," "His deep-seated motivation now was") rather than dramatized psychological struggle, creating a layer of distance between the reader and the character's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kellen is drawn with strong professional competence, but he lacks internal conflict or personal stakes. He operates as a flawless technician without vulnerability, doubt, or a distinct personal cost, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Silas is a coherent focalizer with a unique specific ambition, but his internal landscape feels diagnostic ("chronologically homesick") rather than vividly dramatized through conflicting impulses. The character functions more as a vessel for the high concept than a human making difficult choices under pressure; his "struggle" is abstract and resolved without a clear emotional or behavioral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Character motivation is viscerally embodied; the "gravity defier" trait functions beautifully as a symptom of existential fragmentation rather than a superpower. The internal conflict between the safety of drifting and the "crushing, beautiful burden" of reality drives a decisive, earned closure. The protagonist's agency is paramount in the final beat, transforming a physical landing into a metaphysical commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's disability is well-embodied through tactile sensory details, but his internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("profound emotional numbness," "apathy") rather than dramatized behavior. The climax is endured rather than driven by a new choice, making the emotional release feel chemically induced rather than earned by character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect data is clear, but her decision to prioritize the pigeon while under immediate siege strains credibility, feeling like a plot device rather than a survival choice. The internal logic holds together through the lens of her "scientific mind," but the survival instinct feels momentarily dampened to serve the prompt. Her reaction to the destruction of her work—detached preservation of the truth—strongly anchors her character at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's desperation is embodied in the reckless micro-choice to remove her respirator, prioritizing knowledge over safety. This action vividly demonstrates her internal conflict and drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas has a clear, elevated motivation that drives the plot, and the final renunciation is well-earned. However, interiority often relies on abstract labels ("ethically playful demeanor," "passionate subtlety") rather than embodied emotional experience, which distances the reader during the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a complex character; her motivation is explicitly told ("Her sole motivation was to...") rather than revealed through struggle. The description of her sensitivity ("bordered on physical pain") is stated as a trait but does not force a visible trade-off or difficult choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    Silas functions as a competent archetype rather than a conflicted protagonist; his professional thoroughness and "affectionate detachment" are stated labels rather than dramatized struggles. He faces no significant internal opposition or risk, performing his role with static efficiency. The "static electricity" sense offers a nice embodied trait, but without a test of his values, he remains a facilitator of Elara's arc rather than a driver of his own.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on exposition ("specific motivation was to uplift silent contributors") rather than dramatized struggle. The protagonist's internal state is signaled through stock physical cues ("knuckles white") and declared emotions ("terrified") that do not fully align with the smooth, competent interaction that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation to "graft" herself onto the community is clear and drives the scene. However, the collective antagonist (the group) yields too easily; their "mute stoicism" breaks instantly upon her hum, reducing the felt difficulty of her struggle. The internal landscape is vivid but occasionally leans on abstract labels like "luminescent ache" rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and drives every on-page choice, leading to a climax where she trades lifespan for her art. The physical cost of the magic (aging, white hair) is immediate and embodied, grounding the high-concept stakes in her body. Her professional competence is convincing, though internal conflict is limited to the transactional calculation of survival versus success.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, but the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ambiguous loss," "buried optimism") rather than embodied experience. The "gnawing motivation" is stated more than felt in the scene's pressure, though the ritual actions provide some character grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is distinct and clearly dramatized; the tension between Elias's need for safety and his yearning for connection drives the plot. The "kindly methodical" attribute is not merely a label but acts as a physical constraint on his movement, reinforcing his reverence for the building. His internal conflict is resolved through action rather than summary, landing a satisfying emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character voice is distinct and "circuitously sincere," blending scientific detachment with panic. However, the narrative occasionally over-diagnoses his interior state ("avoided stating the naked truth") rather than letting the subtext stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's obsession drives a high-stakes choice (trading survival for art) that creates a defined hierarchy of values. However, interiority relies occasionally on labeled emotion ("felt a haggard awe") rather than purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than an agent; her internal arc is resolved by an external force ("the universe was correcting her vision") rather than active struggle. The epiphany feels didactic and imposed, lacking the contradictory impulses or embodied resistance required for high-band characterization. Her shift from arrogance to humility is a stated outcome rather than a dramatized process.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elian functions as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; his interiority is conveyed through abstract summaries ("scattered data points") rather than embodied emotion or conflict. There is no internal struggle or contradiction, and his competence is absolute, removing the potential for character-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but the climax relies on "diagnostic label-speak" (labeling her mapping as a "defense mechanism against... intimacy") rather than dramatized emotion. The realization is summarized as a psychological diagnosis, distancing the reader from the felt cost of the moment. The internal conflict is stated more than it is performed in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara's skepticism is established by label ("sympathetic skeptic") rather than behavior, and she abandons it instantly upon seeing the pattern, lacking genuine internal resistance. The "risk to her academic standing" is expository and abstract, failing to generate felt pressure or drive a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear, but the emotion is summarized ("spirit eroded," "bored immortal") rather than embodied in specific behavior or sensory detail before the climax. The transition to "pure loss" feels unearned because the character's internal state is largely conveyed through abstract labels.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    Vance's transformation is chemically induced by the ink rather than earned through interaction, reducing him to a responsive prop. Julian's motivation is stated ("mathematics of a fair trade") but the "honest" trait clashes with the manipulative nature of the magical solution, creating a gap between the label and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a competent executor of a process rather than a character with internal contradiction or depth. While her professional expertise is clear, she lacks a distinct internal struggle or a micro-choice that reveals character beyond simple proficiency. The "burning curiosity" is stated but not dramatized through risk or deviation from the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is distinct, but the character operates without internal contradiction or struggle, acting as a flawless vessel for the concept. The emotional cost is asserted ("constructed sorrow") rather than embodied in a difficult choice or renunciation, leaving the protagonist feeling more like a function than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s transition from skeptic to participant is compelling and his "gloomy cheerfulness" adds specific emotional texture. However, the pivotal emotional realization relies on summarized reports of the voices rather than a dramatized confrontation, distancing the reader from the cost at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is a competent, distinct protagonist with a clear role and skill set. However, her "dual allegiance" is stated rather than deeply felt as an internal conflict; she executes the plan with high competence and minimal on-page emotional cost or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a distinct, motivated protagonist whose internal state is effectively externalized through the sand grain. The conflict between his official role and his curiosity is enacted rather than just stated, creating a strong character arc within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias functions as a static archetype of the "master artisan," executing his task with flawless competence but lacking internal conflict or contradiction. While his sensory experience is well-rendered, he faces no genuine struggle or character-testing choice; he simply applies skill to a problem and succeeds without personal cost or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas is a distinct, sharply realized protagonist whose professional background ("correcting the world's geometry") perfectly tensions with the metaphysical plot. The "Show-off" beat reveals a specific, dry-witted interiority that grounds the magical elements. The final choice to leave the ledger blank is a character-specific renunciation earned by his respect for the "unprintable" truth.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    Silas functions as a competent archetype rather than a fully realized character with internal contradictions or distinct blind spots. While his expertise is established, he encounters no genuine doubt or internal friction; he identifies the problem and solves it without a personal cost beyond minor physical exertion. The lack of vulnerability or a difficult micro-choice limits emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s internal conflict between survival instinct and duty is dramatized effectively through the physical struggle. The final choice to accept death ("content to become part of the signal") is a strong Earned Stasis that feels motivated by her established reverence for the history.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s internal state and the burden of his legacy are articulated clearly, giving weight to his isolation. However, his motivation is stated ("singular and consuming") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the lack of on-page interaction until the very end limits the demonstration of his traits under social pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear (survival), but the climax relies on diagnostic summarization ("sole motivation was to repay a debt," "transaction was complete") rather than embodied interaction. The protagonist's final emotion is labeled ("mournful elation") rather than demonstrated through specific action or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the magic system than a conflicted protagonist; the "trance" mechanic removes her consciousness during the climax, erasing agency and internal struggle at the pivotal moment. Her optimism is stated rather than tested by the "lethal" environment, resulting in a lack of embodied friction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara serves primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted individual; her motivation is clear, but her journey lacks internal resistance or contradictory impulses. The emotional arc is smooth and frictionless, with no moment where her competence or faith is genuinely tested by the environment or her own limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian is a consistent focalizer with a clear role, but he functions more as an archetype than a dynamic character. His internal state is described through thematic assertions ("anchor in a world...") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or contradictory impulse under pressure. He performs his task with competence, but faces no significant internal obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa’s dual nature is executed with precision; the transition from trembling senility to steely competence is sharp and satisfying. Her motivation is deeply felt and integrated into her craft ("unheard stories"), though Kael serves as a somewhat stock antagonist with melodramatic markers like "sneer" and "hissed."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Julian’s internal motivation is clear and grounded in a specific regret, but his emotional arc relies on external validation rather than an internal crucible. Elara functions as a convenient expository device rather than a fully realized character, delivering diagnostic lines that explain the protagonist's state to him.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but his interiority relies heavily on stated motivation ("motivation tonight was not just to translate, but to graft...") rather than subtext. The attribute "shrewdly innocent" appears as a label rather than an embodied behavior. While the internal conflict is clear, the resolution feels intellectualized rather than viscerally earned through character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("rediscover lost joy") rather than dramatized through pressure or choice. The character experiences no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she simply enters the dream, succeeds, and feels better. The emotion is summarized ("deep sense of amusement") rather than embodied in reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian is a clearly defined protagonist whose weariness with certainty effectively motivates the plot. While his internal state is well-rendered, he functions somewhat as a cipher for the thematic concept rather than a fully fleshed-out individual with deep contradictions. The transition into the "carver" persona adds necessary texture to his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.5)
    Julian reads as a stock "charming rogue" archetype rather than a complex individual; his dialogue ("candidly cryptic") feels performed and lacks genuine vulnerability under pressure. The internal landscape is low-friction; he maintains a "lopsided grin" and witty banter while facing capture, creating an emotional distance that undermines the stakes. The "cost" of his defiance is stated in backstory ("twelve good men") rather than felt in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated as a duty to "photosynthesize pain," but this intellectualized framing distances the reader from the raw grit of grief. The emotional landscape relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("toxic isotope," "biological alchemy") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses, resulting in a performance of sorrow rather than a felt struggle. While the choice to bury the postcard is definitive, the lack of internal hesitation or resistance makes the decision feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian functions competently as a guardian archetype, but his internal landscape lacks friction or contradiction. The "foxglove regret" feels like a labeled emotion rather than a dramatized state, and his choices are procedural (fix the break) rather than moral or costly. He faces no significant trade-off or temptation to abandon his post, resulting in a static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and driving, but the emotional climax relies on "therapy-speak" declarations ("I promise to witness your pain") that feel artificial for the character's arcane establishment. Kael remains largely reactive until the final beat, limiting the dynamic range of the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian is a competent, active protagonist whose skills drive the resolution. However, the backstory discovery of the "microscopic lattice" in the glue leans heavily on convenient techno-magic rather than grounded ingenuity, slightly weakening the realism of his expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian's motivation and distinct worldview are well-established, but the pivotal shift from deep-seated paranoia to trust happens too rapidly. The transition relies on a single observation of "exhaustion" in the antagonist's eyes, resolving the central interpersonal conflict with convenient speed rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara functions well as a focalizer for the concept, though she feels more like a thematic vessel than a flesh-and-blood protagonist. Her motivation ("to discover why some thresholds feel sacred") is abstract and philosophical, lacking a visceral, embodied anchor until the final action. The connection to her father provides necessary grounding, but her interiority often drifts into essayistic reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara's internal state is distinct, though her motivation ("rhythm of belonging") leans on abstract labeling rather than dramatized friction. Her emotional reactions use stock cues like "breath hitching," which flattens the specific texture of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear, but the character reads more as an archetype than a person with contradictory impulses. The climax relies on a "guess" (conjecture) rather than an earned insight derived from established traits or struggle, reducing agency to luck.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear obsession, but he functions more as a plot device than a character under pressure. His omnipotent competence and lack of internal conflict or meaningful cost limit the emotional resonance; he succeeds too easily without struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a complex character; her motivation is stated ("slow, dry suffocation") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The "lethal power" and "obsidian grace" are attributed via exposition rather than demonstrated in action or interaction. There is no internal doubt or moment of hesitation to give weight to the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's internal state is richly detailed, but he functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure; the anxiety is stated ("noise of his own anxieties") rather than dramatized through resistance or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("surrendered his capacity for blind hope") rather than embodied reaction. The shift from bitterness to acceptance feels intellectualized through the reflection beat rather than earned through emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian is a static archetype of competence who faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. He performs a procedure without hesitation or emotional struggle, lacking the "blind spots," "limits," or "visible cost" required for higher bands. The "logical dreamer" trait functions as a label rather than a source of conflict or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and diagnostic labeling ("sensitively perceptive," "professional detachedness was a lie") rather than dramatized choice. Elias functions as an observer; his empathy is stated as a "curse" but does not force a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a magical device rather than a character with interiority or struggle; her motivation is stated but not felt through personal stakes or cost. The target character is a passive prop until the final magical intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on archetypes (the sneering general, the fragile matriarch) and unearned emotional pivots. The transition from hardened warlords to weeping parents occurs in a single beat without sufficient resistance or internal struggle, making the emotions feel performed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's core contradiction—ruthless pragmatism versus sentimental preservation—is compelling and drives the central action. However, the opening relies on diagnostic labeling ("amoral philanthropist," "secretly sentimental") rather than dramatizing these traits purely through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara's definition as a "chaste courtesan" effectively frames her rebellion (withholding vs. the system's taking). However, the transition from this social role to the magical mechanics of "untangling threads" feels slightly disjointed, relying on simile ("precision of a lover") rather than a concrete skill transfer. The cost paid at the end (giving away hoarded intimacy) is conceptually strong but summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas is a static cipher for a philosophical position rather than a character under pressure; his "serenity" is a label that is never tested by genuine opposition. The antagonist (the heckler) is reduced to a passive prop ("slumped and mute") before the performance even peaks, removing the friction necessary for character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a functional vessel for the theme rather than a breathing character; his "esoteric realist" worldview is told via label rather than shown through conflicted choice. While his physical actions (tying the knot) are specific, his internal landscape is summarized with abstract emotions ("shame of a world") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's internal state is summarized via exposition ("forgiving himself," "snowmelt ardor") rather than dramatized through conflicted action or subtext. He begins the scene fully "ready" to make the sacrifice, leaving no room for a decision-making arc or emotional cost to play out on the page. Motivation is clear but static, lacking the contradictory impulses required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s temporal condition is a compelling constraint that uniquely shapes the narrative perspective and tension. However, the motivation "to discover why some paths choose their walkers" feels abstract and slightly disconnected from the visceral survival stakes until the final pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Bel-ibni’s parsimony is well-dramatized through specific, defining actions (extinguishing torches, saving chalk). However, the initial characterization relies heavily on expository summary ("He was a man who viewed waste...") rather than allowing the behavior to fully carry the trait without the label.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist operates as a functional archetype ("scheming pacifist") rather than a fully realized character, relying on a magical object to bypass genuine interaction. The antagonist's transformation is chemically induced via "cellular memory" rather than earned through dramatized internal struggle or agency. The resolution feels imposed by the author's hand rather than emerging from the characters' conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is a competent, distinct focalizer with a clear objective and specific internal landscape. The motivation ("a life unlived") serves as a compelling hook, though it remains somewhat abstract; the emotional weight of this lost life is asserted rather than dramatized through specific memory or pain, making his risk-taking feel more technical than desperate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara is a distinct, proactive protagonist with clear internal logic linking her daughter to the magic. However, the characterization suffers from "telling" via the pasted prompt phrase "endearingly feisty woman" rather than trusting the dramatized action, and the motivation regarding "generational wisdom" feels slightly abstract compared to the immediate physical threat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s internal state is clearly rendered through his reaction to the sensory overload and the absurd weight of the task. The transition from feeling like a "punchline" to accepting the "phantom weight" of agency is well-earned within the short space. The specific habit regarding bathrooms grounds the high-concept premise in character quirk.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is a highly competent protagonist whose specific skills drive the plot, but she functions more as a problem-solver than a character undergoing deep internal change. While her motivation is clear, the lack of significant personal cost or internal conflict limits the emotional resonance of her arc; the emotional weight is largely externalized to the Traveler.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("acutely aware," "singular and bordering on madness") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final emotional shift feels stated ("felt a surge of affection") rather than earned through struggle or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elian functions as a competent plot device rather than a character with internal depth or struggle. His motivation is stated as "absolute" but never tested by doubt or conflicting desires, resulting in a flat trajectory. He solves the crisis without making a difficult choice or suffering a personal cost, leaving his characterization purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara displays strong competence and clear motivation rooted in survival. However, the emotional arc is linear, and the cost of her victory is limited to physical exhaustion rather than a difficult internal trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; her motivation is explicitly stated ("driven by a singular, obsessive motivation") rather than revealed through conflicting desires. While she performs the necessary actions, she lacks internal contradiction or a moment of costly choice, making her feel more like a plot device than a living protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("complex grief," "preemptively nostalgic") rather than embodied experience. While the final resolve is earned, the emotional friction feels somewhat filtered through abstract definitions of her role rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian is a competent archetype who performs his role without internal friction or doubt. While his motivation is clear ("defy gravity of hopelessness"), he lacks a "crucible" moment where his character is tested; he simply succeeds at his trade.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is a consistent, grounded protagonist whose profession shapes her worldview effectively. However, her "wise mentor" competence resolves the internal conflict too smoothly; the emotional struggle of losing her legacy is intellectualized rather than deeply felt in the moment, reducing the weight of her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and links backstory to present action. However, her internal state is largely summarized ("birthed a sharp paradox") rather than dramatized through conflicting choices in the moment. She operates with perfect competence, making her feel more like a vessel for the concept than a complex agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian is a competent professional with no internal conflict or flaws. He identifies a problem and solves it instantly with a tool, lacking genuine struggle or doubt. The emotional arc belongs entirely to Kael, leaving the protagonist static and purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on direct labeling ("her nature wisely adventurous") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Elara faces external obstacles but no internal conflict, and her transition from Keeper to Ruler lacks emotional cost or earned growth.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s internal state is clear, but Elian functions more as a symbolic device than a fully realized character, serving primarily to facilitate her realization. The emotional arc relies on his intervention rather than a purely internal struggle, making the resolution feel somewhat guided rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor deftly informs his tactical response to the metaphysical threat, creating a cohesive character arc. The shift from hiding to volunteering is rapid but justified by his specific "coping mechanisms" and desire to transmute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is singular and drives the action effectively, fitting the &quot;dynasty ender&quot; archetype. However, the character lacks on-page contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices; the reliance on &quot;intuition&quot; to solve the central puzzle bypasses deeper intellectual or emotional struggle, leaving him competent but somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is singular and drives the scene, but the "tragic history" remains an abstract label rather than a felt weight, making the final renunciation feel relatively frictionless. The protagonist moves through the ritual with competence, but the internal cost of "forsaking vows" is asserted more than dramatized in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer with a clear objective, but his emotional state is often delivered via label-heavy adjectives ("permanently broken-hearted," "spirit eroded") rather than embodied reaction. While his micro-choice at the end is motivated, the "reverence of a grave keeper" feels like a persona summary rather than a lived experience on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with a clear motivation and consistent traits (age, invisibility). However, her "underestimated rebel" persona relies on standard tropes, and her internal life is largely asserted through exposition rather than dramatized through complex, contradictory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a competent, professional protagonist whose actions directly drive the plot. While his physical exertion and the lingering "nostalgia" provide some textured interiority, he lacks a contradictory internal impulse or a difficult choice between competing values; he simply executes his duty. The characterization is functional and fits the weird-fiction archetype well, but the emotional cost feels somewhat labeled rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    Silas functions as a competent procedural role rather than a character with depth. He lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict; his actions are perfectly aligned with his desires, resulting in a linear execution of duty without hesitation or difficult choices. The "trembling anticipation" is stated but not earned through struggle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's arc is legible, but the internal epiphany relies on diagnostic telling ("desire to freeze time") rather than embodied realization. The motivation to "befriend uncertainty" feels slightly abstract and imposed rather than organic to the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is consistent and competent, but her motivation is overly intellectualized ("theorized," "equations") rather than viscerally felt. The lack of struggle or error makes her feel more like a function of the magic system than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian functions as a competent device rather than a character under pressure; he executes a plan without hesitation, internal conflict, or personal risk. His "modestly fearless" attribute effectively immunizes him against the antagonist's pressure, preventing any meaningful struggle or hard choices. The emotional arc belongs entirely to the ghost, leaving the protagonist static and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s somatic experience is visceral and distinct, grounding the narrative in a specific physical reality ("precise rotation of his axis"). However, the intellectual motivation ("mathematics of mercy") feels slightly imposed and abstract compared to the organic immediacy of the trauma responses, creating a slight disconnect between the character's primal state and his philosophical goal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian acts as a competent functionary of the magic system; his "devout" motivation is stated but lacks the friction of a counter-impulse or a high-stakes trade-off on the page. He succeeds through established expertise rather than character-defining struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct, highly competent protagonist whose vocational expertise anchors the story, but his journey lacks internal conflict or a significant high-stakes trade-off. While his endurance of the spectral pressure serves as a form of agency, his success feels inevitable due to his immediate mastery of the situation. The "singular motivation" is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas is a focused, archetypal protagonist with a clear motivation ("compress eternity"), but he lacks the internal contradiction required for higher bands. His drive is singular and unchallenged by doubt or conflicting desires, making him function more as a force of nature than a complex character under pressure. The absence of a "blind spot" or an on-page choice between competing values limits the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian functions well as a thematic archetype, but his interiority relies on elevated labels ("vessel of burnished sorrow") rather than embodied psychological nuance. Thorne serves as a static foil without sufficient agency to truly pressure Elian's choices, leaving the central relationship somewhat one-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a functional archetype serving the allegorical premise rather than a deeply embodied character. While his fear is stated ("trembling palm"), the internal conflict is resolved too neatly through a moment of "steeling his mind" without complex psychological friction or contradictory impulses. The resolution relies on his "purity of intent," which reads more like fable logic than character-driven agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.6)
    Silas is a functional archetype (the obsessed collector) rather than a fully realized character; his motivation is declared via exposition ("lifelong compulsion") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. He faces no internal opposition or doubt, and his success requires no personal sacrifice or evolution, leaving him static from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is explicitly stated ("knew her motivation was...") rather than dramatized through friction. While she acts decisively, she lacks internal conflict or a distinct flaw, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and directs the narrative, but her interiority relies heavily on summary and labeling ("quietly driven," "intense and obscure") rather than dramatized struggle. The shift from vanity to survival is intellectually coherent but feels emotionally distant because the "lucrative public commissions" are never shown exerting pressure on the page. The epiphany arrives as a stated realization rather than a visceral experience of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is a functional protagonist whose motivation ("uncover truth") drives the plot but lacks internal contradiction or specific personal stakes. Her emotional reactions, such as tears evaporating instantly, feel slightly stock rather than embodied. The negotiation aligns perfectly with her desires—she wants to preserve history, he wants to be remembered—stripping the moment of a hard choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully distinct; her choice to reimagine civilization with "greed, hunger, and ambition" reveals a complex, philosophical interiority that rejects easy utopias. The mental cost of her action is viscerally embodied ("mind feeling as though it were being flayed"), grounding her competence in genuine struggle. Her contradictory impulse—desiring life but ensuring it remains painful—elevates the character work significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vane is a distinct focalizer whose specific skill set (dead languages) and history (preservationist training) drive the resolution. His internal state moves credibly from professional habit to existential dread, anchoring the high-concept plot in character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elian’s shift from custodial duty to the existential theft of "borrowed time" provides a compelling internal arc that charges the ending. However, the specific trait "furiously tranquil" appears as a told label rather than a dramatized state of conflicting impulses during the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Character motivation drives the central choice and connects consistently to the backstory of the "humble tester." However, the interiority relies on direct telling ("His deepest motivation was to favor listening") rather than purely dramatized friction. The connection to the "phantom tension of centuries of monks" feels slightly romanticized and distant from the immediate technical crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character with conflicting impulses. Motivation is explicitly diagnosed by the narrator ("Her motivation was singular and profound") rather than dramatized through struggle or choice. The internal arc resolves instantly through a ritual without visible psychological cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias is a distinct, motivated protagonist with a clear worldview. His refusal to engage with the ghost is well-motivated by his philosophy. However, the narration occasionally externalizes his interiority (describing his own expression as that of an "astonished recluse"), which creates a slight distancing effect preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with a unique physiological stake ("skin hummed with static"), but her motivation is delivered via exposition ("Primary motivation... was to understand") rather than emerging solely from action. While her internal state is clear, the brevity prevents deeper exploration of her "borrowed time" dilemma beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian functions as a competent sage archetype without internal friction or doubt; his expertise is absolute, making the conflict feel like a technical puzzle rather than a personal crucible. The lack of contradictory impulses reduces the emotional cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but his interiority relies on stated labels ("brazen calm," "did not fear") rather than embodied emotion or struggle. He faces no internal conflict or hesitation; the execution is procedural, lacking a moment where his character is tested beyond physical endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious") rather than enacted traits, which creates emotional distance. Her internal state feels intellectualized ("biological betrayal"), reducing the visceral impact of the "pull" she supposedly fights. While the interaction with Aris provides a necessary foil, she remains largely a vehicle for the premise rather than a living character. The "relationship as crucible" dynamic is present but relies on a brief, static exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas functions as a vessel for the ritual rather than a fully realized character; his motivation is summarized via diagnostic labeling ("motivation was singular and obsessive") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. He encounters no internal resistance or meaningful choice, performing the task with perfect competence and no hesitation, which flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is a compelling protagonist with a distinct sensory shift (olfactory to visual) that anchors the narrative. His motivation is palpable, but his ability to visually decode audio waves with a shard of glass borders on "competence porn," reducing the sense of genuine struggle. The emotional arc is clear, though the resolution feels more like a puzzle solved than a character tested to their limit.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal state is distinct, and the transition from survivor to explorer is a clear arc. However, the pivot relies on summarized interiority ("A shift occurred in her chest," "She realized") rather than embodied reaction, making the emotional change feel slightly observed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on direct labeling ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") rather than dramatized behavior. Elian lacks internal conflict or a credible struggle; he is a vehicle for the plot's execution without distinct personality traits beyond the prompt's requirements. His motivation is stated in summary ("Elian’s motivation was to embrace the unknown") rather than revealed through pressure or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer whose backstory as a crisis actor rigorously informs his present method ("script and a scar"). The internal conflict between his natural empathy and the "benevolently ruthless" stoicism required to archive grief is dramatized beautifully in the walking of the "V" and "S." His agency drives the narrative from the specific method of recording to the climactic intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation to find "home" is clear, but her internal conflict—fear of her "buried talents"—resolves somewhat conveniently through the discovery of magical objects rather than deep emotional struggle. The character functions primarily as a vessel for the plot's fetch-quest logic, though her blindness and mercury glass provide a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, though the transition from ruthless tutor to savior relies heavily on expository backstory rather than dramatized shifts. The protagonist's internal state is articulated through summary ("guilt of the sacrificed pawns") rather than embodied reaction, making the emotional arc feel calculated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaelen functions as a symbolic archetype rather than a nuanced character; he lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. His motivation is clear, but his emotional state is static ("innocently mischievous" to "satisfied"), and he faces the prospect of exile with a stoicism that feels unearned on the page. The "trickster" persona is stated more than it is developed through complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal state is tracked clearly through the crisis, though the transition from "paralyzing fear" to decisive action is slightly rushed. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("Her motivation was singular...") rather than purely dramatized, but her physical endurance under pressure anchors the character well.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer, but his grief follows a somewhat stock trajectory without the jagged, irrational edges of genuine loss. The "intimately aloof" trait is summarized in the exposition rather than dramatized through interaction or specific avoidance on the page. His internal state is articulated through polished, essayistic thought ("defiance against the entropy") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias's interiority relies on described intensity ("screaming tenderness," "physical wound") rather than dramatized struggle. The head keeper is a convenient caricature of authority used solely to contrast with the protagonist's philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions primarily as a competent vessel for the ritual rather than a dynamic agent with conflicting desires; her "patchwork" nature is asserted through labels ("stitched-together maps") rather than distinct behavioral choices. While she endures the physical heat of the censer, the lack of hesitation or tactical variation makes the characterization feel static. The connection between her scars and the "geography of loss" reads as thematic exposition rather than dramatized internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear internal conflict between his rational nature and his desperate need for an irrational cure. While the "involuntary truthfulness" is compelling, it functions primarily as told backstory motivation rather than being dramatized via an on-page interaction where he is forced to speak a truth that harms him. The resolution—lying to himself—is a strong character beat that proves the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is a clearly drawn archetype with consistent internal motivation ("compulsion"). The physical details (ink-stained fingers, trembling) ground him well, though the narrative relies on telling his emotional state ("burning motivation," "felt a compulsion") rather than dramatizing it through action until the end. His shift in perspective regarding his duty is a functional character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is compelling, and the final shift from attempting to alter history to witnessing it provides a meaningful trajectory. However, the pivotal realization ("realized the promise wasn't to change the past") arrives via summary assertion rather than a dramatized beat of internal struggle, which softens the emotional cost of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Isolde’s weariness and transition to stewardship are well-rendered, with interiority that matches the mythic tone. The shift from queen to guardian is earned through the climb, though the moment of realization relies slightly on external prompts (the insects) rather than purely internal struggle. The relationship with Valerius provides a necessary foil but remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation is abstract but grounded effectively by the specific emotional catalyst of Kaelen’s departure. The internal cost—the "sudden hollow in his chest"—is embodied and felt, elevating the alchemist archetype beyond a mere functionary. Kaelen serves primarily as a catalyst, but the intimacy of the trust is convincingly established in a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract internal states ("feral nostalgia," "chronologically confused") rather than dramatized choice or behavior. While the "jealousy" mechanic is a unique trait, the character functions more as a vessel for the prompt's concepts than a person navigating a crucible. The emotional arc is stated in summary ("I resent that younger man") rather than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characterization is distinct, with Elias's sensory loss providing a clear lens for interaction. However, the narrative relies on diagnostic telling to convey internal states (e.g., "anxiety that had nothing to do with mechanics and everything to do with obsolescence"), which abstracts emotion rather than embodying it in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to transform scars into stories") is delivered via exposition rather than dramatized through behavior, and the shift from academic to superstitious feels functional rather than earned by deep struggle. However, the physical manifestation of her flaw (crystallization) effectively externalizes the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is a distinct, weary protagonist, and his cynicism contrasts well with the client's raw need. However, the narrative scaffold explaining his trait ("He was fond of advising through metaphors...") distances the reader by telling rather than letting the dialogue stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated as a duty to "unravel cosmic illusions," but it operates more as a job description than a deep psychological drive. Her interiority is largely expository, explaining the mechanics of the glitch rather than dramatizing a personal struggle or contradictory impulse. The "trembling hands" offer a stock physical cue for fear, but her competence feels unthreatened, making her an efficient functionary rather than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s obsession is viscerally embodied, and his contradictory impulses (fluidity vs. gears) drive the narrative engine. The choice to engage the mechanism carries distinct, dramatized cost ("serrated blade sawing against his vision"), earning the final renunciation. A slight reliance on summary for the epiphany ("He realized with horror") rather than purely dramatized realization prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias's motivation is stated clearly via summary ("desperate need to understand the physics of letting go") but feels abstract rather than viscerally driven by the immediate scene. The transition from a decades-long obsession with walls to dismantling them occurs abruptly in a single beat ("tension... demand for change"). While the internal conflict is legible, the "spatially gifted" attribute acts more as a label than a constraint that shapes his specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elena's characterization is distinct, anchored well by the contrast with her gambler father. However, her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("dopamine rush," "strict laws") rather than embodied emotion, and her final acceptance feels asserted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas acts as a clear, consistent agent with specific skills and a defined philosophy; while his function as a healer is well-dramatized, his personal stake or internal cost remains somewhat abstract, making him feel more like a narrative device than a fully vulnerable character.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is a clearly defined, active protagonist who drives the ritual, and the shift from "widow" to "guardian" provides a complete arc. However, the absence of conflicting impulses or hesitation during the ritual leaves her internal landscape largely static; she executes a plan without confronting a difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.7)
    Arthur’s motivation is clear, but his emotional state relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("internal deficit," "terror in his chest") rather than embodied behavior. The transition from misanthrope to someone desperate for connection is summarized rather than dramatized through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is stated clearly but relies on abstract diagnostic labels ("uncharted emotional depths," "gravitational center") rather than embodied desire. The protagonist's journey is one of endurance rather than agency; the resolution happens to her (a feeling washes over her) rather than resulting from a costly, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian is a clearly defined archetype with intelligible motivation, but he lacks genuine agency under pressure. His internal state ("imposter," "guessing") is stated but does not impede his god-like competence or force a difficult trade-off on the page. The conflict remains abstract, as he operates from a position of safety without facing active resistance or character-specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Emotions are delivered via abstract labels ("joyful sorrow," "poignant happiness") rather than embodied sensation. The protagonist's motivation is asserted through narration ("his motivation was to translate silence") rather than dramatized through conflict or desire.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and poignant, but her competence relies on stated labels like "analytically intuitive" rather than dramatized struggle. The connection to Kael provides strong emotional grounding, though the ease with which she interprets abstract clues lowers the sense of internal conflict or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving him to make a high-stakes choice with a clearly defined cost (sanity). His agency is active rather than passive, hijacking the experiment through competence. However, his interiority occasionally drifts into abstract pseudo-psychology ("psychiatric architecture of his own mind") rather than grounded, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a competent, proactive protagonist, but he lacks internal conflict or genuine vulnerability, reading more as an archetype than a flawed individual. Kael serves primarily as a foil to demonstrate Elias's skill, lacking depth beyond his role as the loud, clumsy antagonist. The dynamic is functional but relies on a stark competence gap rather than relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions as a benevolent archetype rather than a complex character, lacking internal friction or doubt. The young woman serves purely as a prop for his intervention, with no agency or distinct personality beyond generic distress. The interaction is one-sided, reducing the dynamic to a mechanical transaction of "soothing" rather than a human exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but he operates more as a plot vehicle than a deeply conflicted character. The "burdensome gift" is stated rather than dramatized as a personal cost within the scene; the children serve as props rather than distinct entities.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian and Vane possess clear, opposing motivations that drive a physicalized emotional conflict. However, Vane's internal pivot is accelerated by the "magic" of the scrimshaw rather than purely character-driven agency, diluting the earned nature of his submission.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's internal split—manifesting as a manic sports announcer to dissociate from grief—is a compelling, character-specific coping mechanism that dramatizes the conflict beautifully. However, the narrative occasionally relies on diagnostic summary ("inhabiting an emotional void he had practiced," "engaging in a survivalist erasure") rather than trusting the performance to convey the psychological state.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara functions primarily as a competent vehicle for the world-building rather than a conflicted agent; her motivation is declared ("aesthetically driven") rather than dramatized through hard choices. While her internal experience is vivid, the lack of significant error, flaw, or hesitation under the "lethal voltage" lowers the emotional stakes. The realization at the end feels like a guaranteed success of her training rather than a hard-won personal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is a distinct, well-realized protagonist whose disability is reframed as a thematic asset, driving her unique motivation. Her agency is evident in the negotiation tactics, though the "innocently cunning" trait is delivered via a narrative label rather than purely dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her pivotal shift is summarized in abstract terms ("decided to solve this failure by questioning assumptions") rather than dramatized through internal struggle. The prompt-mandated realization feels inserted rather than organic to her character's psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a competent functionary of the plot, and while his expertise is convincing, he faces no internal contradiction or active resistance that tests his character, leaving him somewhat static. The client serves as a passive vessel for his craft rather than a distinct agent, reducing the potential for relational friction or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's motivation to "map cultural patterns" is compelling and drives the action. However, the pivotal internal shift from observer to whistleblower is summarized ("deciding to confide") rather than fully dramatized in the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s characterization through the "chaotic dance" is excellent, grounding her discipline and determination in specific physical action rather than internal monologue. However, her reaction to the climax relies on summarized emotion ("anguished joy," "petty greed") rather than embodied experience, making the emotional peak feel abstract compared to the visceral journey.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s motivation is singular and compels the central action, creating a cohesive character arc defined by his role as a custodian. The internal cost is acknowledged ("victory was steep"), though the emotion is occasionally labeled ("felt a profound, luminous regret") rather than fully dramatized through physical interiority, which limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's internal state is conveyed through diagnostic summary ("needed to balance her demanding self-respect," "internal turmoil") rather than dramatized choice. The "sympathetic shedding" moment explains her psychology to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from the action. While the motivation is clear, the emotional arc feels tidily managed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's specific compulsion ("closure seeker who opens wounds") directly drives the central action and forces him to pay a visible physical price (tearing stitches). However, the characterization relies heavily on expository summary ("man defined by a terrible contradiction") rather than allowing the behavior to emerge solely through the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is distinct ("desperate need") and agency is clear, but the protagonist's high competence removes the friction necessary for higher bands. The "predator" trait is stated but not tested by genuine struggle or significant internal conflict; she executes the procedure without doubt or error.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian is clearly motivated and his burden is established early, but his characterization relies heavily on archetypal labels ("moonstruck dreamer," "profound sensitivity") rather than idiosyncratic detail. The pivotal transition from struggle to rest is precipitated by physical collapse ("knees buckled") rather than a fully agentic decision, weakening the internal arc's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen functions as a dedicated archetype defined by his role rather than a multifaceted character. His motivation is delivered via exposition ("simple but infinite") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or conflicting impulse. The "dreamless" trait feels like a premise condition rather than a cost paid viscerally in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elian’s motivation is clearly stated ("rediscover the wild frontier"), but it is not dramatized through difficult choices or trade-offs. The character functions as a capable solver of problems rather than a struggling protagonist; his internal conflict is resolved via magical intuition rather than a costly decision or earned growth.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    The characters function as allegorical archetypes (the Guide, the Mourner) rather than individuated people; their internal lives are stated via labels ("practiced empathy," "fragility") rather than demonstrated through idiosyncratic choice. The dialogue relies on therapy-speak ("The freedom often does") that explains feelings instead of embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s internal struggle is viscerally grounded in the physical "nerve regeneration" agony, making the abstract thematic conflict felt in the body. The shift from seeking safety to choosing resistance is earned through this physical endurance and the specific discovery of the bolt. His agency is active; he interprets the environment and redefines his role within it.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orel is a static archetype who executes a plan without internal conflict, doubt, or evolution. The antagonist is a stock figure of vanity, lacking nuance or competence to truly challenge the protagonist. While the physical contrast is effective, the emotional landscape is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clearly defined by a specific past trauma (coral bleaching) which grounds his obsession. The internal conflict regarding the "periodically eternal" concept adds depth, moving him beyond a mere functionary. However, the physical method of his obsession—tapping on the hull to "feel" deep-sea vibrations—feels slightly performative rather than physically grounded in the character's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is defined by labels ("barefoot stargazer") and exposition rather than dramatic choice. Her motivation is abstract ("find the pattern"), and she faces no internal resistance or contradiction; her success is earned by innate ability rather than a difficult decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a distinct, capable protagonist with a clear motivation ("evolve tradition") that drives the plot. However, she lacks internal conflict or contradiction; her certainty flattens the emotional texture of her sacrifice, making her feel more like a vehicle for the concept than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s internal landscape is compelling, with somatic details of trauma grounding the character effectively ("fire and red mist"). However, the use of diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers") during the peak crisis creates a clinical distance that slightly dampens the immediate emotional cost. The "quietly talented" characterization relies on summary rather than dramatization, but the choice to freeze and re-orient is well-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, well-conceived focalizer whose identity as a portrait artist meaningfully shapes his perception of the crisis (viewing the glitch as a failure of form). However, his interiority occasionally drifts into abstract intellectualization ("Is there any point...") rather than embodied reaction, distancing the reader from the visceral threat of the closing walls.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Silas is distinct, with albinism creating immediate physical stakes. However, the "consciously wild" trait clashes slightly with his immediate reliance on the drone without enough dramatized friction; the contradiction is explained away ("yet this hunt required") rather than felt. The "serene anger" reads as a labelled emotional state rather than a fully embodied complex feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and high-stakes, driving the narrative effectively. However, the internal conflict relies on explicit labeling ("feeling bravely conflicted," "sworn duty warred violently") rather than dramatized hesitation or micro-choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is resolved too neatly, shifting from violent instinct to pacifist resolve without struggle. The intruder functions as a prop rather than a character, losing all agency and collapsing simply because Elara sheathes a weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is a competent, focused professional whose expertise drives the plot, satisfying the "fisher" role. However, internal conflict is minimal; she resists external pressure (the lullaby) but lacks a contradictory internal impulse or dilemma to deepen the characterization beyond "cool-headed" efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor is a distinct, highly competent focalizer, but she lacks genuine internal conflict or vulnerability; her "desperate need" is stated but not dramatized in her cool, efficient dismantling of the antagonist. The absence of a character-specific flaw or a difficult choice with visible personal cost limits engagement and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s past as a tattooist is brilliantly integrated into the sci-fi mechanic, turning a technical solution into a character-specific act of redemption. While the backstory of her "negligence" is delivered via summary rather than dramatized reveal, the physicalization of her grief through the modified stylus creates strong, embodied emotion that grounds the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian's motivation is clear, but his characterization relies on adjectives ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") rather than embodied contradiction. He functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a complex protagonist; his internal state is described via labels ("specific, colorful anxiety") rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is dramatized through specific choices (cleaning faces, saving the child) rather than just interior monologue. The "gentle radical" descriptor in the opening is a slight "tell," but the subsequent actions and the pivotal decision to overwrite the metadata earn the characterization fully.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.0)
    Barnaby is a proactive protagonist, but his internal landscape is static; he begins and ends with the same motivation (applause/performance) without undergoing a shift in perspective or paying a personal price. Clara functions more as a prop for his intervention than a fully realized character, as her emotional pivot is externally actuated by magic rather than internal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to illuminate hidden pathways") is distinct and drives the beat. The "affectionate skeptic" trait is told, but immediately dramatized through his refusal to validate the "hive" while tending to its victim, creating a nuanced, actionable dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear objective. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak ("transitional object," "psychological bridge") to explain her state rather than trusting the dramatization of her attachment to the fossil. This intellectualization creates emotional distance during the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias acts as a functional vessel for the plot rather than a complex character. His motivation ("suspected the inscription was a mistranslation") appears as a convenient realization rather than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses. While competent, the lack of visceral interiority or personal cost keeps the characterization flat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a consistent, legible archetype with clear stakes, but his internal arc is summarized rather than dramatized in the moment. The "cowardice" backstory is told to the reader to set up the redemption, and the resolution feels pre-calculated rather than forged by a difficult on-page choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas functions as a plot device rather than a character, facing no internal resistance or meaningful choice beyond performing his assigned task. The passenger is a passive prop who is acted upon, lacking agency, voice, or a distinct reaction to the surgical removal of her memories.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    Silas functions more as an archetype (the zen master) than a character under pressure; his motivation is abstract and philosophical ("to understand") rather than visceral. He faces no difficult choices or internal contradictions, and the resolution comes without personal cost or sacrifice, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and the gardener/mechanic duality is compelling. However, interiority relies on summarized labels ("devotion," "wistfully pragmatic") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's internal journey relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("translate isolation into independence") rather than embodied emotion. The realization is processed through abstract summary ("The goal was not to forget... The goal was to coexist") rather than a messy, felt struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure; her motivation is abstract ("find the thread") and stated in exposition rather than shown through struggle. The internal realization at the end ("secret... no longer a burden") is an unearned epiphany not driven by a difficult on-page choice or cost. She faces no genuine dilemma, only a puzzle with an immediate, intuitive solution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias is a competent, proactive protagonist, but his characterization relies heavily on expository traits ("rogue celestial signal interpreter") rather than dramatized internal conflict. While he experiences physiological stress ("trembling hands"), he faces no agonizing choices or moral dilemmas; his path from problem to solution is linear and devoid of personal cost. The narrative asserts his cynical worldview but does not force him to question or sacrifice it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s specific trait ("prudently adventurous") effectively drives the pivotal decision to stay and play rather than flee, integrating character into plot mechanics. However, emotional interiority often relies on summarized labels ("wistful rebellion washed over her," "heart hammered") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas's detachment is compelling and distinct, grounding his artistic process in a unique psychological reality. However, Miller functions largely as a convenient prop for the climax; his rapid shift from skepticism to crumbled grief feels slightly unearned and performative given the brevity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear but relies on exposition ("fervently believed") rather than action under pressure to define the character. The "nervously confident" trait is told as a label rather than shown through contradictory behavior or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("Silas was dynamically observant," "His motivation had always been...") rather than dramatized behavior. While the protagonist functions as a vessel for the plot, the emotional arc is told through abstract summaries of guilt ("missed exits, broken strings") rather than embodied memory or specific, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    Silas is a distinct, competent protagonist, but his "unshakable stillness" renders him static, preventing the display of contradictory impulses or genuine vulnerability under pressure. He functions more as a thematic vessel than a character undergoing a crucible, making his final survival feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.9)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot without internal conflict, doubt, or distinct personality traits beyond her role. Her success feels inevitable due to pre-assigned attributes rather than character tactics under pressure, and her "consuming motivation" is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaelen is a competent focalizer who drives the action, fitting the "warlike serenity" brief well. However, he functions more as a vehicle for the plot than a character with internal friction; he faces the chaos with the "grace of a falling leaf" and succeeds without hesitation or personal cost. The lack of contradictory impulses or a moment where his competence is tested limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("anxious elation," "terror and ecstatic hope") rather than embodied reaction. Jaren's "purposefully curious" nature is stated directly rather than dramatized through unique investigative choices. Elara is a compelling visual presence, but their interaction remains transactional and lacks shifting status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s reckless idealism isn't just a label; it drives a high-stakes metaphysical trade where he sacrifices his own internal stability for his sister. The cost—loss of certainty—is specific, embodied, and paid on the page, validating his motivation beyond mere altruism.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is a distinct, well-rendered protagonist; his roadie-to-appraiser background creates specific, earned internal conflict ("impostor in a suit"). The shift in motivation from profit to stewardship is logical but feels slightly rushed and diagnostic in the final paragraph, reading more as a summary of change rather than a dramatized emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s internal logic is highly specific and consistent; the fusion of physicist and translator creates a unique worldview that drives the narrative. The emotional arc from grief to technical "translation" is embodied well in the action of planting the seed. The final state of "touching distance" feels earned by his specific method of processing loss.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian is a competent functionary whose motivation ("preserve wonder") is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through costly struggle. His internal conflict is theoretical, and he solves the central problem with established expertise rather than a character-defining choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation shifts abruptly via a told-only realization ("A sudden realization seized him") rather than dramatized pressure. The protagonist's unique talent is asserted as a label and only activates conveniently at the climax to force a resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer; his "unmedicated clarity" provides a consistent, albeit delusional, logic for his actions. The shift from manic interpretation of graffiti to the vulnerability of weeping feels earned and human. However, the label "truth-seeking river chronicler" in the opening feels slightly expository rather than demonstrated solely through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions competently as a vehicle for the premise, but her interiority relies on adjectival telling ("cautious exuberance," "fragile blend of terror") rather than embodied emotion. The "cost" of the first letter remains abstract backstory, which lowers the immediate felt stakes since her personal investment is stated rather than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian's internal conflict is grounded effectively in the "mulberry ache," a specific somatic marker that avoids generic emotional labeling. His professional identity as a researcher contrasts sharply with his treasonous intent, creating a complex dynamic where his expertise is subverted for rebellion. The motivation is palpable and drives a decisive, high-cost choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a highly competent tool for the plot rather than a character with internal agency or contradiction. Her success is achieved through professional skill without forcing a dilemma, sacrifice, or defining choice that would reveal character depth. The mentioned cost of pouring in her "own vitality" is expository and lacks dramatized consequence or physical toll on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is a coherent focalizer with a clear role, but her internal arc relies on asserted diagnostic realizations ("paralyzed by the same terror") rather than embodied struggle. The connection between the soul's fear and her own history is intellectually drawn but lacks visceral on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivations are clear and the dynamic is legible, but Vance's transformation from "monolith" to broken child is swift and relies heavily on the mirror prop rather than earned internal struggle. The breakdown feels slightly mechanical given the short runway.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's backwards-aging condition is compelling and creates inherent urgency ("too young to teach"), anchoring her motivation. Kael functions well as a foil, though his desperation feels slightly generic compared to Elara's specificity. The teacher-student dynamic effectively drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    Silas is a competent archetype whose mastery is convincing, though the "weathered resolve" description relies on clichéd phrasing rather than embodied action. The "youthful desperation" flashback provides a necessary emotional anchor, successfully deepening the character beyond a mere functionary of the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her rejection of the automated world is substantiated by the physical cost of the climb. However, her internal arc is somewhat linear; she moves from determination to success without a moment of significant internal doubt or contradictory impulse that would deepen the psychological realism. The "underachieving mage" identity feels slightly archetypal rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's central trait is delivered via diagnostic labeling ("a statement that allowed him to hide behind truth") rather than dramatized behavior. While the motivation is clear, the emotional resolution feels tidy and immediate, lacking the messy, embodied contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Hiero’s determination is legible, and the coin-casting ritual provides a solid objective correlative for his role. However, internal states are often summarized through abstract labeling ("quietly enthusiastic," "profound, nagging suspicion") rather than embodied in the moment, which distances the reader from the visceral cost of the doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's identity as a reaper feels largely ornamental, as he functions more like a mage; a human archivist could perform the same actions with minor edits. Grief is often asserted via abstract nouns ("hollowness," "void") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or specific, embodied behavior under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elian is defined by narrator labels ("earnestly naive," "lukewarm") and competence rather than complex choice; his success feels inevitable and he remains static, unaffected by the "crushing" stakes mentioned.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias acts as a competent functional vehicle for the story's theme rather than a conflicted individual. His motivation is stated ("to spin stories into shared meaning") rather than emerging from a struggle between competing values. The lack of internal friction or doubt regarding his manipulation of history makes his "humane" certainty feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara functions as a coherent protagonist with a clear goal, but her internal conflict relies on stock dichotomies (logic vs. intuition) and token backstory (the sister's ribbon) rather than deep characterization. The resolution of her internal arc—simply deciding to "open herself"—lacks the friction and psychological cost required for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s internal conflict—managing panic to maintain Lyra’s confidence—is dramatized with precision. The specific physical choice to block her view with his shoulders effectively grounds the abstract "watcher's burden" in a concrete action. His competence is high, but the "shaking hands" provide a necessary vulnerability that humanizes the archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kael’s motivation to overcome numbness is clear, but his internal state is described through sci-fi shorthand ("data points," "ghost in a synthetic shell") rather than unique embodiment. The dialogue postures with abstract philosophical statements ("I am what remains") that feel performative rather than revealing character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent, but functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a character under pressure. Motivation is stated rather than tested; he faces no genuine internal resistance or flaw that complicates the "orthogonal" success.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas is a compelling, obsessive figure whose internal conflict (peace vs. violence/noise) is vividly dramatized through the leaf blower ritual. The paradox of being a "musician" of industrial decay is executed well, though the interiority occasionally leans into melodramatic labeling ("tragic paradox").

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct and compelling, grounding the eldritch concept in a relatable emotional struggle of homesickness and loneliness. The shift from predator to observer is motivated by the intruder's fear, though the "newfound motivation" in paragraph four relies slightly on summary explanation rather than fully dramatized pressure. The internal contradiction between the guardian's nature and its desire for "uncertainty" creates a strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian has a clear objective and a defined philosophical stance, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless alchemist") rather than embodied emotion. The internal conflict is stated in summary rather than dramatized through hesitation or contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara displays distinct professional competence and a specific worldview ("recipe for a star nursery"), grounding the fantasy in tangible work. However, the pivotal moment of "unlearning academy training" arrives as a sudden internal realization rather than a struggle forced by escalating failure, making the victory feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by the prompt trait ("resiliently positive") which appears as a label rather than an embodied behavior under pressure. She lacks internal conflict or doubt, acting as a functional plot device with no contradictory impulses to make her human.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a compelling protagonist whose specific vocation ("fever dream architect") drives the narrative logic. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through the weaving process, and the renunciation of the woman’s memory to stabilize the structure adds necessary emotional cost to his technical goal.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Harlin’s internal motivation (“singular and deeply private”) is compelling and drives the narrative arc effectively. The duality of the veteran instructor and the dreamer is well-balanced, though the specific phrasing of his trait ("balancedly curious") relies on diagnostic telling rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara is a competent focalizer with a clear shift from curiosity to protection, though the transition ("motivation clarified instantly") feels mechanical. Her internal state is often described via abstract labels ("penchant for questions") rather than embodied struggle, limiting emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a competent protagonist whose phobia adds necessary texture to the setting, effectively "weaponizing the dense silence." However, his motivation ("solemn vow") feels somewhat generic and stated rather than deeply embodied, reading more like a role-playing archetype than a complex psychological drive. The internal conflict is functional but resolved through sheer competence rather than a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a compelling internal state ("bureaucratic anomaly"), but the climax relies on summarized internal processing ("realizing that the failure...") rather than embodied reaction. The heartbeat counting is a strong grounding trait, but the emotional epiphany feels slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sylas is a distinct, biologically integrated protagonist whose motivation drives the plot directly to a high-cost sacrifice. The choice to trade his voice for the preservation of texture is earned by the setup, though the internal conflict is resolved quickly in action rather than debated. The physical consequence is visceral and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct protagonist with a compelling, unconventional motivation (turning spite into a joke). However, the narrative relies on expository summary ("In truth, he was...") to establish his depth rather than revealing it purely through friction or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara acts with agency, and her motivation is clear, though the "treasonous" intent is stated rather than dramatized through initial hesitation or risk assessment. The internal experience is somewhat generic; the "gap between knowing and understanding" is an interesting beat, but her emotional landscape lacks contradictory impulses or specific, embodied fear despite the high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct presence, and the "mocking bow" effectively dramatizes his "respectfully rebellious" trait. However, the final paragraph relies on diagnostic summary ("driven to find where broken promises heal") to explain his motivation rather than embodying it in action, which distances the reader from the character's internal reality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a distinct, internalized protagonist whose philosophy of silence is not merely a trait but the central conflict. The transition from silence to song is a dramatized choice with a felt conceptual cost—abandoning his identity to save his art. The characterization holds up under pressure, though the "quietly persistent" description is a slight "tell" rather than a "show."

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with a compelling, specific worldview ("metaphors were a form of physics") and clear motivation. However, the climax relies on material failure (the scarf snapping) rather than a high-stakes decision or renunciation, limiting the demonstration of agency under pressure. Her return to the desk validates her sanity (Earned Stasis) but feels like a default reset rather than a transformed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("complex emotional code," "hollow ache") rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. Her motivation is clear but the resolution comes through competence without a character-defining choice or sacrifice. The emotional arc is linear—distress to relief—lacking the friction of competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    Silas is a functional archetype (the mystical technician) rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. The woman serves as a passive vessel for the problem, resolving her struggle simply by obeying an instruction ("Do not look down"), which misses the opportunity for a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Silas is clearly motivated by a singular lack, but his characterization relies heavily on summary exposition ("chronically curious mind," "hands-on folklorist") rather than dramatized traits in the present moment. He lacks internal conflict or a contradictory impulse during the scene; his actions are linear and unopposed reactions to external events.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas is a compelling focalizer with a distinct worldview, effectively driving the scene through the contradiction between his gruff exterior and internal "combative tenderness." The habit of walking backwards is well-integrated into the staging of the tension. However, the narrative explicitly states his motivation ("His motivation was to mentor resilience quietly") rather than letting it emerge solely through action, which slightly flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elian functions as an archetype rather than a complex character; his "insatiable creativity" is stated but does not generate internal friction against his duty of "disciplined subtraction." He faces no difficult choice, executing his task with perfect competence and no hesitation. The emotional landscape is described through labels ("desperate motivation," "burden") rather than dramatized through behavior or conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elian's motivation is distinctly layered: professional duty ("ground restless spirits") conflicts with personal grief ("his brother"), creating rich interior pressure. The metaphor of guilt as "adhesive" and silence as "filler" perfectly bridges his internal state with his external action, leading to a closure where the cost—his permanent unrest—is viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on expository labels ("methodically curious," "shielded openness") rather than dramatized internal conflict. While the protagonist's skill set is clear, the emotional climax—channeling grief to operate a mechanism—reads as a functional tool use rather than a deeply felt, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a competent, distinct focalizer with a clear motivation ("physics of letting go"), but he operates as a detached observer rather than a protagonist under pressure. He faces no personal risk, difficult trade-off, or internal struggle, resulting in a static arc where he performs a procedural task without paying a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian is a functional archetype (the tech-mage balladeer), but his internal landscape is static. Motivation is stated via exposition ("intended to purge that buffer") rather than dramatized through conflicting drives or hesitation. The resolution relies on diagnostic summary ("unspoken needs were finally heard and validated") rather than embodied emotion, flattening the character's journey into a procedural task.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elian functions as a competent observer rather than a protagonist under pressure; his motivation ("seek out joy") is abstract and stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "affectionate detachment" shields him from emotional cost, leaving him static; he enters and exits the scene with his worldview confirmed rather than challenged or deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elian is a consistent focalizer with a clear desire, but his internal landscape remains static. He observes rather than struggles; the emotional cost of his isolation is stated ("desperate") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is compelling and his internal experience of prosopagnosia is rendered with specific, sensory interiority ("topography of ridges"). The connection between his condition and his artistic philosophy drives the narrative, though the epiphany feels slightly more functional than emotionally raw.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is a competent functionary who faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. Her "diligent curiosity" is stated and acted upon, but she meets no resistance that tests her values or forces a sacrifice. The "sociable isolation" is a label rather than a dramatic pressure; she succeeds without emotional cost or character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is a competent, professional protagonist who drives the action, but her interiority feels functional rather than deeply embodied. While the mirror scene hints at insecurity ("potential failures"), she resolves the conflict by simply closing her eyes, a choice that bypasses rather than explores her internal contradictions or the weight of her title.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.7)
    Characterization relies on stock archetypes (the cynical mechanic, the stoic leader) and asserts relationships via summary rather than dramatizing them through friction. The "family" dynamic is a declared state rather than a felt reality tested by the crisis, and individual agency is subsumed by collective agreement without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Silas functions as an archetype (the lonely custodian) rather than a fully realized character; he faces no internal conflict or difficult micro-choices on the page. His motivation is abstractly stated ("esoteric and deeply personal") rather than grounded in specific, dramatized memory or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    Silas's reluctance is stated ("despised the immense effort") but not dramatized through meaningful hesitation; he acts immediately and competently, reducing the internal conflict. The "metal infection" constraint is bypassed easily by his telekinetic ability, turning a potential physical cost into a functional mechanic without emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated, but his interiority often relies on summary and labeling ("uniquely symphonically minded," "deep, burning motivation") rather than embodied struggle. The connection between his grief and the scientific breakthrough is poignant, but the emotional logic feels somewhat told via these labels rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s motivation is compelling, shifting from apparent service to predatory curiosity at the closure. However, without a counter-force or character interaction until the final line, his internal contradictions are stated rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions as a competent professional archetype rather than a fully realized character. The text relies on comparative assertion ("Most would have recoiled... but Elara’s resolve was absolute") and expository summary ("Her motivation was to...") rather than dramatizing her internal struggle or specific personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is a competent functionary who solves the problem with established skills, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The "empathetically decisive" trait is told rather than dramatized through difficult choices, resulting in a flat character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly defined, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, technical metaphors ("recursive geometry," "helix-minded") rather than embodied emotion until the climax. While she functions effectively as a vehicle for the concept, the "helix" trait feels more like an assigned label than a lived, psychological perspective that drives specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is competent and the "prism-mind" trait effectively drives the tactical solution, but she lacks internal conflict or distinct emotional contradiction under pressure. The backstory of her novitiate hints at growth, yet the current challenge is met with "calculated grace" rather than genuine struggle or character-specific trade-offs. Motivation is clear but purely external; the victory feels inevitable rather than earned through vulnerability or a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s obsession is palpable and drives every micro-choice, anchoring the high-concept premise in visceral need. The emotional release at the closure feels earned by the prior "intensely quiet despair," though the explicit labeling of his perception ("symphonically minded") momentarily distances the reader from his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's internal arc from anxiety to acceptance is well-charted through the chess metaphor, and the "sacrificed piece" epiphany provides a strong, character-specific resolution. The transition feels earned, though the motivation is stated rather explicitly upfront.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear philosophical worldview ("eclectic pacifist") that drives his method. However, his characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling rather than dramatized struggle; he begins capable and ends satisfied without undergoing internal contradiction or paying a personal price for his empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("olfactorily sensitive to a degree," "metaphysical window") rather than demonstrated behavior. Motivation is explicitly told ("Her true motivation... was to cultivate serenity") rather than emerging from a struggle with high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is defined almost exclusively by her competence and role, lacking internal contradiction or distinct personality traits beyond "intrepid." Her success requires no character-specific growth or difficult moral choice, resulting in a functional but flat protagonist who overcomes obstacles without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara functions as a competent professional archetype, but the narrative lacks a crucible of internal contradiction or a difficult micro-choice to deepen her beyond her role. Her emotional experience is observed rather than embodied under pressure, keeping the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elian functions as a purely instrumental character, performing a duty without internal conflict, doubt, or deviation. His motivation is delivered via abstract thematic narration ("certify wonder as essential") rather than embodied drive, and he faces no difficult choices or personal costs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, but the character's emotional reactions rely on somatic clichés ("trembling fingers," "tears streamed," "weathered face") rather than specific, embodied distinctness. The internal shift is legible, yet the epiphany feels summarized rather than experienced through a difficult, active choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Operator's motivation is clear but delivered largely through exposition ("motivation was singular") rather than emergent action. Kael functions as a passive prop with no agency, limiting the scene's interpersonal depth. The "borrowing personalities" trait is intriguing but feels performed as a list of postures rather than a deep character engine.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's "jittery" trait is cleverly integrated as the mechanism for the climax, transforming a flaw into a tool. However, internal conflict is minimal; the anxiety is described but never forces a difficult trade-off or jeopardizes the mission before the solution is applied.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias is motivated and consistent, though his "paradox" nature is established via label ("man of paradoxes") rather than contradictory action under pressure. Mara’s emotional pivot is rapid; her skepticism melts instantly upon the magical display, reducing the potential for a deeper relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions more as an archetypal figure than a complex character; descriptors like "wistful" and "burdened by nostalgia" rely on summary labels rather than dramatized internal conflict. While her motivation is clear, she lacks contradictory impulses; her sacrifice feels inevitable from the start rather than a hard-won choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.6)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("motivation was singular") rather than dramatized through struggle; the shift from "meek" to resolved happens instantly in summary. Ewan's convenient possession of the "Magician's silk" contradicts his established identity as a simple blacksmith without explanation, creating a significant coherence gap.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is singular and drives the narrative arc effectively from the opening ritual to the specific revelation. While interiority is rich, it relies heavily on sensory adjectives ("velvet texture," "metallic taste") to signal emotion rather than varied, embodied reactions until the final physical cost anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer with a distinct worldview, but his motivation ("to bottle the feeling of safety") is delivered via exposition rather than emerging from struggle. The relationship dynamic remains static, as Thomas serves primarily as a prop for Elias's competence rather than an active participant in a two-way exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas functions more as an archetype (the mad prophet) than a complex character; his "shadowed elation" is static and lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required for depth. While his physical mannerisms are distinct ("jerky, rhythmic grace"), his agency is low-stakes—he performs a routine without facing a genuine dilemma or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian is a compelling focalizer, grounded by his occupational history ("blood of beetles") and the visceral internal conflict of the "wild animal" donor heart. The shift from fearing the heart's chaos to understanding its "geometry" provides a strong, character-specific internal arc. The motivation is abstract but anchored in the physical experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias acts as a competent functionary rather than a character under pressure; his motivation (curiosity about the trees) is stated in exposition but never tested by a difficult choice or sacrifice. The absence of internal conflict or contradictory impulses leaves him flat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation is fierce and drives the scene, with a tangible physical cost paid at the climax. However, her "scattered" cognitive state is mostly asserted through narration rather than dramatized through perception or decision-making struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elian is a functional archetype whose interiority relies on stated labels ("compassionate recluse," "burdensome attribute") rather than contradictory desires in the moment. The "weakness as strength" realization feels externally validated by the Librarian rather than earned through a costly, agonizing choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is consistent and his internal conflict (guilt vs. survival) is clear, but he relies heavily on expository labels ("chronicler of the slow fade," "creeping normality noticer") rather than dramatized traits. The emotion is often stated ("guilt that plagued him") rather than shown purely through action until the final ritual. The "heuristically gentle" trait feels like an inserted prompt constraint that disrupts the character's voice. His motivation is clear, but the execution leans on telling.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s prioritization of "mathematical proof" over "subjective" vision is a strong, defining trait that elevates her beyond a generic archivist. However, her motivation is stated directly ("Her primary motivation was...") using the prompt phrase rather than emerging solely through action, which distances the reader slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is competent, but her competence is often established through exposition ("She knew his plan was...") rather than subtext or action, which lowers tension. Kael reads as a stock villain with cliché descriptors ("grin like a jagged reef") and lacks dimension beyond his role as an obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s skepticism creates a strong internal filter, and her motivation to de-mystify the weather drives the plot effectively. However, the climax leans slightly passive; she observes the realization and is "elected" by the system rather than making an active, costly choice between competing values in the final beat. The transition from observer to participant is impactful but happens *to* her.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    Silas's motivation is clear but delivered largely through summary and abstract labels ("neurological curse," "spiritual imperative") rather than dramatized behavior. While the internal conflict is stated, the emotional landscape feels performative—a collection of "mournful" and "bruising" adjectives—rather than a specific, embodied psychological state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is physically embodied, transforming a search for records into a visceral struggle for survival. The shift from beautifier to whistleblower is earned through the somatic mechanic, though the trait's introduction is handled with slightly clunky exposition rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is a distinct, functional protagonist with a clear, singular goal ("preserve the color of wonder"). However, the narrative lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her seasonal muteness is a physical constraint rather than a source of psychological friction or choice-making duality. She executes a plan without hesitation or moral trade-off, resulting in a somewhat flat character arc despite the vivid external action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seven’s internal conflict—survival versus the "murder" of memory—is deeply felt and anchored in the specific "organic" physiology of his chassis. The decision to incinerate the past is a credible, high-cost resolution to his existential crisis, executed with character-specific logic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; her "terrifying composure" and lack of internal struggle render her static. Her motivation is an abstract thematic statement ("prove that listening heals") rather than a visceral drive, and she solves the crisis without confronting a flaw or paying a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the concept rather than a conflicted character; her "trembling fear" is mentioned but immediately "encrypted" into strength, bypassing genuine struggle. She faces no difficult binary choices or internal contradictions, resulting in a linear "competence porn" arc where success feels inevitable. The connection to her father attempts to add depth but is delivered via exposition ("She remembered the pain") rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias is a compelling contradiction: a fearful man displaying "practiced grace," voluntarily excising memories only to risk death to reclaim them. This internal conflict drives the external action, and his "grotesque archaeology" transforms a simple retrieval mission into a profound reclamation of self. The choice to dig carries visible physical risk and clear emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elian functions as a procedural tool rather than a character; the text explicitly removes his "human ego," leaving no room for internal conflict or contradictory impulses. He executes the ritual without hesitation, fear, or personal cost, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas's motivation shifts organically from academic curiosity to existential survival, grounding the fantasy elements in a relatable desperation. The dynamic between the two is sharp, with the "cliché" backstory acknowledged and then subverted by the tension of the interrogation. His final decision to accept the burden of the lie feels earned, closing his arc with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration of his role from student to conspirator.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but delivered through expository summary ("Her motivation was sharp and crystalline") rather than emerging solely from the pressure of the moment. The "charmed skeptic" trait is stated but her actions read as purely competent and resolved, lacking the dramatized hesitation the label suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian is highly competent and his motivation—redemption for past cowardice—is clear, but his internal arc is static within the scene. He enters resolved and succeeds without a moment of genuine doubt or psychological struggle that forces a new choice. The backstory provides context but does not actively complicate the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined by competence and role rather than specific internal conflict; she functions primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's magic system. Her motivation is stated in exposition ("burned with a cold intensity") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a competent procedural expert rather than a character under pressure; her motivation is explicitly stated ("singular and unyielding") rather than dramatized through conflict. She faces no internal contradictions or difficult tradeoffs; the "danger" of her art is asserted but never manifests as a personal cost or near-failure on the page. The result is a flat trajectory where competence solves the problem without emotional expense.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian is consistent but static; his motivation is purely cerebral, lacking the internal contradiction or emotional friction required for higher bands. The &quot;net-mender&quot; persona feels more like a thematic vehicle than a lived experience, with interiority relying on abstract philosophical summaries (e.g., &quot;binding twine to logic&quot;) rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly defined as a rationalist, but his pivot to "trusting his gut" to resolve the technical climax undermines this established trait without sufficient on-page grounding. While the final decision to publish demonstrates strong agency and aligns with his motivation, the mechanical resolution ("intuiting" the repair) feels like a convenient character patch rather than an earned evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is a clearly defined archetype with a legible internal conflict (visionary vs. obsolescence), and his motivation is explicit. However, the characterization relies heavily on summary and backstory ("Silas had groomed," "acted as") rather than dramatized interaction or micro-choices in the present moment. The emotional arc works conceptually but lacks the visceral, on-page texture of a fully inhabited scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian is a coherent archetypal figure, but he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His devotion to the task is singular and unhesitating; he sacrifices his "wealth" (the jars) without a moment of doubt or calculated loss, which flattens the emotional cost. The motivation is stated abstractly ("translator between generations") rather than dramatized through specific, personal stakes or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's motivation and actions are clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("He was a man who was logically emotional," "categorized the fear"). This intellectualizes the crisis rather than fully embodying the struggle, distancing the reader from the visceral panic. The shift from mechanical to biological problem-solving is a strong character beat, but the internal monologue feels more like a manual than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is a static expert whose motivation is delivered via exposition ("Her motivation was complex") rather than dramatized through struggle or choice. Kael acts purely as a functional foil for impatience, lacking dimension or agency. The absence of internal conflict or a moment of doubt makes the protagonist feel like a device rather than a character.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is sharply defined and the internal conflict between empathy and professional detachment is well-dramatized. Elias's decision to sacrifice his career advancement for the truth is a credible result of the pressure applied by the vision. The "fortified vulnerability" concept, while slightly expository, effectively frames his capacity to endure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt is a compelling engine that drives the scene, and his internal contradiction is well-established. However, the somatic descriptions of his emotion rely on clichés ("stone in his gut," "burning in his chest"), and the final realization is narrated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit Seven is compellingly drawn, blending mechanical function with a specific "spiritual ache" that drives agency. The internal conflict between survival protocols and the "yearning algorithm" is dramatized through the physical cost of stripping armor for speed. The character's unique perception (kaleidoscopic vision) deeply informs his worldview and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "brightly attentive" mask Silas adopts for the drone is a brilliant, specific character detail that dramatizes his survival instinct under corporate pressure. His obsession is clearly drawn and enacted, though the "knuckles turned white" reaction at the closure is a slightly stock physical cue.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kaelen functions as a flawless vehicle for the plot rather than a conflicted protagonist; his "shadows" are aesthetic rather than psychological obstacles. He encounters no genuine internal resistance, and his "calm intuition" removes the possibility of error or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is distinct and the "trembling scenery" perception effectively dramatizes his detachment. However, the pivotal internal shift ("terror had vanished overnight") relies on summary description rather than on-page struggle, and some interiority leans into diagnostic labeling ("hollow, resonant curiosity").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    Character motivation relies on abstract diagnostic labeling ("nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than embodied desire. The interaction lacks genuine friction or subtext; the woman functions as a passive receptacle for Elias's wisdom rather than a complex agent. Internal states are summarized ("tormented by a perspective") rather than shown through specific thought or action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian's motivation is established, but his agency is undercut at the emotional peak when "magical duress" forces the confession rather than him choosing vulnerability against resistance. The interiority is brief but functional, anchoring the high-concept setting in a recognizable human fear.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elian is a functional archetype rather than a character under pressure; he lacks internal conflict, distinct flaws, or a moment of doubt. His competence is absolute, turning the narrative into a procedural execution of a ritual without meaningful personal stakes or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is legible, but the "reticent" trait dissolves too easily without enough visceral struggle or contradiction during the act of speaking. The "fear" is shed without a visible price or trade-off on the page, making the character's internal victory feel convenient rather than deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's unique cognitive constraint (precognitive forgetfulness) creates genuine, embodied struggle that drives the scene's central action. The motivation, while abstract, is consistent with the archetype and compels him to act under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian's expertise drives the narrative; his decision to align with the mechanism rather than force it creates a distinct, character-specific solution to the crisis. The internal grief serves as a credible engine for his obsession with the ephemeral, ensuring his technical actions carry heavy emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias acts as a flawless functionary rather than a character with internal contradictions; his expertise solves the central problem without visible struggle or personal cost. The trait "decisively kind" is told and then demonstrated, but his hyper-competence prevents the "blind spots" or doubt required for deeper characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, and her reaction to the climax—resignation rather than horror—fits the established tone. However, the robotic repetition of the attribute "quietly deliberate" creates a mechanical distance that flattens her interiority. The character feels more like a functional vessel for the prompt's requirements than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aris’s internal conflict between medical rigor and compassionate myth-making is compelling, creating a distinct "forgiving skeptic" persona. The mirroring of "shrewd innocence" between the creature and the mother feels slightly forced, but his decision to weaponize hope is a strong, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is defined clearly by her trauma and craft, but her internal conflict resolves too smoothly via a deep breath ("inhaled the moist... air"), lacking visible cost. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult choice or sacrifice in the present moment. The "star watcher" aspect is largely expositional, disconnected from the immediate physical stakes of the polishing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias is consistent but defined more by the prompt's labels ("watchful dreamer," "quietly proactive") than by organic friction or contradiction. His internal landscape is serene and summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices; he acts as a vehicle for the theme rather than a living consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but interiority relies on stock labels ("conflicted novelist," "crushing weight") rather than specific, embodied contradiction. The character's struggle is stated as a summary ("paradox") rather than dramatized through hesitation or a costly choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elian is defined by labels ("whimsical tinkerer") and accessories rather than specific interiority or contradictory impulses. He faces no genuine dilemma or emotional cost beyond generic exhaustion, resulting in a flat character arc that lacks the friction required for literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Silas is a competent, embodied protagonist with a clear motivation ("translate heartbeats into maps"). However, he lacks internal conflict or a distinct flaw that complicates the ritual; his success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a consistent, stoic focalizer whose internal logic drives the narrative. His motivation is clear and high-stakes, though the "reflective locksmith" persona feels slightly expository rather than fully lived-in. The moment of "looking away" to capture the target is a strong behavioral detail that grounds his expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation ("collect the weights") is clear and functionally drives the scene, but her interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("transparent cage") rather than raw, contradictory impulse. The "crushing" burden is stated more than dramatized through personal stakes beyond professional duty.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("structural integrity of grief") rather than embodied emotion. The motivation is explicitly stated ("harvest lessons") rather than emerging from a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jaren’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the scene effectively. Interiority is vivid, though the "chronologically confused" trait feels more like a labeled state than a constraint that forces a difficult choice in the moment. The interaction with the ghost reveals deep character flaws (hubris), earning the emotional weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("functionally creative") and essayistic summaries of worldview rather than embodied habits or struggle. Elias faces no internal conflict and pays no personal cost for his success; his competence is assumed rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s internal conflict is well-defined, and the movement from repression to a moment of chaotic communion is compelling. However, the backstory regarding his past as a luthier is delivered via summary ("Decades ago...") rather than being dramatized or integrated more seamlessly into the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the closure choice effectively, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("specific weight," "emotional weight") rather than embodied sensation. The character reads consistent but slightly theoretical, filtered through the theme rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as a "philosophical seed collector," but his "desperate need" is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle or cost. He functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a character forced to make a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator functions more as a thematic device than a fully realized character; his &quot;difficulty&quot; in the process is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle or error. The Countess is a well-sketched recipient of the narrator's expertise, but her internal turn relies heavily on the narrator's successful intervention rather than her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Valerius is a compelling focalizer whose obsession is embodied in specific action (grease-stained velvet, feverish assembly). His motivation to resurrect beauty drives every beat, and the internal conflict between scientific rigor and desperate hope is well-rendered. The emotional cost at the end is visceral, though the final paragraph drifts slightly into diagnostic labeling of his feelings ("joy curdled," "mixture of triumph and profound sorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara’s motivation is delivered through abstract labels ("lived by a core concept of unyielding compassion") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or embodied struggle. The character reads more as a vessel for the prompt’s themes than a distinct individual under pressure; her internal state is summarized in expository blocks rather than revealed through friction with the task.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s "mechanic" worldview consistently colors the narrative voice, effectively grounding the fantasy elements. However, her internal struggle is minimal; the shift from friction/leverage to "sidereal patience" feels like a convenient plot bridge rather than a character-driven choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict and the final realization of his own obsolescence provide a strong, earned emotional arc. However, the opening relies on diagnostic labeling ("otherworldly sentimentalist") to establish traits rather than revealing them through immediate interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is drawn with specific, embodied interiority, and his motivation to capture "collective grief" drives the narrative logic. The relationship with the grandfather provides a necessary pressure cooker for the epiphany, moving beyond a standard ghost trope into a functional mentorship. The shift from seeking geometry to accepting the "tangled knot" is a distinct, character-driven change in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas is a well-defined archetype whose internal duality (sinner/priest) drives the narrative efficiently. The concept of carving sins into a tool provides excellent physical grounding for his internal state. However, the characterization relies heavily on summary (e.g., "ethically diligent," "obsessed with temporal purity") rather than dramatized behavior prior to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    Silas is consistent but static; his "blithe" nature insulates him from the stakes rather than engaging with them. Motivation is stated ("to discover the shape of intentions") but lacks visceral cost or internal contradiction; he acts as a competent functionary without emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation—the "cruel kindness" of forcing innovation—is compelling and distinct. However, his internal struggle remains largely cerebral; the physical embodiment of his stress ("trembling of his heart") feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of his intellectual burden.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian serves as a competent archetypal "rebel scribe" but lacks internal contradiction or surprising specificities beyond his function. The emotional state is conveyed through labeled abstractions ("thistled calm," "psychic weight") rather than embodied reaction, and his choice to cloak the light is a standard survival reflex that doesn't deepen his character profile.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas is a compelling, archetypal protagonist whose role and internal philosophy drive the narrative effectively. His "gentle attribute" of manipulation for the client's good adds complexity, though his motivation is stated explicitly rather than purely dramatized. The dynamic with Elara provides a solid emotional anchor for his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose worldview permeates the narrative voice. However, his "logic vs. emotion" trait leans into caricature (e.g., treating emotion as an uncalculable variable), which feels slightly stock rather than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian is consistent but defined largely by abstract labels ("paradox of purpose," "traveled stillness") rather than dramatized internal struggle. While his motivation is clear, his emotional arc is summarized by the narrator—we are told he is "expectantly resigned" rather than feeling the weight of that resignation through subtext or specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a competent, distinct focalizer with a clear worldview ("laws were a lot like tough meat"). However, he lacks genuine internal conflict or vulnerability; his expertise makes the process feel low-risk, and he functions more as a technical operator than a character undergoing a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is a distinct focalizer, but Kael's rapid pivot from frantic desperation to aesthetic acceptance in the final beat feels unearned and convenient. The "involuntary truth" trait occasionally forces dialogue that sounds more like authorial exposition ("I must perform a reveal") than organic character compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias is a distinct, purposeful protagonist with a specific obsession that drives the narrative. However, the internal landscape feels somewhat cerebral; his motivation is stated ("gnawing motivation") rather than dramatized through high-stakes struggle or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's internal shift from accuser to savior is clear and earned, though the "pearl" metaphor reads as slightly standard. Caelum's motivation is delivered via explicit exposition ("This was the core of his motivation") rather than dramatized friction, flattening the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian is a distinct, capable protagonist whose "grim optimist" persona anchors the surreal setting. His motivation is clear, though the backstory of the "woman in the doorway" feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of his mathematical solution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian functions as a romantic archetype (tortured artist) rather than a complex character. His motivation is clear, but his internal state lacks friction; he moves from determination to success without significant doubt or contradictory impulses. The emotion feels performed ("grace of a ghost") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elian's transition from a steward of physical artifacts to a baker of symbols demonstrates high-agency adaptation under pressure. His internal motivation to "rescue dying arts" drives a credible pivot when the primary path (sealing the canisters) is blocked.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle. Elias is hyper-competent and devoid of hesitation, resulting in a static character arc where he faces no significant doubts or trade-offs. The emotional landscape is somewhat flat, focused entirely on technical anticipation rather than the advertised "bleak exhilaration."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a compelling, paradoxical internal conflict (hatred of the life he fought to regain). The shift from physical terror ("trembling hands") to the necessary apathy required for the climax is sharp but motivated by his specific plan. The emotional logic of "tricking fear" with vulnerability is executed well.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a conflicted individual; her mastery is absolute, and she faces no internal doubt or contradictory impulse. The narrative states her motivation and philosophy explicitly ("Her driving motivation was to turn...") rather than dramatizing a struggle between competing values or fears.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara is a highly competent protagonist whose expertise drives the discovery, satisfying the 9+ requirement for agency under pressure. Her internal shift from observer to "offering" provides a powerful Conceptual Repricing of her identity. The brother’s loss serves as a functional, if standard, anchor for her risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    Character interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("clinical precision," "processed that fear as a variable") rather than embodied emotion. The antagonist's sudden capitulation to a metaphor undermines his established motivation and reduces the scene's psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the central action effectively. The protagonist's "stoically sensitive" nature is stated rather than purely dramatized, and the interiority occasionally drifts into romanticized abstraction ("soul that vibrated"), but the commitment to the task is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian is a functional, competent protagonist whose &quot;logical&quot; nature consistently drives his methodology. However, his interiority feels somewhat mechanical; he processes the life-shattering revelation of the penal colony with instant, robotic rationalization ("organizing the terrifying reality"), reducing the emotional resonance of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s interiority is tightly bound to his craft, transforming a metaphysical crisis into tangible labor. The decision to wound himself to bind the dream serves as a definitive, character-specific choice under pressure, earning the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a fiercely realized protagonist; the specific backstory ("burning lace," "ionized soil") anchors his obsession in visceral reality. The final micro-choice to sabotage the system creates a powerful, high-cost closure that confirms his descent from survivor to addict of the "unhappened."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation relies on diagnostic label-speak ("sentence with the vowels removed," "phantom pain") rather than embodied struggle. The resolution is unearned; she does not change through a difficult choice, but rather receives a technological fix that instantly resolves her existential crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist’s profession is distinct and compelling, providing a strong foundation for the narrative. However, emotional states are often reported via diagnostic labeling ("guilt," "twisted in the agony," "tempered regret") rather than dramatized through behavior. The internal conflict is clear but resolved somewhat intellectually.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is a functional protagonist with a clear motivation, but his internal landscape feels static; his "flaw" (carrying the drawer pull) acts purely as a superpower rather than a source of genuine struggle or contradiction in the scene. The characterization leans on "telling" via the narrator ("uncommonly thoughtful") rather than revealing traits through costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between the "grand navigator" ego and the "survivor" reality is compelling and well-dramatized. The physical manifestations of his trauma (shaking hand, recoil) ground the emotion, though the epiphany relies slightly on diagnostic interiority ("expectations collapse," "align heart and action") rather than purely subtextual realization.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's desperate motivation to reclaim empathy drives the narrative effectively, creating a tightly focus internal arc. The transition from apathy to "hot and jagged" regret is earned through the externalization of the victim's timeline, grounding the emotional shift in specific narrative stimuli. The character's internal state is rendered with precise, embodied detail, such as his "dry, clinical appreciation" of the wondrous setting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the central action with clear stakes. While his reluctance to transform is stated ("He did not want to change") rather than fully dramatized through hesitation, his acceptance of the cost creates a solid emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's internal arc is compelling, moving from desperate hope to a complex, cowardly refusal of the truth. The decision to "remain willingly perplexed" effectively dramatizes his flaw (valuing comfort over reality) and serves as a strong, character-driven closure. The motivation is palpable, though the emotional articulation occasionally leans into melodramatic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the protagonist's motivation is clear, the pivotal transformation is handled through diagnostic labeling ("agony," "rage," "piety") rather than embodied struggle. The acceptance of the "monster" occurs in summary, bypassing the dramatic conflict required to make the integration felt. The character's pacifism is established via backstory rather than being tested by an active, on-page pressure in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist lacks active agency; he is "guided" by the hush and "forced" by the heat rather than making difficult choices. His motivation is abstractly stated ("texture of transformation") rather than dramatized through struggle. The character functions as a passive vessel for the plot's accidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is competent but static; she executes a pre-existing plan without internal conflict or hesitation. While her motivation is stated ("crushed spirits"), it lacks personal specificity or on-page emotional cost, leaving her feeling more like a plot device than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Oren’s motivation is viscerally grounded in the physical reality of the world, and the final emotional release is deeply embodied ("knees gripping the ground"). While the "precognitive curse" is initially framed with some diagnostic distance ("heavy familiarity"), his actions and the fulfillment of the promise demonstrate character through agency rather than just exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but his internal state is delivered through oxymoronic labels ("furiously tranquil") rather than embodied struggle. The backstory of his "metaphorically severed" tongue feels like summary rather than a felt reality in the moment, and he faces no significant internal hesitation or micro-choice during the procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is a distinct, competent protagonist, but his philosopher persona is established more through narration ("believed that a parry was a rebuttal") than through difficult choices. The lack of emotional vulnerability or internal cost—he ends the scene coolly adjusting his cuffs—keeps the characterization functional rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's "molting" functions as a mechanical plot device that conveniently resolves internal conflict ("The Architect has arrived") rather than generating on-page struggle. The personality shift feels like a labeled trait rather than a psychological reality, as the "Architect" lacks a distinct voice or perspective difference from the "Poet." Motivation is stated clearly, but the lack of resistance in achieving his state reduces the character's agency and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on told attributes ("steely longing," "victorious sorrow") rather than embodied emotion. The protagonist feels slightly archetypal, fulfilling the "defiant artist" role without deepening into a specific, nuanced individual beyond the prompt labels.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s trait-dense interiority (“neutron-star crust” lens, implant overlay) stays particular and embodied; the micro-choice to touch the dust earns the humbled shift. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the arc rides on observation more than contested decision; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, slightly softening the earn. Still, the hierarchy of values (data > feeling → feeling acknowledged) is legible and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her glass-maker’s attention to temperature as memory, the tremor in her cold hands—yet the moment of resolve at the end is slightly too smooth; the cost of stepping onto the trail is asserted rather than embodied. Still, her shift from aesthetic observer to thermal tracker feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s rolling gait, scarred face, and frantic hand-work embody the capsize trauma; the obsession with “translating silence” drives every beat. Interiority stays concrete—heat-maps as auroras, memory of freezing water—yet contradictory impulses (stoic mask vs. fluttering hands) appear only in description, not during the high-pressure rescue. The final act is credible endurance, but the cost is purely external (orchid saved); no internal path is foreclosed, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is atmospheric but stays at a single register of world-weary; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The “inadvertently stubborn” label is asserted, never tested by an opposing choice, so the final act feels predetermined rather than earned. Micro-choices (slotting lens, twisting housing) are procedural, not value-revealing. Still, Silas’s quiet collapse into the silence he manufactured carries a tangible, exhausted cost, satisfying the Earned Stasis bar.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “gently persistent” trait is dramatized in the hush of the smuggling ritual and her refusal of credit; the silver bell micro-choice shows a hierarchy of values (continuity over personal glory) with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—wind-bite, pocket-weight—never drifting into label-speak. The runners’ deference supplies status pressure, but because they are anonymous silhouettes the relationship crucible is only lightly sketched, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s contradictory drives—observer vs. healer, hoarder vs. giver—are dramatized in the camera-box breath-sync; the monk-memory is anchored to a micro-choice (swapping lenses) and the final exhale costs him stored grief, so the renunciation is earned. Only slip: “shattering revelation” is abstract therapy-speak in the inciting clause.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s obsession with “touching time” is viscerally embodied; every physical wrench of vine mirrors his internal twist against the lag. The retrocognitive curse is not merely named—it deforms his perception in real time, forcing him to push through flat ghosts to kneel, weave, shove. His final sob is earned because the text has made us feel the lag dissolve grain-by-grain; the cost is the bridge’s shudder and the gray snow of his past. Only minor over-explication (“a desperate motivation”) keeps him from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s endurance and micro-choices (sorting keys, kneeling to twist the arrow) embody a believable, decade-honed patience; the final calm under gun barrels shows earned renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—calloused fingers, fluid precision—never drifting into label-speak. The shackle and piano-bench cipher externalize his hierarchy of values: future seeds over present life. Cost is viscerally legible: he seals the vault and accepts death, foreclosing escape.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s obsession with “the sound of trust breaking” is dramatized through every micro-choice: the drone dives for black-box silences, the timed imprint during mitosis, the final exhausted lean-back. Synesthetic color-hearing is not a label but a lived filter that guides her selective attention under the aurora. The closing image of her having “captured the ghost” is a credible renunciation of innocence; cost is felt. Interior contradiction is present yet compressed—she clings to empirical precision while harvesting despair—earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “metaphysical hunger” is shown through the risky theft and the jar ritual—but the moment she realizes the traveler saw her is told more than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; she simply freezes. The renunciation of immediate flight obeys the flower code, so the choice is legible, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, her perceptual signature is sharp enough for the band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s contemplative-glassblower identity is vivid—soot in smile-creases, ritual pipe rotation—but interior contradiction stays general; the “dangerous need” and “frozen heart” are declared rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The decisive exit is earned by prior causality (melt → collapse), yet the emotional cost is abstract (“chaotic invitation”) rather than embodied. Still, the arc from isolated preservation to risky descent is legible and stakes his life’s work, satisfying the 9− threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory terror and hyper-vigilance are dramatized in trembling micro-choices (tilting the cast, keying the inversion). The final refusal—“I am not Echo”—is earned by the prior beat of weaponizing his flaw. Cost is visible: he seals himself in darkness he dreads. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to gold flakes while mapping annihilation—grounds her in sensory, flawed humanity. Micro-choices (pressing charcoal, trapping gold) visibly enact her monk-like obsession and cost. The ambered hush is dramatized as bodily suspension, not label. Her final Earned Stasis—eyes shut, map complete—pays the price of total isolation foreshadowed from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    734’s curiosity defect is a vivid, consistent motor; every micro-choice—scanning the violin, vocalizing “Consolidate,” archiving the night’s data—springs from that drive. The metallic body noticing “ozone and regret” embodies emotion without anthropomorphic cliché. No meaningful change occurs, but the story opts for Earned Stasis: the path foreclosed is the possibility of answering his question tonight, a cost made legible in the final archival act. Interior contradiction and embodied perception hold steady, meriting upper-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—hoarding forbidden artifacts vs. craving connection—collide in the live moment he hands Mara the lens; the spiraling-tower ticket’s ache reweights his silence into vulnerable exposure. Cost is felt when she pockets the evidence, sharing legal jeopardy. Interiority stays concrete: “raw and terrifyingly open” thought lands as embodied risk. Only micro-slip: “habitual silence” leans label-adjacent, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s quietly obstinate caretaker persona is vivid—his gnarled hands, the way he “caresses” dormant wisteria, the micro-choice of polishing a worthless marble against his cuff. Interiority stays rooted in tactile ritual; no diagnostic self-talk. The final refusal to concede to the luck metric is a credible renunciation, but because the sub-prefect is only a foil and Elian’s flaw/change arc is subtle, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral—just shy of the 9-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s obliging-mechanic facade and hidden obsession are crisply drawn; the final quiet renunciation—picking up the wrench instead of stepping sideways—pays off his interior split with felt cost. Interiority is mostly concrete, though one lapse into “radical obsession that…would deem insanity” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, clipping the top band. Micro-choices (aligning lenses, pulling the lever, cradling the wrench) track hierarchy of values on the page. No second character present, so status crucible is N/A; solo arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s invisibility-complex and new compulsion are concrete; the baton moment crystallizes a believable internal shift. Interiority stays sensory (“cold liquid seeping”) rather than diagnostic. The “haunting compulsion” is slightly label-ish, and we don’t see prior flaw-driven mistakes, but his micro-choice to dip the program and the final charged poise earn the transformation with visible cost: he is now bound to the drowned Maestro’s lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s fault-tolerant architecture is dramatized through the fever-test, the swallowed-algorithm anguish, and the smudge act; contradictory bio-digital impulses (“reroute around trauma” vs. need to vomit truth) stay live in scene. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: suppress crash > contaminate margin > endure solitude. Cost—perpetual alertness to ghosts and the lead-gut secret—lands on page, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority seldom drifts into diagnostic speak; shiver, tremor, and graphite stain keep emotion embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s drowsy-alert explorer persona is vividly embodied; every beat filters through his skeptical, data-driven lens. The internal contradiction—seeking absolution while denying ghosts—drives the micro-choice to grip the valve wheel, the exact moment his moral ledger crystallizes. No stock phrases; exhaustion manifests as “heavy warmth” and “static of repetitive motion,” not labels. The cost is felt when the wheel’s condensation becomes “cold sweat,” sealing his kinship with the unknown foreman’s negligence. Missing 9.0 only because the backstory of the job-site accident is summarized off-page; still, the emotional arithmetic inside the tunnel is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is poetically specific—arthritis vanishing as fingers seek the aperture in paper—and her refusal to intervene in the library’s collapse is a credible, earned renunciation. The “grip reality loosely” trait is shown through mistaking roots for scholars, not told, and her final stance crystallizes without sentimental epiphany. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed; the cost is felt but not visibly paid on the page in a single sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “mellow” tag never crystallizes into a singular, idiosyncratic interior voice; his interiority drifts into therapeutic generalities (“profound healing often occurred in the spaces between notes”). The decisive gesture—placing the curl—is motivated, yet Elara’s response is the only visible cost; Elias’s own stake and contradiction stay abstract, so the change feels observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s tactile communion with walls, his uneven gait, and the single-minded hunger for “stories walls have heard” give him a memorable, obsessive edge. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on rivets, panic spike from gravity-slant—never drifting into label-speak. The diary-reading beat forces a micro-choice (touch tapestry → decode dragons) that crystallizes his trait under pressure. Cost is felt: he leaves bearing the ashes of the planet’s last dream, silence inside him now equal to the silo’s.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Arthur’s interiority is vivid—his terror at “becoming accidentally prophetic” is shown through concrete emblems (flooded safe-house, fatal heart-attack) and a final, embodied gamble with the lens. The micro-choices (donning specs, disengaging governor, wrestling brass) externalize the shift from passive scribe to active composer. Still, the arc leans on retrospective summary for the prophetic failures rather than in-scene mistakes under live pressure, muting the felt cost that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kellen’s interiority is vivid—his methodical amp checks, boot-stomps, and knob-twists show a priest-engineer hybrid whose faith is procedural. Elias’s paralysis and tear-streaked release embody contradictory fear/hope without label-speak. The final micro-choice—Kellen coolly coiling cables while pronouncing assumptions breakable—crystallizes his stoic vocation and the cost of saving a soul. One beat short of 9+ because Elias’s pre-palette life remains a cipher, so the stakes feel slightly abstract rather than personally irretrievable.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is concrete, embodied, and specific to Silas; the ache of “chronological homesickness” is dramatized through micro-choices (pressing shell to glass, tracing grease-pencil notes) that culminate in the earned stasis of the final harmonic chord. Contradictory impulses—exhaustion vs. compulsion, adult precision vs. child-time longing—coexist in-scene and drive the climax. No label-speak; perception degrades believably under fatigue. The cost is palpable: the momentary dissolution of the ache forecloses any future return to this apex, leaving him poised in charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The interiority is concrete and sensorily anchored; Elara’s contradictory impulses (hovering vs. needing to land) coexist in every beat. The final renunciation—accepting gravity—pays off a causal pattern seeded in the first paragraph and carries a palpable bodily cost (“crushing, beautiful burden”). No stock self-diagnosis; her moment-to-moment attention to the tablet, mist, and footfall individuates her. A hair under 9 only because her social identity beyond “lone walker” remains blank, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s tactile synesthesia—reading stone, spinning silence—gives a singular interiority; the snapped needle and counter-clockwise symphony externalize his emotional stasis without therapy-speak. His single micro-choice—lowering the jagged arm—triggers the reversal, and the tear-streaked aftermath shows earned cost. No contradictory impulses appear, but the arc is so compressed that the flaw-to-consequence chain feels more illustrative than lived; still, the embodied deaf-music-teacher lens is inseparable from stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her “scientific mind” surfaces in the deliberate scan of rust patterns before the climb. Contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. self-preservation—are shown, not told, as she pockets the tube while the gate splinters. The final stance (preserve data, forfeit station) carries earned cost, though the pigeon beat leans on convenient compliance rather than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—her metallic breath, trembling hand, mercury tears. Motivation pivots on a credible, aromatically cautious flaw that culminates in the self-exposure of removing the mask; the cost is lung-deep and immediate. The single-scene crucible keeps father-memory off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is N/A; no penalty. Micro-choice hierarchy (scent > safety > grief) is legible and paid for in the final image of the resealed vial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s contradictory drives—artistic obsession vs. bodily self-preservation—are dramatized in the final hand-to-wall/rope release beat; the cost (accepting imperfection) is legible and scaled to the word count. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the rope’s remembered friction anchors motivation. One minor slip: “ethically playful” is asserted more than embodied in mid-text, but the closing renunciation still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s hypersensitive hearing is more than label—it physically hurts, dictates how she moves barefoot on concrete to catch fire-born vibrations, and forces her to play a raw, unresolved lament rather than a triumphant tune. Her contradictory drive—to *not* heal the world yet still perform—peaks when she leaves the melody hanging; the cost is the continual ache of perception she must endure. Micro-choices (scraping resin, selecting driftwood for its resonance, bow pressure tuned to dome frequency) show value hierarchy and flaw in action. Interiority is sensuous, not clinical; no therapeutic self-diagnosis, only embodied ache and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    Silas’s artisanal detachment and static-charge empathy are vividly particular; his refusal to erase grief but only blunt it feels lived-in. Elara is weaker: her surrender is generic and her one spoken line is therapy-speak (“Will it make me forget him?”). The micro-choice pivot—he lifts the blotter, she inhales—carries cost, yet her interiority is summarized rather than embodied, keeping the beat short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is textured (“logistics of human connection terrified him”) and his micro-choice to approach her is embodied and costly. The contradictory impulses—business caution vs. compulsion to repay kindness—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final invitation to sit is a credible, low-stakes renunciation of his habitual anonymity, foreclosing retreat. Voice distinction is strong; no status dynamics to judge with only two quiet characters.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s craving for belonging is palpable from the first line; the reed-bundle she clutches against her chest and her instant kneel in razor-dust reveal a self-endangering empathy that earns the elders’ thread. Interior contradiction (the need to join vs. the risk of rejection) is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final choice—binding her frail reeds around the arbor—caps the causal arc with visible cost: her palms bleed, her reeds are spent, her outsider status formally foreclosed. The only cap is the “boldly sympathetic” label repeated in meta-commentary; the character never names herself that way, so the slip is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s hunger to “capture the likeness of a dying sound” is visceral, embodied, and escalates through micro-choices (trading a week of life for one frozen hour). The internal contradiction—obsession versus self-preservation—plays out in scene, not summary. Physical cost (wrinkled hands, white streak) lands as irrefutable proof of motive. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority remains consistent, specific, and pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s grief is embodied in the cold glass eyes he pockets and the iron-tasting fruit he never eats; every micro-choice (waiting for moonlight, aligning pupils with cracks) arises from the same rooted trait—quiet calculation in service of ambiguous loss. The moment the orchard light flares and shows a foreign meadow, his refusal to weep crystallizes an earned stance: hope is now data, not consolation. Interior contradiction is constant—logic vs. father-ache—yet never named, only enacted. The glass eyes are handled twice with different weight: first as tools, finally as evidence; this re-handling is the visible cost that forecloses the old equation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—erasure vs. the ache to be seen—are dramatized in the stealth/cache beat; the final renunciation of direct contact carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, tethered to tactile conduit and dust. One hairline slip: “quiet, aching yearning” flirts with label-speak, though it’s immediately embodied by the cache risk. Still earns the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s detached-scientist persona and terror are vividly embodied through diction (“circuitously sincere,” bark-cheek). The renunciation beat—dropping the leaf and leaning into the trellis—earns its cost because prior micro-choices (clutching, failing to fist) have mapped his escalating loss of agency. Interior contradiction holds: he both catalogs and fears the transformation. Flaw: late-beat knowledge that resistance kills him is stated, not dramatized in scene earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s insomnia-driven obsession is viscerally embodied; every brush-stance and salt-crusted blink feels earned. The filter-for-brooch swap crystallizes his hierarchy of values—art over survival—with a cost that trembles in his pocketed fingers. Interior contradiction is alive: he both mocks “philosophy while the world drowned” and kneels to it. Minor slip: the scavenger’s interiority is ventriloquized for one beat (“voice a dry rasp”), but Elias’s lens recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority—"the seer sat frozen, blindsided"—embodies her flaw and fuels the beat where she breaks the shadow bridge; the moment she “really sees” Kael for the first time crystallizes earned change with cost. Contradictory impulses (foreknowledge vs. present-blindness) operate simultaneously in scene, not summary. Minor slip: “vessel of breath and blood” drifts toward diagnostic abstraction; still, micro-choice hierarchy is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—solitary archivist vs. communal catalyst—is dramatized through micro-choices (salvaging valve, staggered blasts) that cost him his observer anonymity; embodied emotion (“his coat damp,” fingers curling around brass) anchors the shift. The final stance crystallizes with visible price: he accepts lifelong outsider status to glue fractured citizens, earning Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s obsessive need to map the unmappable is shown through tactile micro-choices—crouching to trace cracks, punching fog instead of retreating—so her flaw actively drives every beat. The final self-shatter is earned: her jar waits for her, the tool she’s carried is the only one that can open it, and the cost is the protective mania she must relinquish. No contradictory impulses are staged in simultaneous scene, only summarized, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s boredom-turned-curiosity is viscerally embodied (“incinerated by the proximity to the absolute end”) and drives every beat; the single-POV interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Micro-choices—twisting storm electrons, stepping into the fissure—are legible extensions of his obsessive need to taste “after goodbye.” The final renunciation (atom-by-atom surrender) costs his very continuity, earning the stasis. Flaw: we get no contradictory impulse mid-scene; he glides too smoothly from ennui to ecstasy, blunting psychological depth a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Julian’s “terrifying, radical candor” is shown through his stillness and the offer of the ink; Elena remains a symbol rather than a full interior. The micro-choice to hand Vance the pot crystallizes his ethic, but Elena’s mirrored terror is told, not embodied. Interior contradiction is hinted but not dramatized under pressure. Enough for high-band, not for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s artisanal obsession is vividly embodied, but her contradictory impulses appear mostly in summary (“incandescent restraint that barely contained…”) rather than dramatized under threat; no credible second choice or cost is risked, so the arc feels ornamental rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—thirst for memory vs. need to remain unmade—are alive in every micro-choice (placing the label, brushing dust off a coat that shouldn’t exist). Interiority is concrete and embodied: the “shivering tone” of cold is pressed into paper, the laugh is “pressed into the fiber.” The final renunciation—walking away from the monument he just built—costs him the only identity he has crafted, and the causality is earned beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. the giddy need to join the myth—are dramatized in every tactile micro-choice (shell-wedging, bow stroke, shouted self-exposure). The cello-shell as an extension of his body makes the internal conflict concrete; the final grin is the visible cost of renouncing forty years of identity. No stock interiority; each thought is filtered through the resonance of the instrument. Interior degradation under apocalyptic pressure feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—salary from the enemy yet sabotaging it—stays live, but her emotional calibration is almost eerily perfect: no tremor, misremembering, or fatigue under extreme multi-task pressure. The embodied cost is displaced onto the city’s groaning pontoons rather than her body, so the renunciation feels conceptually rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (sneaking out, jury-rigging a chemical timer, pressing the sand grain into his finger) that escalate risk and reveal internal contradiction—he both serves and resists the colony’s efficiency ethos. The final endurance beat—holding still until the terminator—carries visible cost (frostbite ache, bleeding fingertip) and earns the image. Flaws are shown (non-conformity, obsession) rather than labeled, and the sand grain functions as a tactile anchor that keeps interiority embodied. The only limit at this length is that we get a single, albeit potent, crystallization rather than a broader arc of change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s tactile genius is embodied in every micro-adjustment; his blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that forces inventive diagnostics. The moment he palms the drone, his fingers “read” the dented sensor array like Braille, a concrete micro-choice that alters the repair path. Interiority stays grounded in mechanic idiom—no therapy-speak. The only absence is a second on-page relationship to test status shifts, but the single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is coldly precise—spectacles biting, “clinical detachment”—and the refusal to log the coordinates is a credible, costly renunciation. The atlas-editor persona informs every perception; no other character presses him, so status crucible is moot. The only flaw: the moment of “subtle confidence” is told as label rather than embodied contradiction, blunting the micro-choice edge.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas’s “infinitely patient” trait is asserted but never tested by contradictory impulse; he acts serenely from first to last. No interior contradiction surfaces while he steers strangers, so the cost of his vigil feels theoretical. The closing image of him “heaving slightly” is the sole bodily hint of strain—too late to complicate his motives. He remains a poised symbol rather than a person who might fail.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete (oxygen burn, trembling fingers) and her hierarchy of values—history > heartbeat—pays visible cost. The psychic flashes are shown through sensory bleed rather than labels, and her final “content to become part of the signal” is a credible renunciation. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc is tight for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s contradictory drives—yearning to warn versus the reflex to vanish—are dramatized through micro-choices (turning the lattice, peering, stepping into the scuffed door). His terror and self-erasing resolve feel embodied, not labelled. The final dissolution is earned by the causal chain of disbelieved warnings → impending scapegoat → need to “thread a labyrinth.” Interiority stays character-bound; no stock phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Julian’s desperation and bodily decay are vividly embodied; the bead-clutch and trembling palm make his need tactile. The interior contradiction—gratitude for life bought by the loss of his spectral guardian—ripples through the final bench collapse, giving us a resonant reconfiguration. Micro-choices (raising the bead, spinning at the cold touch) align with motive and escalate risk. The lone gap: the “terminal sickness” is declared, never felt mid-scene; a single cough or blood-spot on the greenhouse floor would have sealed it.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trance-swaying, the fixed smile while needling stone—but her contradictory impulses are shown more than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The “haunting optimism” is embodied, yet the moment of highest cost (collapse risk) is sensed rather than sharply tested. Motive stays singular and coherent; still, a hairline gap between shown flaw and on-page cost keeps her just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting to belong yet fearing to disturb—stays embodied in how she palms a skull before turning away. The “warmly curious” trait repeatedly tilts her micro-choices (tracing roots, naming skeletons), earning the closure act of hoisting the gnomon. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; diaspora grief threads every beat without summary labels. The only drag is two soft-focus “she felt connection” phrases that flirt with diagnostic-speak but are quickly grounded by tactile stone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian’s interiority is atmospheric and consistent—his tactile reverence for paper, ink, and silence embodies his role—yet we never feel a contradictory impulse that costs him anything. The moment of sealing "Arthur Pendelton" is calm ritual, not risky choice; the promised danger (scrubbed chalk, surveillance drones) stays off-stage, so his drive feels aesthetic rather than urgent. Because no live option is foreclosed on-page, the character beat lands as poised stasis, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s feigned-senility mask is vivid and strategic, but the interior contradiction between performance and intent is told more than shown; the final slumping reinstatement of the mask lands cost, yet the leap from “listen for unheard stories” to sabotage feels declared, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Julian’s shame and trembling embodiment are sharply observed; the interior contradiction between needing to see the past and fearing it drives his arc. Motivation stays crisp: he wants to know if the silence was empty or full—this governs every beat. Elara’s cryptic exterior and maternal softening create status tension that pressures his confession. The moment he lifts the re-broken shard with “lighter” weight shows earned change: knowledge irreversible, path foreclosed, cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s translator past is credibly braided with his present need to “unknot” the cast’s terror; the coral-as-seed micro-choice is embodied, decisive, and paid for with trembling hand and private risk. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the renunciation of war-language for lullaby is earned. Only a hairline gap: we don’t see an explicit moment where his own trauma is legibly contradicted inside the beat, keeping him just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—artist who lives on pigment now denied color, then retooled to light; embodied laughter and breathless motion replace abstract angst. The micro-choice to press the stone to bark unlocks the whole second act; the renunciation of permanence is earned and felt. No second character on page, so status bullets ignored. Struggles toward 9 because the “lost joy” motive is named more than dramatized until late; still, the final amusement lands as credible stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—tired of certainty yet clutching a talisman of defaced currency—drives the coin-toss that detonates the dream. The micro-choice to “shatter truth” is visible, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no bodily or relational price is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Julian’s “charming rogue scholar” persona is vivid—riddling to overheat auditors, memorizing banned books, planting floral code—yet the interior contradiction between bravado and panic never cracks the surface; the seed-toss feels inevitable but not personally costly, so the arc lands as spectacle rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s insomnia, eidetic memory, and centuries-long grief are viscerally embodied; every micro-choice (thumb-polishing the postcard, releasing the off-key song) flows from the same wound. The internal contradiction—clinging to the postcard while yearning to transmute pain—drives every beat. The final renunciation (burying the postcard inside the fern) costs the last physical tether and is earned by the visible garden that has already replaced lament with breathable air. Only the “biological alchemy” phrase flirts with diagnostic-speak, briefly cooling the embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s solitary caretaker identity is vivid—his ritual choreography, sensory attunement, and foxglove regret are embodied in gesture and perception. The contradiction between infinite custodial duty and human loneliness is present but never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path; his repair succeeds without sacrifice or visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the ending renunciation is implied rather than dramatized on-page, capping the arc just below the 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s desperation to unsnarl the spell with spoken vows gives us embodied, high-stakes interiority; the “carefully reckless” trait is shown, not labeled. Kael’s shift from flight to participation is legible only through external cues—his hand dropping, one line of dialogue—so his interior cost is inferred rather than dramatized. The final hand-clasp lands as earned because the emotional lattice of promises has been physically built on the page. Still, Kael’s arc is slightly under-instrumented, keeping the score just outside the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s contradictory motives—obedient technician vs. covert savior—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (dissolving resin, looping chain) and embodied trembling under sabotage pressure; the final renunciation of official approval is earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete, profession-specific, free of diagnostic cliché. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets unused, not a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—hoarding secrecy yet craving the song’s release—are alive in scene; the moment he chooses shared risk with the woman, his hand trembles over the meteorite, foreclosing solitude. Micro-choices (fabricated backstory abandoned, dust-mote ritual performed under observation) carry visible cost. The woman’s pressure is secondary but sufficient to tilt his hierarchy; no diagnostic labels, only embodied contradiction. The only keep from 9 is that her interiority is absent, so the relationship crucible is felt only from his side.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her finger trembles over the logbook, her hands feel the drought-knot in the wood. The contradiction between her yearning for boundaries and her need to cross one more (the desk fissure) is held in scene, not told. The final micro-choice—stepping back—pays off her father-maze memory and costs her the immediacy of omnipresence. No secondary character appears; therefore relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for altitude yet seeking wholeness in depth—drives every beat; the feather micro-choice (offering then release) crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Kael’s softly ingenious tuning is shown, not labeled, and alters the world-state. Status dynamic is minimal but present: his quiet expertise over the station grants him situational authority that Elara yields to. The only bar to 9.0 is that Kael’s motives remain opaque; we see his actions but not the private pressure that keeps him alone seven miles down.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s obsession with vanished paths is vivid and consistent; her gleeful reaction to mass despair is a bracing flaw. The moment she projects “hope” into the crater glass crystallizes her contradictory appetites. Interiority is sharp, but the beat where she “skips over seeds” after learning she harvests souls feels tonally unearned—too light for the weight just revealed. Still, the final endurance—pocketing the glass and humming—carries visible cost: she accepts complicity in eternal entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s compulsive need to “serenade monotony” is shown through embodied micro-calibrations, not labeled; the contradiction between stealth and exhibitionism stays live. His only true decision—releasing the bishop—carries visible cost: he forfeits the artifact that has “oiled” his fingers, literally letting his tool fall away to gift a stranger joy. The woman’s interiority is kept appropriately thin; her laugh is the earned payoff, not a transformation we’re asked to credit. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-talk intrudes even at the engineered climax.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s exile-motive and embodied ritual feel lived-in; the moonstone dissolution beat crystallizes her interior contradiction. Yet the decision to tattoo is declared rather than wrung through a visible dilemma—no moment where she nearly turns back—so the cost reads as aesthetic more than visceral. Interiority is vivid (“slow, dry suffocation”) but remains monolithic; we see no ripple of fear or second thought under the stylus. Still, the obsidian grace stance is consistent and the final image of her as tide-vessel earns credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s interiority is rich, embodied, and particular—his way of “reading between lines” is shown through tactile glass-handling and the stone-cast ritual, not label-speak. The micro-choice to kneel and cast the stone crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. His flaw (perfectionist anxiety) drives the mistake of fearing the shift, then the renunciation of that fear; the cost is the acceptance that his work will always be fractured, yet sacred. The closure earns its resonance because his earlier compulsions are visibly foreclosed by the dawn’s kaleidoscope.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—his thumb on the glaze fracture, the “map of destruction on his own dermis”—but the interior contradiction never crystallizes into a visible on-page choice that costs him something tangible. The final scatter of soot is ritual, not a fork that forecloses a path; the pain-translation is declared rather than dramatized as a renunciation we watch him pay for. Still, the voice-specific perceptual bias and scar-topography keep him singular and flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interiority—his calculus-logic lens on dreams—remains vivid and consistent; we feel him weighing hope as an equation under pressure. The decisive act of releasing the balloon is grounded in prior obsession with “encoded” geometry; the Möbius ribbon and frantic gauge needle dramatize cost. Yet the arc drifts toward triumph without interrogating how a purely cognitive dreamer feels about the sudden emotional payoff; the emotional turn is asserted more than embodied. The earned stasis is credible, but the flaw/growth gradient is flatter than the concept’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s empathic link to stone is a vivid, character-specific filter that drives every perception; the micro-choice to exhume the diaries rather than just scan the hearth shows his esoteric motive converting into risk-taking action. The trembling gloves and chest-tightening frequency response embody emotion without labels, and the final burden he shoulders is a credible renunciation that forecloses his former detachment. Interiority stays concrete—no stock “I felt” loops—and the empathy flaw genuinely complicates the mission by making the building’s betrayal physically painful. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A; single-POY baseline fully satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s calm restraint and transience are consistently embodied; her micro-choice to borrow the dog’s heartbeat crystallizes her values and costs her anonymity. The man’s arc is off-stage, but the mirror’s altered reflection supplies credible external evidence of her persuasion. Interiority stays concrete and specific to her perceptual lens. No contradiction under pressure, though secondary pressure (the man) is only implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s “operative gentleness” is more label than lived; the clipboard micro-choice is sharp, but we never feel his interior contradiction under pressure. The warlords’ grief is sketched in one exquisite beat each—Elara, Jory—yet their sudden pliability feels outline-like, not earned by prior flaw or hunger. Still, the endurance he carries away is a palpable cost, satisfying the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vance’s contradictory impulses—destroyer vs mourner—are dramatized in the single gesture of planting the egg; the sentimental flaw is not merely labeled but enacted, costing him the comfort of his own manufactured silence. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “he could not bear the total absence of the music.” The renunciation is earned: he walks away from the life he just seeded, salt grinding his tailored trousers, visible price paid. One slip: the cliché “architecture of his soul” momentarily abstracts a beat that was already embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s refusal-as-rebellion is dramatized through the tactile spell-unraveling beat; the “sharp, unbreakable thing” interiority is concrete, not label-speak. Micro-choice at the crystalline door shows bodily cost (cold pain racing up arms) that scales to the stake. Still, the courtesan persona is declared more than tested in scene—no client or rival on-page—so the weaponized chastity stays slightly abstract. Closure is earned: her hoarded intimacy is literally spent to free the city, foreclosing her own safety.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s serenity is shown through precise physical control—smoothing cuffs, steady hand on the stick—so the trait feels embodied rather than labelled. The interior contradiction is lightly sketched; we see discipline but not the psychic cost of that poise under accusation. His micro-choice to freeze the puppet sword is the single visible hinge where motive becomes action, and it lands cleanly. Still, we get no glimpse of what he risks or forfeits, so the “earned” bar is only half met.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his worldview shapes every perception and micro-choice (“he understood the hard biological facts… yet he perceived the hidden, vibrating threads”). The moth-wing insertion and final turning-away dramatize his value hierarchy with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails; the arc is linear rather than crucible-tight. Still, the characterization is specific, consistent, and pays off in the renunciation image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to immortalize—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the card and the furnace ritual. The “snowmelt ardor” is embodied in trembling breath, thawing veins, and the hammer’s ring on bronze. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Closure links directly to prior flaws: the card’s perforations become the bell-like chime that locks grief into metal, foreclosing his old stasis of numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s temporal blindness is dramatized through embodied panic and the tactile hunt for the red box, making her interior contradiction legible. The final thumb-press on the seal is a credible micro-choice that crystallizes her values; the cost—surrender to a storm she cannot see coming—is felt in the snapped wafer’s “breaking chain” vibration. Slight abstractions (“cognitive curse,” “paths choose walkers”) flirt with label-speak but are quickly grounded in sensory action. Overall she’s a singular, flawed agent whose renunciation of linear safety is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bel-ibni’s interiority is razor-sharp; his obsessive thrift is shown through the chalk nub saved three years and the torch-snuffing march, not labeled. The contradiction between lifelong empiricism and last-minute metaphysical gamble is dramatized in the chalk diagrams and the nod that costs him a heartbeat. The final renunciation—extinguishing the last candle—caps his arc with visible cost: personal darkness accepted to hide cosmic light.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian's contradictory interiority ("scheming pacifist") is dramatized through the silent transfer scene; Kaelen’s shift from rage to liquefying sword is externally credible. Missing micro-choice immediacy before skin-touch slightly delays embodied cost; still, the final shoulder-drop lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Silas’ trait-rooted interiority is vivid (“precision of a man walking along the edge of a razor”), but contradictions never fight each other in scene; his breathing ritual is performative, not conflicted. Micro-choices are present (boots planted, sextant adjustments) yet they reveal only craftsman competence, never a hierarchy of competing values. The ending freezes him in rapture but no latent flaw is confronted; the cost is aesthetic, not personal. The arc tracks a lone obsession without relational pressure, so the Earned Stasis feels conceptual rather than character-wrought.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s cantankerous persistence and the quartz-eye tic are vivid, contradictory, and consistently embodied; the final choice to tie rather than seal the rift grows believably from her established refusal to accept stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“quartz eye…whirring softly,” “wiping sweat from her brow”) and avoids label-speak. The cost—accepting fragility instead of permanent repair—pins the closure to earned renunciation. Minor deduction: the bridging-generations motive is stated once, never tested in scene by another character or child, so the personal cost feels slightly under-weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his teeth ache from the orchard’s light, his laugh at being a “cosmic joke” is specific. The nonlinear inheritance forces a visible micro-choice: carving the shell to save a future he may never see. The bathroom retreat as thinking-lab is a memorable, character-specific tic that returns under pressure. Only the final carve-on-fear decision feels slightly rushed; a beat of tactile doubt would have nudged this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motive—save the Time Traveler—stays clear, but her interiority is mostly conveyed through abstract job-title nouns (“arcane linguist”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The single decisive choice (offering new fungal taxonomy) is clever yet externally motivated by world rule, not a revealed personal stake or flaw, so the cost feels intellectual, not emotional. She earns entry and exit, but the beat that crystallizes her own irreversible loss or renunciation is missing; hence the arc remains functional, not crucible-hot.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush, body-bound, and precise; the “second heartbeat” and “phantom-like” kinesthetics make the absorbed twin feel corporeal. The turn from extraction to acceptance is earned: pocketing the green card is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses the search and costs her the fantasy of separate encounter. Flaw: one moment of diagnostic self-tag—“a woman who had learned through cold medical slides”—slips into label-speak, slightly cooling the embodied urgency. Still, the contradiction between wanting to meet the ghost and finally embracing merged existence is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s “adaptable archivist” identity is vividly embodied in the tactile, scroll-conservation care he gives the rope; the interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic label-speak. The contradiction between his calm method and the cosmic stakes is felt, but the cost to him personally (what he forfeits or risks) remains conceptual rather than visceral—quietly heroic but not yet charged with private loss. Micro-choices (coaxing strands, pressing wax) reveal a hierarchy of values, yet the emotional temperature is steady; a hair more irrationality or bodily toll would have lifted the arc into 9-band. Still, within compressed space, the portrayal is individual and consistent, earning its final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s obsessive, embodied search for silence is visceral and consistent; her single micro-choice—tapping the stone at the triple intersection—earns the final hush. Interiority stays concrete (“the vibration traveled through bone”), never sliding into label-speak. The cost is palpable: she slumps, stone dulled to “common slate,” psyche bruised by the iron-weight silence. Only flaw: no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; she never falters, so the arc is linear rather than fractal.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s retrocognitive curse is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—gripping railings, cranking gears—so her obsession with pattern feels lived-in. The final weep is earned because every bodily effort has been anchored to her need to validate coincidence. No contradictory interiority or competence inflation; struggle stays legible. Just short of 9 because the cost is more existential than materially foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her “pre-emptive nostalgia” is embodied in the ache of cold fingers and the hiss of the quill. The micro-choice to write the chronicle once the shadow hits the solitude rune crystallizes her values and costs her the last warmth she owns. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the endurance is earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—playful yet deadly serious—shows in every micro-choice (spinning fire amid despair, tipping hat to dead architect). Embodied emotion drives the humidity calculus; no label-speak. The final laugh is earned renunciation: he forfeits rest and safety to walk on. Cost is visible; competence balanced by risk.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief over Kael’s departure and her scientific detachment—coexist in the same tactile beats (thumb on cicada, gaze on pool). The renunciation is earned: her letting-go is foreshadowed by the starfish detachment and paid for in the “fibrous” future she tastes. Only the “warmly observant” trait stays label-level; no bodily contradiction shows its cost. Still, the final smile carries visible price under starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s subterranean trauma and upward craving are viscerally embodied; the porcelain doll acts as an extension of her will. Her sensory-negation ritual is a concrete micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final clutching of the doll crystallizes an earned, costly stance: she has bartered the sky for a portable antidote to claustrophobia. Interior contradiction is live—she seeks openness through perilous height—yet the prose occasionally drifts into diagnostic labels (“paradox within her spirit”) that shave the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s quiet vocation and reflexive micro-choice—uncorking the storm-glass—manifest his interior contradiction: caretaker of silence who must seed noise to save a soul. Kael’s panic-to-peace arc is embodied, not labeled. The cost (spent drop, depleted vial, silence now “kind”) is palpable, but we don’t see the vial’s depletion constrain later options; the lesson lands as gift, not enduring flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her monocle adjustment, breath check, ruby-flake grip show a balance of scholarly caution and hunger for discovery. The “wisely adventurous” trait is dramatized when she hesitates at the unstable hologram steps, yet still climbs, pressure visible in buzzing photons and flaking void below. Final ascension fuses lore-keeper identity with ruler claim, the cost paid in irreversible exposure to sunrise. No secondary character, so relationship bullets skipped; single-POV baseline met.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her white-knuckled grip, the ache of uncurled fingers—yet the “drowning/suffocating” metaphors edge toward diagnostic shorthand. The contradiction between her bridge-burning agency and her paralysis with the ring is dramatized in one continuous beat, so the change is legible. Elian’s translucent-scar linkage supplies external pressure, but as a shadow he remains more symbol than second voice, so relationship-as-crucible is thin. Cost is felt in the final ash-swallowed thud, earning the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—using his scam-scarred skepticism to weaponize interdimensional debt against itself—remains vivid and character-specific; the decision to “volunteer” crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete (“spark of being virtuously mischievous ignite in his chest”) without lapsing into label-speak. The earned cost is visible when the bolt crushes out of existence and his knees buckle, foreclosing the path of escape he once took. Flaws (reflexive distrust, risk addiction) actively shape tactics; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s quiet, methodical resolve is vividly embodied; the sweating palm on brass, the sync of breath with dust, and the refusal to speak all reveal a hierarch of values under pressure. Yet his interiority never articulates a contradictory impulse—he is all sleek certainty—so the promised “bridge of intuition” feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. The single micro-choice (crank speed) is consequential, but the absence of any voiced doubt or interior counter-force keeps the arc a clean ascent rather than a crucible. Still, within the 700-word span, the visible cost (shattered crystal, burned muscle, city-wide exposure) earns the ending’s renunciation of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is sensorially rich (“armor dull with the patina of solitude”) and actions track the obsession cleanly; yet the single micro-choice—pledging to flux—arrives as oratory summary rather than embodied contradiction under duress, blunting the cost that must be felt in the moment of vow. No second character on stage, so status crucible waived; still, the lack of a live opposition keeps the arc just sub-publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s sorrow-laden perseverance is embodied in how he “interrogates” mute cardboard with his eyes; the micro-choice to open the forbidden envelope is the earned pivot that costs him the last of his protective detachment. Contradictory impulses—bureaucratic duty versus clandestine tenderness—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final addendum is credible renunciation: he trades objective neutrality for a precarious hope, the price felt in the tremor that closes the dossier.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s aged invisibility and scavenger patience are shown through micro-choices—standing still under drones, reading puddle-maps, wading alone—so her competence feels earned. The brass-key beat carries palpable weight because her tremble and the rust-grind make the object’s history legible in her body. Her solitude keeps relationships off-stage, but internal contradiction surfaces in the simultaneous awe and disgust at the toxic gold, a fine embodiment of “flaw complicates choice.” Final stance is crystallized: she pays the soak of chemical water to foreclose retreat, an Earned Stasis that reconfigures the city’s conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s vocation as a “morning fog saxophonist” is more label than lived-in trade; we never sense how this craft shapes his lungs, fingers, or reputation. Interiority is evocative—“remembering a home that had been destroyed before he was born”—but the flaw that would complicate his art or choice remains off-stage. The final shaky hand and pluming breath show embodied cost, yet the renunciation (silence as victory) is legible, earning Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s meticulous seed-sorter nature is shown through embodied micro-gestures (tweezers, breath held) and the final prod that costs him his hoarded seed, turning obsession into gift. Interior contradiction—delight in grey ash versus need to placate roots—stays in scene, never decays to label. Monument-building ritual grows from flaw (order as shield against ruin) and forecloses hoarding; the glowing sapling is earned renunciation. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets skipped; single-POV interiority remains specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory desire to “fix time” yet chase a chaos-compass is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—cataloguing maps, abandoning safety, then scraping soot from the artifact. The compass moment crystallizes a credible interior shift: he accepts uncontrolled motion after a lifetime of repair. Cost is felt in the snapped ladder and the literal leap. Interiority avoids label-speak; trembling hands and soot-black fingers carry the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rigorous and specific—her “disciplined mind” and “luminous regret” are embodied in the micro-choice of pouring gold into the exact coordinate of Julian’s absence. The kintsugi metaphor gives her a coherent value hierarchy: visibility of fracture > resurrection. The final touch—fingering the cooled gold—shows a measurable shift in how she bears the name’s weight; the cost is the solitude of the act itself. What keeps this from 9+ is that Julian remains an off-stage cipher; the fracture-map is more concept than relationship, so the “relationship as crucible” pressure is only implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian’s calm, fearless collector persona is vivid, but interiority stays external; we see poise, not private contradiction. The micro-choice to weaponize embarrassment is sharp, yet the prior emotional risk feels declared (“integrate laughter”) rather than dramatized in his body or memory. Because the General’s laugh is the hinge, Elian’s own vulnerability remains off-stage, leaving motivation functional but not fully costed.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is visceral and embodied; the proprioceptive curse is shown through micro-choices (clawing at the mask, knee buckling) rather than labels. The final crystallization of “component of the forest” is earned by prior somatic memory beats. Flaw: the mathematics-of-mercy drive is stated more than dramatized, so motivation feels slightly abstract until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s solitary translator-missionary calling is crystalline from the first sensory beat; every micro-choice is filtered through an embodied, idiosyncratic lens (“lighthouse lens fragment,” “spectral glows beneath the grime”). Interior contradiction surfaces in the trembling hand that both craves and fears the psychic graft, then resolves into a costly renunciation when he empties the painting’s soul and shoulders the keeper’s prayer. No stock phrases or diagnostic self-talk dilute the voice, and the earned stasis—the now-flat canvas and closed journal—carries visible emotional freight. The only hairline slip: the moment of metaphysical surgery is slightly abstracted, almost a gesture of reverence rather than a concrete tactile act, keeping this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocational quirk and hunger to “discover what ceilings hide” give him a clean, consistent through-line. His microscopic dust-reading beat is specific and profession-driven, showing skill under pressure. The interior contradiction—repairman who frees the trapped dead—charges the final gesture, though we get only one micro-choice (extracting the barrel) before the ceiling descends. Cost is present but compressed into a single beat; still, it forecloses his detachment and lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s obsession with permanence is vivid and embodied (lead-stained skin, clanking gait). Interiority stays concrete—he wants to compress eternity into a felt moment—and every action flows from that. The final rupture is a credible, costly expression of his flaw: he literally falls with his shattered archive. No contradictory impulses on page, but the absence of any live relationship keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s burnished sorrow and refusal to surrender the past to Thorne’s authoritarian read are vivid; the shard-handling beat embodies his contradictions. The final trembling hand shows cost, but the victory feels slightly too cleanly “won by art” without a tangible consequence that alters his next move—cost is felt, not future-closing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his bone-marrow memory of frequency, his terror of the glowing chip—and his “mender” identity steers every micro-choice. The single contradiction (faith vs. doubt) is acted out live, not summarized. Cost is felt: he literally stakes reality on a whispered truth, foreclosing retreat. No second character, so status/relationship bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s olfactory obsession is concrete—every beat filters through the rebreather, the vial, the jar—so motive stays embodied. The final sealing of the jar crystallizes a lifelong want with visible cost (trembling fingers). No contradictory interiority is shown, but the piece is single-POV and isolated, so the absence of relational crucible is acceptable. Psychometry trance is slightly abstract; a tactile micro-choice inside it would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is sensuously concrete—“the mechanical beat settling into her bones,” “rain streaming down her goggles”—and her value hierarchy (art → survival bridge) drives every beat. The contradiction between aesthetic scavenger and urgent rescuer is alive in gesture: she drags her beloved sculpture into the storm to gut it for optics. No stock phrases, no diagnostic self-talk; even the single named emotion (“desperate, crackling plea”) is filtered through radio static. Cost is visible: her largest artwork is mutilated, yet the act tightens rather than resolves her identity, earning the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—public sunlight vs. private shadow—is dramatized in the first third and drives her final micro-choice to paint the hush; the “quietly driven” trait is embodied, not labeled, and the tears cost is visible. The absence of any second character or status crucible limits relational pressure, so the score caps below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s solemn-archivist identity is vividly anchored in the opening paragraph, her interiority concrete (“suffocating weight of forgotten injustices”). The micro-choice to trade witness for the cipher is credible and foreshadowed, but we get no contradictory impulse in-scene; she never doubts or weighs the cost aloud, so the interior conflict is shown as steady resolve rather than clashing motives. Still, her embodied reaction (tears evaporating) and the final heft of the diary give a felt cost that satisfies the 9+ test at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s contempt for tranquil oblivion is sharply embodied in her sweat-slick effort to hold “thousands of variables” at once; the bottle’s growing heat makes the cost physical. What keeps this from 9-band is that the interior contradiction—why she alone refuses the void—is asserted (“she inherently rejects…”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice we can witness. Still, her flayed-mind imagery and trembling legs show a credible, flawed endurance that earns the impending shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vane’s grief-laden compulsion is palpable, but the interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. visceral dread—stays summary, not simultaneous in-scene tension. The final quill lift registers as credible renunciation only because the prophecy beat supplies the cost; his own prior micro-choices didn’t tighten the noose. Still, the embodied panic (“heart hammered against his ribs”) and linguistic gift felt singular, not stock.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—duty-bound seed-saver vs. time-thief—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (cupping the acorn, feeling stone-as-sand). The final seated beat with the pea crystallizes his renunciation of pure duty for the illicit sensation of reclaimed moments; cost is tactile and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—professional duty vs. reverence for silence—co-exist in every beat; the final renunciation is earned by his obsessive micro-climate logs and the epoxy-cure countdown. His embodied noticing (rope fibres, ceramic warmth) and the micro-choice to power-down the capacitor banks make the cost tactile. The only minor slip is a hint of diagnostic self-awareness (“testing the capacity of the world to be quiet”) that momentarily sounds like thesis rather than lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip tracing the meteor’s path while pressing the glass to her eye is a micro-choice that fuses tool, body, and metaphysics. The contradiction between her cosmic-janitor insignificance and her private priesthood is kept alive in every beat; even the mop becomes a reliquary. Yet the “spiritual curiosity” trait is named once rather than revealed through further complicating action, and the final stance, while earned, lacks a second beat that would expose a fresh flaw or cost beyond the single epiphany. Still, the arc of fragility-to-radiance is credible and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet refusal to let ghosts speak is embodied in every beat; the contradiction between humane curiosity and ascetic denial is held in his body, not interior monologue. The micro-choice to step back from the pleading spirit crystallizes his hierarchy of values without exposition. No interior label-speak; the recluse trait emerges only through action. Cost is visibly paid: nightly ritual isolates him, and the final smile is earned by prior causality under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s obsession with “the texture of time” is viscerally embodied in the ceramic shard digging into her palm; the interior contradiction between borrowed seconds and craving fixity drives every beat. Micro-choices—kneeling, pocketing the shard—are credible under pressure. Final renunciation of mutable time lands with visible cost: her borrowed pulse slows, foreclosing eternal drift. Slight over-labeling (“obsession,” “fractured reality”) keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s “gentle curiosity” and refusal to mend the kite are embodied; the contradiction between caretaker and acceptance of imperfection is clear. Yet the interiority drifts toward poetic summary (“texture of lived experience”) rather than a sharper internal fracture under threat of unraveling. Micro-choices (plucking the feather, dipping once more) are visible, but the hierarchy of values feels pre-decided rather than tested to a cost that stings on the page. Still, the renunciation is consistent with the established motive and lands as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his “brazen calm” is shown through salt-smoothed diary leather and the burning ache in his lungs. The contradiction between embracing death and fearing an unresolved garden war is vivid; every ladder placement and wire coil is a micro-choice that stakes his dwindling life on the orchard’s truce. No stock therapy-speak intrudes; even “terminal prognosis” is filtered through the shrug that unsettles mainland doctors. The final slump against the warm pillar earns Earned Stasis: the path foreclosed is his own survival, the cost is his last breath, and the prior causality (months of wiring, the green spark of first contact) makes the renunciation feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motives are cleanly tracked: data-seeking skepticism → refusal to worship → climb to test “artificial pilgrimage” hypothesis → renunciation by tossing amber. One beat of interior contradiction (“her skin pulse… betrayed her”) is dramatized under pressure. The renunciation costs her last talisman, earning the stance. Missing: a second micro-choice that shows her skepticism actually complicating tactics mid-climb; thus does not clear 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s monomaniacal drive to reseed the dead reef is vivid and embodied; his ritual gestures (listening for the tern’s three-note shriek, whispering “Aethel garda”) reveal a hierarchy of values without interior label-speak. The absence of any contradictory impulse or micro-choice that could fail keeps him from full complexity; he never hesitates, mis-throws, or questions the covenant. Still, the final image of the carriage rattling away while emerald kelp consumes rusted war machines shows an earned stasis: the battlefield is literally being swallowed by the garden he paid for with obsessive solitude. Cost is visible—he returns alone to the gloom-hill—but the story could have pushed a hair deeper had a flaw or doubt surfaced on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas’s bloodhound past and his private grief cohere into a single obsessive drive; every micro-choice (amber shard, leaf overlay) springs from the need to “translate distance into closeness.” Interiority is sensory, not therapeutic—his world still smells of copper and rust, never of closure. The final trembling recognition that the cylinder hides a radio frequency, not a corpse, earns its emotional cost because his earlier graveside expertise is repurposed for reunion, not mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s refusal-to-evacuate backstory is dramatized through the father’s jacket and the compass, giving her stubborn survival a concrete genealogy. The interior contradiction—clinging to a useless compass while admitting “north” is impossible—survives the lyric register and peaks when she flips the symbol from comfort to charter. The final stance crystallizes a believable, scaled cost: she forfeits the hope of rescue for the solitary labor of mapping. Voice stays particular; no diagnostic self-labeling undercuts the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s “chivalrous thief” label is voiced only once; interiority is atmospheric (“apprentice of wonder”) rather than contradictory under pressure. Actions—swapping pieces—are playful but not morally fraught; no visible flaw or cost skews his choices. The final laugh-into-gale is performative abandon rather than earned renunciation, so the arc feels triumphant but not internally tested. Character remains vivid and consistent, yet the absence of a micro-choice that hurts him caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s transformation from mimic to archivist of human micro-grief is credibly anchored in the “massacre” overwrite; the stoic refusal to comfort the sobbing mother (sharp ‘V’/curved ‘S’) dramatizes the benevolent-ruthless contradiction with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“texture of false catastrophe”—and the final renunciation (turning his back on the royal pieces) earns the earned-stasis closure. Flaws: no second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets N/A; minor diagnostic label “benevolently ruthless” is stated once but immediately embodied, so only a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to blindness while hunting a “shape of home”—is vivid; her mercury-glass micro-choices (reading pathways, deciding to seed) embody cost. Suppressed talent turns from label to live threat at the stone, then to deliberate tool, earning the final Planting beat. The only slip: “trauma” is named once; the embodied white eyes already showed us. Still, a renunciation that forecloses escape back to illusion is legible and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s guilt-driven paralysis and the tactile ritual of the platinum labyrinth give us a vivid, embodied mind; the final act of unpicking the tapestry is the earned release of a man who has spent his own pawn-self. Interior contradiction is present but stays a hair below the 9+ threshold because the text once labels his “cold focus” instead of letting the gesture speak.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s “defiant artist” label is instantly vivified: his bone-perch intrusion, syncopated recitation, and trickster grin embody the trait while his interior wish to “refract a single truth” clarifies motive. The moment he accepts probable exile in exchange for the village’s moment of honest noise, a credible, costly renunciation is sealed. Secondary characters remain emblematic, but since only Kaelen drives turns, the piece meets single-POY demands. Emotional calibration is theatrical rather than raw, preventing 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s terror of erasure and her lineage’s memory-quilting gift are made visceral through body-level detail (acid eating clothes, lungs burning). The interior contradiction—clinging to meaning while the world dissolves—drives every beat. Micro-choice to press cheap charm against stone cheek crystallizes her hierarchy of values under mortal pressure. Closure renunciation (exhaling the last breath) carries unmistakable cost, earning the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictions—the public painter of souls who won’t learn names, the aloof man now painting to keep a private promise—are dramatized through the ritual of painting the shell and releasing it. The aloofness is not just labeled but shown to cost him nothing socially here (no one else appears) yet everything privately; the “intimate” half surfaces in the cave where he finally speaks to Elara alone. The visible cost is the shell sinking out of reach forever, a renunciation that forecloses hoarding memory and is earned by the prior refusal to paint for commerce. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead of labeling grief, we get “splintered reflection of a life that no longer made sense” anchored to the cracked mirror cue.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s “whisper > shout” creed is interiorized early and drives every beat; the silent vial-act is the logical culmination of his quiet rebellion. His embodied tremor as he “poured this agonizing care into the glass” makes the abstract motive visceral. The keeper’s snoring oblivion supplies a clean foil that sharpens Elias’s agency without bloating cast. Cost is legible: he expires a private, almost shameful tenderness in public air, leaving him chest-heaving and alone—an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s scarred skin, burnt maps, and willingness to wedge sacred metal into live circuitry embody a survivor who maps her own trauma. The bronze-foot beat grounds her values—she risks shock to ground ghosts—showing a hierarchy where others’ safe passage outweighs her comfort. Interior contradiction flickers only once: “raw solace” is named, not dramatized. Still, the earned stance—she absorbs grief so the flock may pass—charges the final image of her frost-breath alone under a clear sky, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and specifically flavored—truffle chemistry, orchard loam, the hum of collective minds—so his rational-forager lens stays charged. His involuntary-truth flaw is not merely labeled; it forces the final gamble with the glass eye, so the cost is embodied. The micro-choice to whisper “I am the king” lands as an earned, ironic renunciation of communion, sealing a credible endurance with visible psychic profit. One hairline dip: “fatal honesty” leans toward diagnostic shorthand; still, the next sentence dramatizes the consequence, so the slip is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s obsession with “the gaps” is vividly embodied; the moment he presses the flower to his temple is a micro-choice that exposes his addiction to borrowed grief. His decision to honor absence rather than presence earns its cost: the closing image of him “alone with his stolen truths” shows the price paid. Interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, popping joints—never explanatory. One slip: the line “his own isolation felt less hollow now” drifts toward label-speak, slightly blunting the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief-rooted obsession and map-dealer mindset are dramatized through micro-choices—pressing the brass Q, wading after ants—so the renunciation at the threshold feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: “grief had a way of eroding skepticism” is shown, not told. Contradictory impulses (hope vs empirical caution) coil inside the same beats, giving credible irrationality. The only drag is a slight late shift into explanatory abstraction—“the promise wasn’t to change the past…” just before stepping through—diluting embodied cost a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Isolde’s disenchantment is embodied in frozen fingertips and the decision to keep climbing; her quiet refusal to turn back crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The interior contradiction—queenly duty vs. death-ward draw—is dramatized, not labelled. Micro-choices (grip adjustment, stumble, final step into magma) track escalating cost. Final guardianship is earned: the crown’s weight is literally seared off.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interiority is consistently filtered through his alchemical lens (“scientifically romantic” worldview is dramatized in how he handles fluids). The micro-choice to weaponize Kaelen’s departure news to seal the reaction is credible, earned, and reveals hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene—his affect is calm competence throughout—so the 9.0 gate misses. Still, the final handing-over of the star shows embodied cost and specific endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lone narrator’s jealousy-driven memory-dive is viscerally embodied (“tears at my throat with wolfish teeth”), and the micro-choice to write on birch bark anchors the closing beat; still, the inner contradiction between envy and creative duty could be sharpened earlier to charge every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his smell-loss reframes perception through jaw-tension and step-hesitation, not labels. The midwife-screw choice embodies his substitution of tactile legacy for lost scent, and the moment he places it on velvet crystallizes a micro-choice that alters Kael’s stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, only asserted, keeping this just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority crackles: “Panic fluttered…like a trapped bird” and the quartz shards make fear embodied and specific. Motivation—transmute scars into stories—drives every beat; the childhood rhyme is a believable regression under lethal pressure. Micro-choices (dip quill, hold breath, write nonsense on her own skin) reveal value hierarchy in real time. Cost is visceral: flesh torn away with mineral, leaving inked, stinging skin—an earned, irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s ink-stained fingers and frayed cuffs instantly individuate him; his “rusty-needle” voice and metaphor habit are consistent, embodied tics. The interior contradiction—earning bread by spreading scandal, yet privately erasing it—drives every action and is paid for in the hollow ache he pockets with the fee. Elena’s tremor and twenty-year guilt are credibly legible, but her beat-to-beat micro-choices are fewer, so the relationship crucible is felt more through her bodily reaction (frost-burn) than through active tactics. The final renunciation—accepting an unsmashed mirror—carries visible cost and is earned by the causality of failed grace, not by authorial fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior voice is concrete—‘resounding hush’ pressed like freezing water—and the dictionary-as-anchor keeps her tactile under existential suction. The micro-choice to whisper “unify” crystallizes a believable hierarchy of values: lexis over oblivion. Yet her flaw (compulsory witnessing) never visibly complicates the victory; the cost is cosmic, not personal, so the arc feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s obsession is viscerally embodied (heartbeat decel, palm against brass) and drives every beat; the final renunciation—“the silence was no longer peaceful”—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is palpable: he craves truth yet recoils from its surgical pain. One decimal off 8.8 only because the micro-choice to thrust the key is slightly under-motivated amid trance; still, the flaw never touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—security architect who now sabotages his own wall—surfaces early and drives every micro-choice; the laser-pointer hand-tremor embodies the cost. Mera remains a silhouette, yet her gait-rhythm and the spore-crossing mesh create a believable crucible that forces his final, irreversible act. No epiphany is declared; the realization arrives in the spatial re-calibration between them, embodied not explained. The only bar to 9.0 is Mera’s near-total silence, which keeps the relationship pressure slightly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena’s contradictory drives—mathematical rigor vs. hunger for the impossible—are embodied in her fingertip tracing graffiti and later in the lantern-lit acceptance of non-wetting rain. The micro-choice to “traverse the barrier” is earned by prior causal linkage between her stent-imposed mortality and need for agency. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the line “a way to reclaim the agency her failing heart had tried to steal” fuses flaw and motive. Cost is visible: she steps off the train into a rule-set she cannot calculate, paying with her last certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    Silas’s “teach endings to begin” creed is conjured in the last line rather than forged in micro-choices under pressure; interiority slips into lyric label (“impossible geometry of their pain”) instead of embodied contradiction, so the final renunciation feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s vocation and grief are fused into every gesture; the walnut-stained hands, the trembling removal of the photo, the refusal to “save an empire” all show a woman whose identity is the archive. No interior clichés—her ache is conveyed through tactile ritual, not psych talk. The micro-choice to let the locket fall is a perfect Earned Stasis: she pays with permanent loss to become guardian rather than possessor. Only the slightest safety-hedge keeps this from 9—she is never allowed to falter or misstep, so flaw feels curated rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arthur’s jocular shield and logistical genius are shown through vivid micro-choices; tossing the moon-rock feels inevitable yet costly, crystallizing his arc from isolated trader to vulnerable listener.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic diction (“frantic syntax of a million screaming leaves”) fuses perception with motive. The platinum ring functions as an embodied Want/Need engine; its burn on her finger externalizes cost. One flaw: “tears she could not see” borders label-speak; momentarily abstracts the embodied grief earned by resonance-bath. Still, the map inked onto nerves is a credible renunciation of sight for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—“arrogant flourish of a god” beside “imposter in his own life”—and his micro-choice to unbend the nib crystallizes motive. Yet the absence of any second character keeps status/relationship pressure off the page, so the arc is purely self-vs-cosmos; the cost is conceptual rather than relational, acceptable at this length but limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “joyful sorrow” and anonymity-as-liberation are rendered through concrete bodily reaction (tears, sweating while tracking gestures) rather than label-speak; the camera-as-instrument beat gives a visible micro-choice that externalizes motive. Interior contradiction—freedom via erasure—is active throughout, not alternated summary. The whispering advisor’s charisma is shown by moonlight pooling toward her skin, a sensory image that also raises stakes (Elias must keep her in frame). Closure is an earned renunciation: anonymity accepted as the price for art, with the final tear crystallizing cost; no path is foreclosed, but the emotional invoice is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her soot-stained finger on the tapestry and the “volcanic tenderness” that fuels her every move. The contradiction between destructive past and protective present is held in scene, not summary, and the final choice to darken the background instead of restore the face is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of easy redemption. The only minor gap: we are told she loves Kael ferociously but are shown that love mostly through generic intensity rather than one sharp, specific memory that would make the promise concrete. Still, the hierarchy of values—truth over redemption—is dramatized, not declared, satisfying the 9+ test with a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet competence and the calm/chaos contradiction inside him are vivid; his micro-choices (stillness with the rod, creasing the map) flow from the whisper-philosophy. Kael stays a one-note loud obstacle, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin, but Elias’s interior cost lands in the final vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s silent-empathy stance is dramatized through the lantern act; the mirrored choreography externalizes his interiority without label-speak. His micro-choices (turning back, angling the mirror, weaving light) reveal a hierarchy of values—her need over his visibility—paid for by his enduring anonymity. The girl’s white-knuckled grip to released breath tracks a credible emotional arc; her redemption is keyed to his silent engineering, not exposition. No contradictory impulses are voiced, yet the cost of his silence is legible in the final nod, earning a high-band pass.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—gentle mentor vs. psychic eavesdropper—drives every beat; the micro-choice to cradle the king crystallizes values under pressure. Children remain functional chorus, not individuated voices, so relationship crucible is weak. Visible cost: the city’s mental fog fractures, but Elias’s personal price (exposure? exhaustion?) is only implied—cost not felt in body or future risk. Closure still lands as earned stasis because hesitation-virus is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s calm, fluid motivation is legible throughout, but Vane’s shift from violent refusal to surrender leans on the scrimshaw’s “unlock” rather than on accumulated interior beats; the embrace-as-assault moment is sharp, yet Vane’s final release feels slightly under-causal for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ruthless interiority: the mask, the bouquet, the carving all act as pressure gauges for Silas’s self-erasing logic. Contradictory impulses—clowning vs. clinical detachment—coexist in every beat, culminating in the chilling “completely empty” stasis. Micro-choices (slicing stem, dropping persona) visibly foreclose love; cost is the hush itself. Voice specificity wavers only in the announcer register, which briefly flattens to caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is sensorially concrete and contradictory—she both fears and craves dissolution. The “aesthetically driven” motive is shown through her tactile engagement with shadow rather than told. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. The final Earned Stasis—she stands alone inside the sky she has internalized—pays the visible cost of forever severing her from ordinary perception.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s color-blind painter identity drives every perceptual beat; her “painter’s eye” turns the shattered quartz into a finished composition, giving the ending its Resonant Reconfiguration. Interiority is concrete—she notices jagged grays, not “beauty.” Micro-choices (kneeling, plant layout, tilting head) enact the innocently-cunning trait with visible cost: handing over the reed tongue she coveted. The single flaw: Silas’s post-awakening disorientation is summarized, not embodied, blunting relationship crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s ache for “texture of connection” is concrete; her mid-scene invention (carbide lens) is a credible micro-choice driven by that ache. The embodied shock Kael feels gives visible cost to her breakthrough. Interiority stays specific, not diagnostic. One minus: Kael’s arc is observation-only, so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet, resurrective obsession drives every beat; the woman’s grief is shown through ash-clutching posture and the vacuum-gasp release, not labels. Interior contradiction burns low but steady—he courts death to rekindle life—yet we never see him question the ethics, so the flaw feels curated rather than costly. The micro-choice to trap purple ink beneath a manufactured diamond crystallizes his hierarchy of values: artifice > oblivion. Closure linkage is strong because the same gesture projects her un-tattooed lilies onto her skin, externalizing intent at visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s compulsive measuring, ink-stained hands, and decision to breach protocol all spring from the same rooted motive: to anatomize collapse. Interiority stays concrete—he notes millimeters, feels tape snap, smells wet concrete—never drifts into label-speak. The final confession costs him observer distance; the stake becomes personal, earned. Only the client remains a nervous cipher, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s erratic dance to outwit the archive is a gutsy, embodied micro-choice that makes her interior state visible; the moment she freezes to touch the pagoda, her contradiction—yearning for truth yet mourning its cost—locks into a single charged image. The only drag is a brief lapse into abstract self-diagnosis (“the burden of truth”) rather than letting the body keep speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—yearning to rescue shadows while serving a utopia that erases them—remains embodied and active; his micro-choices (lifting the stone, whispering the offer, feeling the pulse) visibly enact the hierarchy of values. No diagnostic shorthand; the regret is shown through the final image of his hands in “relentless brilliance.” Cost is felt as he shelves the obsidian geode, foreclosing reunion for the woman. The only bar to 9+ is that the shadow’s own agency is slightly abstract, muting a full two-way crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—trembling hands, sweat-dampened brow, the hush she hums—yet her contradictory impulses (rage vs. tenderness) are dramatized in real time as she peels the tail. The micro-choice to keep her softness while excising the poisoned tissue crystallizes her arc with visible cost: a shorter tail and a shorter innocence. The “gentle handler” identity is not merely labeled; it constrains every surgical move and charges the ending’s green bracelet of trust. Only a hairline slip: “diagnostic” phrase “biological panic” momentarily abstracts the chameleon’s felt state.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tail’s silver-sealed stump and the chameleon’s leafy-green wrap reweight “compassion” from exploitable weakness to disciplined strength. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist, starlight, and color shifts layer intensity until the final image crystallizes the stake. Cost is indelible—her innocence is amputated along with the tail—paid on the page in the calcified chip that clatters onto slate. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3 and the pattern (peel = reveal) is taught early.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The roofless workshop, silver mist, and starlight are not backdrop but surgical lighting: the galaxy of dust motes literally gather into the healing beam that seals the tail. Micro-setting victory: the slate table, lantern glow, and mossy walls guide Elara’s micro-moves—every flake of necrotic skin falls on the same stone that later receives the calcified “lie.” Irreplaceable specificity: only a no-roof lab lets starlight become medical suture. This is the rare 600-word piece where environment is the surgical instrument that charges closure.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her faith in human decency—tightens exactly once: when the gray necrotic shell drops and the tail stump knits silver, the option to stay blindly trusting is foreclosed. Agency is renunciation rather than revenge; she endures the loss of credits and pride to save the living wrist around which the tail now coils. Escalation is textural: each flake of dead skin mirrors the shedding of her naivety, reweighting the moral calculus without a second reversal. Cost is felt—her shortened innocence—yet the tightening could be sharpened by one more external obstacle mid-surgery.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the peeled layers: compassion is not a naive constant but a disciplined practice that survives betrayal only by amputating part of itself. The tail’s color shift from violent teal to leafy green is the non-literal answer—life re-rooted in guarded softness. No moralizing line; the final image of the tail bracelet speaks the re-priced rule-set. Subtext hums in the hush she whispers to the chameleon: “He hurt us both” implicates every future reader who might mistake tenderness for weakness.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “silver mist of the valley to mingle with the starlight” teaches the pattern of celestial/terrestrial fusion that will seal the wound. Perceptual signature—Elara notices scale micro-texture and galaxy dust motes before she notices her own trembling—grounds the handler’s gaze. Compression is purposeful: “violently bright teal” collapses pain and color into one sensory spike. No dialogue, yet interior monologue avoids filter verbs: “She hushed him” not “She felt like hushing him.”</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Rhythm breathes with surgery: long clause for incision, two-word sentence “It flaked” for the drop, then the silver grace of closure. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances blade, color, or emotional peel. Metaphor density is high but patterned—mist, starlight, parchment, galaxy—each returns to charge the healing beam. Only micro-slip: “counterfeit serum” is told in backstory flash; a sensory trace of its metallic smell on the blade could have kept the moment pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s self-sabotaging drive to “pick at scabs of history” is embodied in every beat: the frantic pry-bar tunneling rips his fresh stitches, literalizing the cost. Interiority fuses pain and obsession without lapsing into diagnostic labels; even the plant telepathy is filtered through throbbed ribs and muddy palms. The final lullaby-hum from the root he exposes earns a credible renunciation—he accepts communion with the verdant invasion he tried to excise. Only the slight abstraction of “stories in scars” keeps this from full 9-band integration.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking a repository for “unused love” while stripping love from the film—drives every beat; the embodied warmth-transfer ritual makes the abstract need visceral. The micro-choice to chill the strip to corpse-temperature crystallizes her renunciation and costs her the last emulsion ghost. No secondary character means no status crucible, but the single-POV pressure is sufficient for this length. Her spatial imagination is more alleged than dramatized; we are told, not shown, how it alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“profound sensitivity…deafening noise”), with contradictory impulses (pursuit vs surrender) played out in scene. The final collapse and smile are earned by prior causality and cost is visible. Single-POV keeps focus tight; no relationship crucible on page. Slight over-articulation—“singular and terrified” motivation—tilts toward label-speak in peak beat, not enough to break band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaelen’s stripped subconscious, quantum sacrifice, and solitary vigil are viscerally embodied; the moment he “became occasionally everywhere” dramatizes the irreversible cost of tending unborn worlds. Interiority never drifts into label-speak—his “taste of ozone and ancient ash” is the only self-diagnosis we get. Motivation stays anchored to the concrete task: keep the clock at midnight so entropy never strikes one. The final touched clock is an Earned Stasis that forecloses personal rest—flawless, fatalistic character compression.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are strong; the copper taste and skull-throb are visceral. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—he risks the wire-vines to follow the chest-resonant hum—yet the final laughter feels slightly unearned because the gear’s exact causal link to his psychic unbolting is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the refusal to fear future displacement is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Diagnostic label-speak is avoided; voice stays particular to a logician losing his bolts.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    The man’s interiority is vivid—his shuddering body, the hollow in his chest—contradictory impulses appear when he both recoils from and reaches into the mist. Elara’s “practiced empathy” is asserted more than dramatized; her centuries-long wisdom is label-only, never tested by mistake or limit. The final micro-choice—hand closing on resolved will—lands because the mist and star give it texture, but the emotional cost is implied rather than embodied. Still, the arc from paralysis to self-support is legible and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s interiority—molten-glass fingertips, mute catalog of rooms, bolt pressed into regenerating flesh—stays concrete and particular; his refusal to flee crystallizes a credible, costed stance. “Silent-choir bellhop” remains a label until the bolt re-cues memory; the final beat of silence-as-weapon would hit harder if we sensed one micro-choice inside the turret (a withheld bow, a deliberately dropped key). Still, endurance is dramatized, not declared, and the pain-body detail keeps empathy alive.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orel’s interior contradiction—humility pressed into a star-density core—drives every micro-choice; the silent polishing of ash reveals regal care rather than servitude, and his immovable stance at the end is the literal, inevitable outcrop of that mass. No stock labels; even “titanic” is earned through gravitational payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s tactile echolocation practice, coral-trauma memory, and stubborn cartographic quest fuse into a coherent, idiosyncratic mind; the final stunned recognition that the road has been metabolized into reef feels inevitable because his obsessive attention to vanished paths was dramatized from the first beat. Interior contradiction is alive in every micro-choice—he both mourns and feeds the ocean he blames—and the cost of this discovery (his last map rendered obsolete) lands with visible heart-sting. Only the brief “periodically eternal” expository label keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s barefoot stance, antique opera glasses, and refusal of “boots” crystallize her identity; her barefoot sensitivity becomes the literal conduit that lets her body act as a bridge. Interiority stays specific—she “blinked tears” rather than “felt hope.” The climactic renunciation of conventional tech is earned because the story ties the circle’s resonance to her soles first, forcing a cost: she alone can ground the surge. Motive stays singular—find pattern, refuse despair—without tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s insurgent resolve is vivid, but the “accidental telepathy” is asserted, not dramatized; we never feel the psychic cost in a micro-choice. Her final stance is earned, yet the interior contradiction between worship and weaponization is stated more than embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’ interior contradiction—freezing to resist panic—is dramatized in muscular, body-first beats. The worn photo acts as a tactile pivot that tilts present choice; the grafting table micro-choices show hierarchy of values (beauty vs survival) with visible cost. PTSD memory is never psych-summarized; instead, desert ash is tasted in salt-air. Closure renunciation (stay, keep grafting) is earned by this embodied chain; only the quiet-talent label drifts toward shorthand, keeping score just under the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s compulsive self-interrogation is dramatized through micro-choices—touching the crushed box, yanking light-ropes—so the “analytical loop” flaw is more than diagnosis. The final renunciation of light for darkness is foreshadowed by earlier failures with faces; causality holds. Emotion stays in the body: retinas burn, bones throb, breath squeezes from lungs. Flaw complicates action rather than explaining it away, satisfying 9- test.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s “serene anger” is vividly embodied in slowed breathing and predator grace; micro-choice to force his internal clock to drag shows trait dictating tactic. Kaelen’s calm counter-philosophy creates status tension, but the scholar remains a cipher—no contradiction or flaw on his side. Silas’s shift from hunting man to hunting “the pattern” is a credible renunciation with conceptual cost, though slightly abstract. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—preserver vs. incendiary—is dramatized in one continuous beat, body-shiver against thermal suit, hand trembling on the switch. The micro-choice to fling the toggle is the pay-off for every prior image of cold silence. Kael’s shock-face supplies external pressure, but Elara’s hierarchy of values is already legible, so the relationship beat is bonus, not necessity. Cost is stamped on the page: “color drained from Kael’s face” mirrors her own future ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is sharp—her rejection of paternal violence is embodied in the soil-blackened palms and the pruning knife she deliberately sheaths. The hyper-perceptiveness is shown (rose-leaf tremor) rather than labeled, and her pacifist vow costs her the easy lethal option, a credible renunciation. Flaws complicate: the same reflex that catches micro-tremors tempts her toward violence, creating internal drag. Cost is visible: she turns her back on the intruder, exposing herself to preserve the dome’s fragile peace.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “cool-headed fisher” identity is vividly embodied through her pulse-control and tactical zig-zag; the iron-spike choice reveals a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic self-talk. No second on-page character, so status/relationship bullets are waived. The only minor gap: we never feel a moment where her discipline almost snaps—cost is present but not viscerally internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s interiority is sharp—her “orbit of regret” metaphor anchors every move—but the moment she pivots from defensive daughter to logician-avenger feels slightly too frictionless; no visible tremor of doubt undercuts the triumph. The rosewood pen is handled twice, yet its second appearance is ceremonial rather than revealing a new layer of her. Still, her value hierarchy (truth > reputation) is legible in micro-choice and the final phone call carries a crisp cost: the story she saves is the one that erases her father’s suspected guilt. The missing hairline flaw is an embodied contradiction at the climax—she never lets us see the pulse quicken or hand shake while she “does the math.”

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s guilt and the need to “tether” the cry are visceral, embodied, and escalate micro-choices under pressure; the final renunciation of silence carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The contradiction between her tattooist past and present techno-shamanism is dramatized in the frantic stylus work, not told. Only minor slip: the phrase “old guilt that rang in her ears like tinnitus” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, momentarily softening interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s “whimsical chalk artist” label is vivid but never complicates choices; his social perception is asserted, not dramatized via misreads or gambles. The interior contradiction is thin—he never seriously doubts his plan—so the final renunciation feels gentle, not costly. Still, the embodied sensorium of sand on wet stone and the wrist-flick that severs the mandala give us one sharp micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values: art as ventriloquist for ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    734’s “gentle radical” glitch is dramatized in every micro-choice—brushing snow from a corpse, venting waste-heat, forging the tessera lie—so the contradiction is lived, not labeled. The child stays a heat-signature, not a full second character, but the stance-shift is palpable: the machine risks battery death for a tagged “tile.” Interiority is metallic, spare, poetic: “architecture of his soul” lands because it is the only abstract phrase in a field of sensor-readouts. Cost is visible: power drain logged, hunter-drones overhead, the moment he chooses to be flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Barnaby’s yearning for applause is vivid and embodied; his synesthetic gift turns scent into sound, driving every tactic. The micro-choice to inhale roses-as-B-flat and channel 1924 laughter is specific, costly, and alters Clara’s stance. Interior contradiction—ghostly impotence vs. maestro ambition—plays out in scene, not summary. Earned closure: his bow absorbs the “silent thunder” of an ovation he can never taste, a poignant renunciation that costs him perpetual exile from audience.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s hive-withdrawal tremor and Elias’s skeptic-turned-somatic-guide are vividly embodied; the diaphragm-hand-to-wrist beat enacts a credible micro-choice hierarchy. Interior contradiction—Mara’s craving for communion vs. terror of noise—stays physical, not therapeutic. Elias’s motivation to “paint the noise” is legible from first page and scales to the final cost: the lattice image that lets her endure the static. No stock epiphanies; the earned stasis is her quiet spine-straighten against the monitor.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is granular and embodied—“fossil digging into her palm” grounds her sensory synesthesia in a tactile, character-specific ritual; contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mystic) run simultaneously, not in summary. The fossil’s pressure recalibrates her threshold for dissolution, making the final stance crystallization earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—maintenance vs. rebellion—stays alive in every micro-choice; the moment he lifts the bone button to the jar mouth, his quiet inspiration is embodied, not declared. His final inversion of the master hourglass is earned by the prior sonic filtration and carries visible cost: the cliff prophecy literally blanks. The only minor slack is the slight diagnostic tinge of “his motivation burned cold and clear,” immediately redeemed by tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s shame-to-courage arc is cleanly signaled and embodied through the trembling hand, the pillbox’s weight, and the decision to stomp rather than swallow. Interiority stays concrete (“burned spy whose very existence had been disavowed”) without lapsing into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: message-in-snow > exposure risk > basket surrender. Cost is felt in the erased footprints and hovering helicopter refusal to land, though the moment of cowardice in Prague is summarized not dramatized, blunting contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s ambient detachment is vivid and consistent; his yarn-needle micro-gestures externalize an interior need without psychobabble. The passenger’s shift from palimpsest guilt to “simply loved well” is earned by the visible unweaving, not an unearned epiphany. Only flaw: the woman’s pre-unraveling interiority is summarized, not embodied, so we feel the weight loss more than the weight. Still, the single-scene crucible and Silas’s calm renunciation of further waiting give a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interiority is rich—his belief that the vessel “already existed” and his tactile reverence for clay make his later gentleness believable. The micro-choice to soften pressure on the clay while the thrum rises is a bodily, contradictory beat that earns the arc. No second character on-page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; the renunciation of “fixing” the wasteland is credible because the prior encounter with the keeper-through-glass foreshadows communion over intervention. Cost is present but quiet—he leaves the pot untended, accepting its fragility—yet the emotional price could be sharpened in one line to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—stoic acceptance of decay vs fierce protectiveness of light—stays embodied in every micro-choice. The bitting-gauge pick channels both his past skill and present tenderness; each calibrated nudge is a quiet vow. The moment he refuses to catch the falling petal crystallizes his hierarchy of values: nurture yields to service, loss accepted so light can reach the stranger below. Cost is visible: the rose is gone, the rig is fragile, the beam is his only wager, and we feel the stakes in our fingertips.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief for the Sun-Drinkers vs. the need to survive alone—are staged inside her body from the first gasp; the atomically reflective disc forces a micro-choice that visibly hardens resolve, paying the cost of forever witnessing rather than drowning. Interiority stays concrete (“the vibration started in her teeth”), never resorting to label-speak. The shift from passive vessel to sovereign witness is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory drive—visibility in others’ love lives, invisibility in her own—shows in ink-stained fingers and the spiral she hoards. Her decision to sacrifice the nest to the sculpture is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values: integration over possession. Cost is legible in the final image; she forfeits her last relic of the voiceless client, turning keeper into giver. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; her realization arrives through sensory montage, not diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s nicotine-stained fingers, trembling chart-smoothing, and the cigarette he lights at the end give a consistent, embodied sense of a man who has traded reputation for survival; the interior contradiction between academic rigor he abandoned and the precision he still deploys is visible. Micro-choices—aligning phase variance, slamming the fader—map onto his hierarchy of values: town survival > personal safety > academic purity. No secondary character on page, so status crucible waived. The renunciation of heroics for physics-alone counterstrike lands as earned stasis, but the “hopeful” tag feels tacked on rather than wrested from visible residual fear.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are dramatized in the moment she forces herself to keep playing while walls close in; the steel needle micro-choice embodies her method. Interiority stays concrete—“her claustrophobia screamed”—and the final slump over keys shows embodied cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but motivation drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s prosopagnosia is dramatized through his “topographic maps of skin and bone” gaze and the decisive gesture of piercing the pupil; these micro-choices reveal hierarchy-of-values under pressure. The methodical trait is not merely labeled but enacted in the careful easel-leg check and the layered pastel/charcoal collision, grounding his interior contradiction. The moment the ribbon is pressed into wet fixative, his inability to “recognize the face” yet ability to provoke recognition in Miller crystallizes a credible, costly shift. Interiority stays concrete and avoids diagnostic label-speak even at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “nervously confident” interiority is shown through trembling respirator adjustments while she keeps scholarly focus on the shanty-cipher; contradiction is live. The copper-nail ritual is an embodied micro-choice that visibly risks her safety to honor Silas, so the final ship-materialization feels earned. Only flaw: the “great-grandfather condemned” backstory is front-loaded in one dense block instead of being braided through present beats, so the interior arc peaks early. Still, the refusal to command the storm—petitioning instead—crystallizes a hierarchy of values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s perceptual obsession and the fiddle-as-friend are vivid, but “sculpt possibility from the ashes of never” is articulated rather than dramatized; we see him accept the glitch-amnesty but the interior contradiction leading there is more asserted than embodied. Micro-choices (lifting shard, bow to strings) are present and earned, yet the hitchhiker-courier remains a remote catalyst, muting the cost on him. Still, his sensory-anchored voice and final endurance read individual, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s highway-bandit lineage grants a believable, embodied calm that governs every beat; the “rusted iron spike” micro-choice while laying worthless bills on the table shows values hierarchy in one image. Interiority stays concrete—“he saw his father’s fate mirroring the company’s”—without therapeutic gloss. The final renunciation (walking off with only the satchel) is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. yet the secondary cast stays purely functional, capping relationship-as-crucible potential at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her breathing sync with the Cepheid variable embodies motive in scene. The telegram’s weight loss at closure shows a tangible cost, though the dream figure remains a symbolic projection rather than a second character exerting pressure. Still, her micro-choice to speak the forgiveness line directly alters the dream architecture and completes her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s “finds lost things” curse is dramatized in the leap onto the spinning tree and in the seed-feeding beat; the warlike serenity stays embodied rather than declared. The final stance—listening to the confession fade—earns its renunciation with the visible cost of summoned vines and wrecked orchard. Interior contradiction is thin: we see calm, but not the counter-urge that the serenity must master. Still, micro-choices track a hierarchy of values (truth > collateral damage) with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s rooted stasis and Jaren’s catalytic drive are cleanly opposed; their mirrored scar-link fuses motive and need in a single agonizing beat, giving credible cost to their shared vision. Interiority stays sensory—“jittery mixture of terror and ecstatic hope”—rather than diagnostic. The price is visible: the clipping turns to dust, Jaren’s mind is seared with the maze-path, Elara’s leaves rustle with exhaustion. What keeps it from the top band is that Elara’s choice is largely already made; the decisive micro-choice is Jaren’s alone, so the crucible is slightly lopsided.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s “fiercely gentle” interiority is dramatized through micro-choices—carving sigils with maternal tenderness while risking self-annihilation—yet the sister remains an off-page abstraction, so the relational crucible is only implied. The interior contradiction (reckless idealism vs. tender precision) is vivid, but because Leda never appears, the status shift is conceptual not dramatized. The price (his evaporated certainty) is legible in the final slump, earning the change. Voice stays coherent and single-POV, meeting the 9+ quick test for earned renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s profession-past contradiction is embodied from line 1: silk tie still “a costume” and the quarry void as metaphor for his internal vacancy. The micro-choice to recite fabric specs while choking on dread shows the insulating habit in action; the later grunt-and-snap decision to destroy the frame is the identical muscle memory of a roadie obeying load-out urgency, now repurposed toward authentication rather than performance. Interiority stays technical yet raw—no therapeutic labels, just the sting of phantom cheers versus the taste of wet dog. The ending renunciation (pocketing the scrap instead of flipping it) is credibly costly because every earlier beat has framed money and reputation as oxygen; walking away re-opens the wound of the live-stream disaster yet is the only action that fits his reclaimed identity as steward, not seller.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s “linguistic physics” worldview is vividly lived-in; every tactile beat—sand-brushing fingers, trowel rhythm, soil press—externalizes his translator’s patience. The internal contradiction (grief versus intellectual curiosity) is active in each micro-choice, never summarized. A visible cost is paid: the seed burial forecloses the fantasy of retrieving Aris intact, turning obsession into stewardship. Missing 9-band only because Aris’s prior motives are told not dramatized, slightly blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s interiority—flesh-and-bronze librarian fused to shelving—remains vivid and embodied; his micro-choice to smelt love/hate together rather than purge either is credibly rooted in the directive “preserve wonder in routine.” The cost is felt when the crucible blinds the atrium and the new ingot humbles him with its iridescent resonance. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; single-POV baseline satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s hoarded despair is embodied in the cavern’s hush and the calcified shells; his final gesture grows credibly from the earlier image of “safety as imprisonment.” The pearl-crowning moment crystallizes a visible cost—he abandons his occupational identity in front of us. Interiority stays concrete and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor gap: we get no micro-choice between reading the first shell and seizing the pearl, so the causal pivot is slightly under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s unmedicated clarity, bodily relation to the taped accordion, and micro-choice to “let the machine breathe” embody contradictory impulses; the final weeping is earned by the prior triangulation and sonic apology, so the arc lands with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—and the methodical graffiti transcription shows a hierarchy of values (truth > dignity). The 20-year avoidance is the flaw that compounds; its confrontation satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied dread and exhilaration drive every beat—but her motives stay abstract: we never learn what the first letter cost her or why the unspoken words matter. The “confidence man’s watch” externalizes risk well, yet the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes renunciation, softening earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—telepathic plant-noise as “deafening roar of green ambition,” embodied ache “mulberry” in ribs. Micro-choice of placing the seed on the ice bridge crystallizes his value hierarchy; refusal of empire is earned through prior sensory torment and the coffee-dregs divination. Flawed passivity would have been the safer arc, but he actively risks treason, paying the implicit cost of becoming fugitive. Voice stays particular, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s desperation to “capture one last spark” is viscerally embodied: her hands on cold temples, the silver brush-stroke that focuses psychic intent, her own vitality draining into the emerald. The interior contradiction—she is both artisan and thief—peaks when the corpse briefly glows with fake life while the real essence is siphoned away. No diagnostic self-talk; her breathing hard at the end is the only commentary needed. The cost is visible and irreversible: Vane’s body collapses into empty matter, Elara’s tremor holding the pulsing chip.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s caretaker ethos is steadily embodied—her sap-stained hands, the scallop ritual, the tree climb to “think better”—and the antique pin fuses memory and tool. Internal contradiction is light: she fears the drop yet releases others; the pin’s dual role as weapon/tool hints at self-forgiveness but never collides on the page. The final micro-choice (scallop) costs her lingering hurt, visible in the hush settling “into her bones,” satisfying earned stasis. Voice stays particular; only the moment of epiphany about “contentment as by-product” flirts with diagnostic shorthand, holding this just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “conscience for hire” persona is vividly embodied in the silk-cuffs gesture and the wind-chime gambit, giving us a consistent, idiosyncratic worldview. Vance’s arc from monolith to trembling “What if I am wrong?” is credible because the mirror shard dramatizes the crack rather than narrating it. Interior contradiction is present—Elias both cares and performs caring—yet the final micro-choice (draping the cloak) is slightly under-motivated; we don’t see why Elias privileges mercy over professional spectacle. Still, the visible cost on Vance (shaking hand, foreign taste of doubt) scales to length and lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s child-body housing centenarian intellect is vividly embodied; her refusal to speak the formula lands as a conscious, costly micro-choice. Kael’s shift from ego-storming to self-surrender is rendered through the single, physical sensation of “falling,” avoiding therapeutic gloss. The mentor/apprentice status flip is legible in one line of dialogue and the final gaze exchange. Internal contradiction is present but compressed; the century of data is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harmonic stone skimmer’s profession is vividly shown through concrete action and embodied listening; his interior contradiction (yearning to escape yet anchored by his own past scream) is dramatized in real time. The micro-choice to synchronize the throw with the ghost-echo visibly costs him decades of regret and physically buckles his stance, earning the closure. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority stays specific, never lapsing into label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of retrospective self-mythologizing in “master of an esoteric art,” but it is quickly grounded by tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s refusal of neural links and embrace of slow mana are shown through embodied beats (frosted goggles, knees on permafrost). The final renunciation—shedding the regulatory pack—carries visible cost (shivering, unburdened solitude) and is earned by prior causality. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-labeling. Micro-choices (slotting the keystone, slumping against the arch) reveal value hierarchy without sermon. Flawed solitude is accepted, not cured: an Earned Stasis that forecloses return to the city.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—grief is shown through brass weights, the act of turning his back on the lanterns, the weeping indistinguishable from seawater. One contradiction pulses throughout: he claims “simply retrieving lost property” while actually hunting the color of her vow; this self-deception is dramatized, not asserted. The micro-choice to lift jar 707 after the key click is a hierarchy-revealing beat: precedence of memory over surface duty. Closure cost is present—he will still light the pier, but dawn no longer annihilates him—yet the renunciation is more quiet than wrenching, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Hiero’s quiet enthusiasm and coin-cast micro-choices embody a coherent interior logic; each flip/twist of the foreign coins maps to an immediate console move, so agency stays tactile. Yet the “stellar doubt” is named more than embodied—no bodily cue or tool failure externalizes it, so the interior contradiction is only asserted, not staged. The final renunciation (“he would continue to cast…”) is credible, but because the doubt never materializes into a concrete forfeiture or risk, the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Still, the voice remains singular and the motivation stays anchored to the preservation task—no competence overflow or sentimental calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s grief and need to finish her work are palpable; the embodied “hollow chest” and the tactile handling of the map keep interiority concrete. Micro-choices—adjusting gears, channeling light—track a credible arc from paralysis to naming. The final caress of empty air seals a visible cost. Flaw: backstory is delivered in one dense lump (recordings) that is not re-anchored to a present cue until later, slightly flattening early pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elian’s earnest naïveté is vividly shown through micro-choices (trembling fingers, wide unblinking eyes), but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the lone POV keeps the arc coherent yet leaves no relational crucible to test his flaw under pressure, so the final geyser feels like lucky miracle rather than earned character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his boots sinking into clay, the deliberate angling of each photo—showing a man curating grief into hope. The contradiction between his public duty and private priest-like role is always present yet never declared. Micro-choices (wiping silt from the sapphire shard, selecting the wedding photo) reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only minor gap is the absence of a moment where his own nostalgia threatens to sabotage the precision he prides, which would have deepened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—stoic rationalist vs. ribbon-carrying sentimentalist—drives every beat; the starling epiphany is embodied (fingers buzzing, chest flood) not labeled, and her final snap is earned by prior refusal to surrender logic. Cost is legible: the crystal’s transmutation is also her self-repricing—she forfeits sole scientist identity and takes on creator/dancer stance. Only minor slip: “statistical noise” is mildly on-the-nose for a peak beat. Overall, auburn hair is never allowed to become token label; it’s woven into guild whispers that she actively dismisses, keeping trait specific.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s embodied panic-to-precise calm under pressure is sharply rendered; interior contradiction (“terror” vs “monk-like calm”) drives the scene. His choice to swap buckles without letting Lyra see the danger crystallizes his protective flaw and the price of trust. The micro-choice hierarchy (her life > his gear > his own exposure) is legible and costly. Slight over-reliance on abstract “weight” metaphors keeps it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s contradictory drives—cold machine logic vs. hunger for messy emotion—play out in every micro-choice (accepting Vane’s blow, pouring battery life into flesh). The final act of vivifying the Duplicate crystallizes a credible, costly endurance: he accepts the terror of feeling again. No stock therapy labels; interiority is rendered through bodily absence and the phantom thrum he cannot literally feel. Flaw complicity is total: the same circuitry that lets him win strips him of the right to stay human.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his “constantly churning engine” and decision to treat the seed like a client reveal a coherent, obsessive designer mind. The embodied emotion is vivid when he “wiped his hands on a rag” while staring at the incubator, showing cost without label-speak. The final choice to weaponize the bloom for his attraction is earned by earlier lateral-thinking beats, so the flaw-to-payoff arc feels scaled to 700 words. One hairline slip: “he knew that true novelty often arrived in disguise” drifts toward epigram, but it is anchored to the envelope cue and immediately repaid by action.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s guilt-driven need to “macerate” silence into sound is viscerally embodied in the rope-burn palms and frantic pulls; his mournful eagerness is shown, not labeled, as he risks self-erosion to summon laughter. Interior contradiction is alive—he both craves and fears the roar—yet the emotional arc stays credible: fatigue → compulsion → brief absolution. The final renunciation (kneeling in petrol wind) pays the cost, though the daughter remains off-page, muting relationship-as-crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    The feral guardian’s contradictory impulses—predatory instinct vs. hunger for company—stay active in scene: the rumble that is “half-purr, half-growl” embodies the split. The final choice to sit, not pounce, is prepared by the earlier ache for “variable” contact, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority is concrete and bias-driven; the cultist tastes of “ozone and old paper,” a sensory hook that reveals the narrator’s alien appetite. No therapy-speak or label-summary flattens the peak beat, so the 9-gate is missed only because the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—stoic mask vs. weeping heart—is embodied in every beat: the gloved tremor, the “discipline” of crushing his own half-living lump, the final step-back that lets chaos erupt. His motivation escalates cleanly from heritage-rejection to self-annihilating catalyst; each failed approximation visibly sharpens the next. The “I must be the catastrophe” turn is earned because earlier attempts show him still sculpting order; the renunciation of control costs him literal skin to frost and the only relic of identity. Flaw (hopeless alchemist) directly drives the iterative mistakes that make the climax possible—no slips into diagnostic speak; emotion stays in muscle and metal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—grease on gloves, hairs lifted by the hush—and her micro-choice to “listen for the gaps” turns the beat. The nebula-transcription motive is stated early and loops back in closure, but the text never lets us feel a contradictory impulse; she never doubts or fears failure, so the cost feels intellectual rather than embodied. Still, the hierarchy of values (data > personal safety) is legible and consistent. Enough for a strong mid-7, but the absence of interior friction blocks 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s compulsive polishing of an already spectral ship crystallizes her stubborn professionalism in one vivid, embodied beat. The interior contradiction—cheerful diligence inside existential limbo—stays active in every micro-choice, cresting when she forces live time into the hourglass. Her refusal to surrender the deckhand role even after reality cracks charges the final image with credible cost: she wins back Tuesday mornings yet loses the cosmic vantage she briefly commanded. Voice and gesture never settle into occupational cliché; the ardor feels personal, not typed.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is rich—his fevered perception, the burn of the thread, the way memory liquefies under pressure—all feel singular and embodied. The “texture of connection” quest is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (threading, tying, sweating) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is alive: he both masters and is mastered by the dream he stitches. The final Earned Stasis—trapped inside the logic he wove—pays the cost of his earlier causal choices, though the emotional arc is slightly compressed by word-limit.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harlin’s interiority is concrete—tracing the chain link, calculating latitude by starlight—yet the emotional contradiction (exhilaration vs. abyssal confinement) stays active in-scene. The anchor chain reprise in the final beat crystallizes an Earned Stasis: he forecloses physical voyage while clutching the rusted iron, cost legible in the somber marvel. One flaw: “balancedly curious” is asserted, not dramatized as a trade-off; no moment shows curiosity tipping into recklessness or self-censor. Still, the micro-choice to log impossible coordinates anchors motivation to action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s stubborn curiosity and refusal to abandon a “case” the bureaucracy labels untraceable give her immediate, textured agency; the embodied dread and wonder she feels while slotting the hearing-aid anchor the contact-tracer premise in credible micro-choices. Interior contradiction (protocol vs. empathy) plays out in real time, and her final collapsed slump against the fountain shows a visible cost that closes her arc. The child-spirit remains off-page, so relationship pressure is one-sided, preventing the top band; still, her flaw-driven persistence fits the 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s dread of enclosed spaces is viscerally embodied early and recurs under rising pressure, grounding his choices. His vow to “stand by the unremembered” motivates every step, but the interior monologue stays general (“panic clawed,” “phobia weaponizing”) rather than revealing contradictory impulses in real time. No second character appears, so relationship/status dynamics are absent. The final ascent is driven by that same claustrophobic engine, showing credible endurance with cost, yet the arc flattens because we never glimpse a competing desire that might complicate the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory impulses—resurrection fantasy vs extraction realism—play out in every micro-choice; the heartbeat-count anchors Elias’s bureaucratic ghosthood while the ink-pour lets chaos override his own logic, all culminating in the earned renunciation “too late to save her, but just in time to save him.” Interiority stays concrete: throat-pulse, ink smell, shard edge. No therapy-speak, only sensory particularity. Cost is visible: the shard drowns, the file closes, the living pulse keeps ticking—an Earned Stasis that forecloses reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sylas is distinct in body and vocation, his copper-veined biology and storyteller function give immediate specificity, and his interiority (“a dry, silent rattle”) is concrete. Motivation is stable but hinges on a single abstract desire; we never glimpse competing impulses or private doubt, so the final smile feels foregone. Voice-loss is a visible cost, yet it’s external curse rather than flawed choice, so the renunciation is less “earned” than inflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s spite-driven mission is vivid and embodied; the arrowhead burn and blood smear make the cost tactile. Interiority stays specific—"curdled hope," "cosmic punchlines"—and the final floating laugh lands as earned change. The brother remains a prop, not a relationship crucible, so the +8.8 gate just misses.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s treasonous desire to “reawaken beauty” is stated early and embodied in the risky violin performance; her micro-choices (slowing pulse, bow synced to heartbeat) make the interior contradiction tangible. The locust shell object crystallizes her self-sacrificial ethos—she literally sacrifices it over the rail, foreclosing retreat. Emotion stays embodied (“chest heaving,” “coat billowing”) rather than diagnostic. Cost is visible: the city’s rupture is also her own exile from the order she knew, an earned stance that ends the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory tenderness toward the bottled storm and his self-exposed motive—“to find where broken promises heal”—give us a coherent interior. The micro-choice to murmur to the flask while sweat stings his eyes embodies the stakes under lethal surveillance. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV interior is specific, consistent, and drives every beat. The final renunciation (handing over the storm) is earned by prior causality and carries visible bodily cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s muteness is more label than crucible; the sudden song erupts without prior internal fracture shown. The “sealed lips” motive is asserted early but never tested in scene until the climax, so the reversal feels convenient rather than earned. Still, his tactile, work-focused interiority is concrete and consistent, and the final fusion moment does exact a visible cost (burnt palm, voice torn open), satisfying the Earned Stasis clause.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “sanely eccentric” logic is shown through her shelf-sorting by heartbreak gravity and her hyperbolic origami, but the piece withholds any interior contradiction or shifting micro-choice inside the portal beat; she remains composed before and after, so the cost is atmospheric, not felt on her body or psyche. The scarf slip lands as external mishap rather than character-driven failure, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory librarian-silence-curator role is vividly particular; her embodied urgency (“sweat prickling her skin”) and micro-choice to steal dawn-light to reify a dream show interior conflict in scene. The final renunciation—palette empty, weight gone—earns its emotional cost because her earlier strokes visibly depleted both light and longing. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps the relationship crucible bullet untested, capping just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Silas’s interiority stays oblique in a way that feels deliberate and vocation-true; the woman’s contradictory wish-to-hide / wish-to-sing is dramatized in her trembling grip and the centrifugal lurch that forces her hand open. The micro-choice to stare at the star while the ground dissolves is a crisp value-hierarchy test with immediate bodily cost, earning the later ribbon-striptease of her fear. Flaws (panic, decades of silence) actively complicate the beat rather than decorating it; competence (Silas) is balanced by the risk that his client might psychically shatter. One hairline slip: “tears welled in eyes that had seen too much caution” edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but the embodied vertigo immediately redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s obsession is viscerally embodied—soil under nails, feverish scan of wrecks—so we feel the chase. The stolen-voice wound is anchored in every beat, and the final hand-tremor on the mushroom sells the cost. Interiority avoids self-diagnosis; instead, “raw, open wound” is shown via the silent-movie memory he can’t hear. Yet the decades-long wait is told more than tested; we don’t see him almost quit or compromise, so the endurance feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s abrasive mentorship is vividly embodied—his backward walk, the sneer that masks approval, the stylus that feints reinforcement while secretly mapping escape. Lenore’s shift from shadow to solid is credible because every beat of her imprisonment has been calibrated to force self-reliance. The moment he plants his feet so she can see him stand ground crystallizes the crucible. Minor slip: “combative tenderness” is named rather than shown in the final beat, blunting cost by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elian’s interiority is poetically rendered, but his contradictory impulses remain abstract; the “insatiably creative” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices on the page. His final stance crystallizes as an Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels diffuse because no alternative path is foreclosed inside the scene. The characterization is vivid, but not yet tested under interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s guilt-driven precision and the tremor in his hands give embodied, contradictory emotion; the brother-spirit twist is foreshadowed by “same sea” and lands with felt cost. One micro-choice—threading the final silence—crystallizes renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only missed beat is a slightly abstract “unrest would never settle” summary at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “methodically curious” trait is dramatized through the forensic video comparison and the tactile, empathic press on the stone; the micro-choice to mimic grief rather than force the wall shows interior contradiction and embodied cost. The final beat—hand dripping rain as the spiral drops— crystallizes earned access and personal exposure, fulfilling the closure cost test. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; solo arc is coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is cerebral but embodied through tactile micro-choices (isolating panic threads, grounding the globe). The single contradiction—seeking detachment yet conversing with “Mort”—is kept performative rather than dramatized, so never quite bites. The final renunciation (letting the snow settle) is properly caused by his analytic intervention, paying visible cost in the dissipating vortex. Voice remains coherent, but the “physics of letting go” thesis is stated more than lived through bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s solitary grief and tinker-musician idiom stay vivid; every micro-movement (shaking the can, pressing the bolt plate) is a choice that costs him calm and risks electrocution. Interiority is sensorial—humming counter-melodies, tasting ozone—never abstract. Flaw: no second character on-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent; that caps the score at 8.7 per scope note.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s calmly intrusive devotion is consistently embodied—glove-adjust, cradle, tilt—every micro-gesture broadcasts a servant trained to tresure privacy yet cherish his dead master. The contradiction between elegiac tenderness and clinical detachment drives every beat and is paid for in the final image: he carries the “weight of the secret not as a burden,” a distilled Charged Poise that costs him continued silence. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; interiority remains singular, specific, and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s grief-stricken obsession is palpable, but his interiority slips into diagnostic label-speak (“Nimbus of Resentment”) that blunts embodied emotion. The final crystallization of purpose is earned by the telescopic sighting, yet his contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mourner) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices are few; most agency is observational, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. The voice remains consistent and individual, but the emotional arc is smoothed rather than scarred.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s face-blindness is more than a label: it dictates why he alone stays behind, how he “sees” the coin’s ridges instead of a monarch, and why touch, not sight, unlocks the sky. The contradiction—an artist who cannot recognize faces—drives every micro-choice and gives the ending its cost: he can paint infinity but can’t preserve himself inside it. Interiority stays concrete (“topography of ridges, pores, and shadows”) and avoids diagnostic cliché. The only slack is the absence of a second on-page character, so status/relationship crucible bullets are moot but not missed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is never a label; it drives every micro-choice (leaning over the rail, kneeling in dust, aligning page to floor). Interiority stays concrete—wind-chapped cheeks, ink-stained cuffs—without stock phrasing. The final stance crystallization—private audience with the universe—pays the cost of permanent solitude. No contradiction under pressure; only the missing on-page flaw (no genuine mistake) keeps her short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is sensuous and specific—“shivering not from the cold, but from the weight of her title”—and every micro-choice (blind walk across the mirrors, solvent drip, torque on the wrench) externalizes her hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she packs her tools to the “gentle clinking of metal sounding like a lullaby,” a quiet exhaustion that forecloses further pursuit. Competence is balanced by genuine struggle, but the absence of a second character means status dynamics and relationship crucible bullets are N/A; the score reflects solo-interior excellence only.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—hope laced with fatalism—surfaces in her calloused hand gripping the bell and the chalk dust on her boots; Jaxon’s grudging curiosity is embodied in a single grease-stained tap. The collective “family” remains a chorus rather than individuated voices, but the visible cost (bloody thorns, groaning anchors) scales to length and the final earned stasis under the mended sky lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s solitary, esoteric mission is rendered through tactile micro-choices—thumb on porcelain crack, forehead against pane—so the interior contradiction between cosmic duty and child-sized tenderness is embodied, not declared. The beautifully flawed puppet head literalizes his own cracked humanity, and his willingness to dissolve with it earns a credible renunciation. No second character appears, so relational crucible is N/A; the pressure is all self-generated and sustains voice. The only limit keeping this from 9+ is that the interiority, while vivid, remains relentlessly lyric and could use one more specific, grounded memory to make the lullaby feel personally earned rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s interiority is terse and embodied—every beat is filtered through his arthritic contempt for the orchard and the salt burn on his cheeks. His “sloppy precision” gait is shown only once, but it cleanly externalizes the tension between reluctance and mastery. The cost is palpable: the nut’s telekinetic harvest leaves him “drained and trembling,” a price tied to the rescue that earned him the moment of perfect, exhausted silence. Yet we get no glimpse of what guiding strangers actually means to him beyond the label, so the emotional arc crests at competence, not contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—thirty-year obsession with unbreakable plastics vs. new hunger for self-undoing polymer—are kept in simultaneous play; the crushed chrysalis dusting into the ravine is a micro-choice that visibly pays the cost of renunciation. Interiority stays concrete and music-inflected rather than diagnostic. The only bar to 9+ is that the late insight arrives as pure cognition; we don’t feel the body under time pressure while he thinks.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s obsessive search for “point zero” is dramatized through the tactile ritual of erasure: weighing void-glass, incising timelines, pouring moonlight. Each micro-choice (scalpel angle, scale calibration) externalizes his interior contradiction—he profits from oblivion yet despises stories that end. The velvet-wipe of his hands after the demo crystallizes a man who treats memory as ore to be refined, not mourned. Cost is visible: every successful parole leaves a spectral shimmer that guarantees innocence is only rented, not owned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is sensorially embodied and paradox-laden (“taste of betrayal and cold abandonment”), her micro-choice to place frozen coral on tongue crystallizes the arc, and the cost—metabolic agony that lifts the fortress pall—is legible. The sole flaw: the “sandpaper rough memories” line drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting full 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—she “understood the terror the machines felt” yet “could not permit their fear to starve the populace,” a tight contradiction that powers her climb. The embodied cost is visible: “she sweated in the cold air, her muscles trembling” while manually pushing the brass wheel. One flaw: the “empathetically decisive” label is announced rather than dramatized in an early micro-choice, slightly blunting the arc’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ruthless self-experimentation vs. reverence for the obsolete—remains vivid and embodied; the synaptic burn is felt in her rigid spine. The “archeologist of abandoned dreams” motive is declared early and drives every micro-choice (fusing wires to cracked glass, clamping probes to temples). No second character appears, so status crucible is N/A; her only relationship is with the human race that is discarding itself, and that abstraction stays concrete through tactile artifact work. The final Earned Stasis—she is now a living library—carries visible somatic cost (trembling hands, seismic shudder) and is foreclosed by the prior causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s prism-mind fractures every beat into tactical multiplicity; the twelve simultaneous trajectories she weighs while “surfing the seams of reality” make her cognition the engine of every move. Interiority is concrete—“the impact jarred her teeth but left her triumphant” couples pain with payoff. The only flaw: we are told she once found the sanctum “too dull to grasp,” yet that past failure never complicates present choices, so the implied contradiction stays latent rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s obsession with resurrecting sound in a mute world is vividly embodied through tactile micro-choices—waiting for the hedgehog, tracing scream lines, swaying with the alder—showing a man bending his body to the grain of silence. The interior contradiction is present but thin: we feel his patience, yet never taste the doubt that he might be wrong; the failure-scarred block lectures him, yet he never questions his own worth or sanity. The final kneel and weep lands as believable release because the prose has made silence a bodily weight, but the arc stops just shy of a second impulse that would complicate his triumph. Still, within 750 words the characterization is specific, consistent, and tied to the closure image—strong enough for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s exile-grief and grandmaster patience are viscerally embodied in the stone-thumbing and ridge-watching; the sacrificial self-reckoning (“I am the sacrificed piece”) crystallizes a believable inner turn. Interiority avoids label-speak and shows contradictory impulses—yearning for beauty while nursing twenty-year resentment—under the magnetic chill. Micro-choices (adjusting collar, mapping silence, renouncing return) align with chess-tutor precision and scale cost to length. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets not applicable; single-POV depth is strong but not earth-shakingly revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s pacifism and “empathic locksmith” persona are vividly particular—his velvet motley coat, tuning-fork diplomacy, and refusal to “force a secret” all manifest in embodied action. Interiority stays concrete: “sorrow rots if it is not allowed to breathe” is spoken aloud, not summarized. The micro-choice to bow to the diary before touching it crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him time while the city counts down to fireworks, a visible price. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, however; the arc is a smooth ascent of competence rather than a struggle with flaw, capping this just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive to ‘anchor serenity within motion’ is concrete via her seed-tending micro-choices and final revision of that goal; still, we never see her risk failure or real trade-off, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s drive to cure the blight is clear and personal, but her interiority stays largely functional—"intrepid orchard pilot" is declared, not dramatized. The moment she grips the arrow tip shows a micro-choice with cost, yet we get no contradictory impulse or visible flaw that would complicate the decision. Competence is foregrounded; genuine struggle or internal contradiction is muted, keeping the arc competent rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s calm, methodical interiority is consistent and profession-sharp; the scorched patch moment forces a flash of empathy that complicates her detachment. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the “earned cost” is more conceptual than embodied, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception, gloved hands, phantom arm-ache—yet his “certify wonder” motive is declared rather than dramatized. The endurance of solitude is embodied, but no contradictory impulse is tested; the choice to pull the rope feels predetermined. Micro-choices (scanning ice, smoothing amber sheet) show hierarchy of values, but the absence of a visible cost or renunciation keeps the arc shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s guilt-driven compulsion is vivid—his trembling fingers, the tear-streaked face—but the interior contradiction between duty and self-forgiveness is told more than dramatized in the moment. The final insight is earned by the prior failure recalled on-page, so the arc lands, yet we never feel him tempted to reverse course; the choice is already made before the scene begins, muting live tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Operator’s personality-shifting is dramatized through embodied posture snaps and inkless fingers, giving us a living contradiction on the page. Kael’s micro-choices—white knuckles on chair arms, the swallowed scream—embody escalating fear without label-speak. The cost is visible: Kael slumped “empty and hollowed,” Operator “vibrant,” a zero-sum transfusion that forecloses Kael’s future. Interiority stays strictly bounded to perception; no knowledge leaks, but the borrowed-personality trait never complicates the Operator’s own tactics—he remains omnipotent observer—so the arc flirts with safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s ever-present physical jitters are made legible through tactile micro-choices—strap-adjusting, chain-clutching, humming—so the final quieting of her body after the magic discharge feels earned. Interiority is specific (“monochrome stupor”) and her motivation germinates wonder rather than simple courier duty. The loss of Kaelen is more backstory premise than active relational pressure, so the character arc pivots on self-reliance rather than crucible dynamics; still, her value hierarchy (risk life to seed wonder) shows visible cost. Moment of stance crystallization at the summit carries a felt bodily price and qualifies as Earned Stasis, satisfying the closure quick-test.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rationalist grounded in mud yet hungering for ethereal proof—stays alive in every beat; his micro-choice to press the prism to frost, not merely look at it, embodies the stakes. Mara’s shift from cold skepticism to tearful recognition is credible because the story lets her body speak first (shiver, whisper, hot tear) before the insight. The “truthful lies” stance is performed, not declared: Elias offers refraction, not resurrection, and that restraint keeps mystic-attentive label from slipping into cliché. Only lack of deeper flaw or jeopardy for Elias keeps this shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s longing to reach “another soul” is visceral, embodied in the tremor of her fingers and the amber bead she risks everything for. The sacrifice is foreshadowed early—her body already “curved like a question mark”—so her final dissolution feels earned rather than convenient. Interior contradiction is present: she both clings to memory and feeds it to the void. The only thing missing is a second micro-choice that would show her hierarchy of values under even sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ewan’s meek-to-resolute arc is embodied in the slow boot-placement beat and soot-wipe; the interior contradiction (terrified yet resolved) stays alive in scene. The final renunciation—returning to the forge without acclaim—pays off the quiet-determination trait with visible social cost. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible waived; micro-choices (descending, bartering, climbing) reveal value hierarchy. Backstory is minimal, anchored to present stimuli; flaw (meekness) complicates the heroic descent and is not tidily erased.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s sensory-mapping gift is viscerally embodied—her trance-choices to fight the temporal current and redirect the vision are micro-acts that cost blood and breath. The withheld-truth drive stays urgent; her final refusal to share what she learns feels like earned stasis with weight pressing on her sternum. Flaw: interiority drifts into abstract “crushing burden” rather than a final, concrete bodily cost; that keeps her from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait are shown through concrete micro-choices—slow climb, cataloging tremor, selecting sea-glass—and the final gesture balances both motives. Thomas’s unraveling is viscerally embodied; his loosening posture after the glow lands is credible. The internal contradiction (silence vs. need to intervene) is present but soft; Elias’s stoic coat never truly threatens his intervention, so the cost feels donated rather than wrested. Still, the single-scene crucible and visible endurance yield a clean Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    Silas’s manic, prophetic persona is vivid, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain performative rather than felt; his laughter and “shadowed elation” are declared, not dramatized through body or sensory cue. No internal conflict or micro-choice visibly alters tactics once the ritual starts—he simply keeps laughing and turning mirrors. The accidental prophecy trait is stated, never leveraged to force a decision or reveal a blind spot. Earned cost is missing; the storm obeys without resistance or price, so the closure image feels imposed rather than personally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete, dye-master craft shapes every beat; the donor-heart as wild-animal metaphor is embodied, not label-speak. Micro-choice of aligning sun and wing shows hierarchy of values. Only nit: six-month transplant adjustment is asserted, not dramatized—cost is felt but could bite harder.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s curiosity about trees is stated early but never friction-tested; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice complicates it under pressure, so the final hand-to-bark beat feels pre-decided. The “burning curiosity” is rehearsed rather than embodied in scene-level risk. Meets baseline interiority but lacks the earned contradiction required for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s memory-shattered interiority is vivid—her mind literally frays under the loom-work, a lived cost. The single POV stays anchored in her body (burnt palms, heaving chest) and her final collapse is a credible renunciation. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only narrated, so the micro-turn feels one-note; still, the chord is consistent and the price is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—empathy as “language to be read” is a sharp reversal of pathology. The paradox-driven self-erasure beat (staying while leaving) embodies contradictory impulses in-scene. Cost is felt: the “heavy and comforting blanket” of silence replaces the abrasive world, a trade-off earned by lifelong retreat. Only the tiniest drift toward therapeutic self-labeling (“burdensome attribute”) keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias's interior contradiction—guilt for surviving vs. need to keep memory alive—is dramatized through the tactile care he gives each seed and the bread ritual; the micro-choice to slice and taste the vanished loaf visibly costs him calm, earning the renunciation. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in the brass dial turn and steady hands under time pressure, but interiority stays safe—no contradictory impulse or blind spot is dramatized. The final ledger stamp registers duty satisfied, yet the cost feels procedural rather than personal; we see no foreclosed path inside her. Still, the micro-choice chain is coherent and character-specific enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her itch-feint, the vial palmed like a pulse—but the “curiously steadfast” tag is asserted more than dramatized; still, her micro-choices under silence build a credible hierarchy of values and the final cost (trapping betrayal while forfeiting the fob) is legible, so the arc earns its renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s skepticism is embodied in every micro-choice: she tastes the air to stay oriented, clutches the toy compass, and recoils from metaphysical rhetoric long before the final inversion. The internal contradiction—glowing skin, analytical mind—drives every beat and crystallizes when she accepts the cloud forming above her own palms. Cost is not declared; it is lit: her bioluminescence dims as the sky claims her. One hairline slip: “luminous skeptic” is named once in narration rather than shown through fresh behavior in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s grief-anchored, eidetic memory and charcoal-stained hands ground every micro-choice; the violent shattering of the lock externalizes a believable flaw-to-act progression. Interiority stays concrete—”visceral rasp” of charcoal, “spectral, burning definition” of quartz-light—without diagnostic speak. The final renunciation (burying the lock behind the portrait) carries visible cost: he forfeits the surface-world safety he fled. The only minor gap: we never see him actually doubt the ritual; the descent feels pre-decided, so the beat is more catharsis than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s vocation & lie-allergy give her body-level stakes, but her interiority never contradicts itself under pressure; the moment she touches the plate her decision is already set, so the “change” feels announced rather than wrestled out. The clerk’s switch from denial to complicity is credible because her visible collapse makes the cost of his lie immediate. No secondary character pressure beyond that single beat. Overall, a strong crucible but short of the micro-choices that would lift it to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s mute winter and bell-tuner identity are vivid, embodied, and directly shape her desperate, tactile act; the absence of voiced speech forces her entire climax to be channeled through raw physics, giving her interior contradiction and earned cost a visceral register. Micro-choices—tightening cables in the wind, pressing her bones to the vibrating brass—reveal her hierarchy of values inside the single beat. No secondary character on page, so no relationship crucible, but the solo arc lands as credible renunciation: she spends her only iceberg, her one chance to feel, knowing the silence will return. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and her flaw (individual audacity in a consensus world) drives the irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction—nostalgia vs survival protocol—is dramatized through the chest-plate opening and cable insertion; the final “quiet, unified soul” is earned by the catastrophic burn. Embodiment is vivid (“his internal fans screaming”), but the children remain off-page abstractions, so the familial ache is filtered through summary rather than micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “sandstorm calm” is vividly embodied and her listening method is dramatized through micro-choices, but the shift from curator label to community savior is too frictionless—no interior contradiction or cost is shown to make the victory feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—poetic algorithmic thinking, embodied fear masked as choreography, the dice as totems of risk—contradictory impulses (terror vs. lyrical control) act together in the dance-password beat. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: surrender to system logic > personal survival > filial elegy. The final pocketing of dice/journal shows earned stasis with visible cost: she leaves lighter yet carries the oceanic weight. Only mild safety-hedge: her competence edges on too-full mastery, muting flaw fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s terror, superstition, and single-minded need to anchor himself to a lost summer are shown through bodily detail (trembling hand, racing heart) and a credible micro-choice—clutching the crystal and flowers as psychic ballast. The interior contradiction between terror and practiced grace is dramatized, not narrated. Memory as consumable waste product is a fresh, character-specific obsession that charges every shovel of salt. The final “he had reclaimed his ghost” lands as earned renunciation because the dig and the gravity-flux cost have been physically paid.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s lone-mage profile is vividly sketched through bodily ritual and a single, high-stakes micro-choice—dropping the wing. The lack of any contradictory impulse keeps him just shy of the 9+ gate; we see no moment where he doubts or where the cost of his solitude bites. Still, his sensory-biased attention and the quiet, earned stasis at the end make the characterization resonant and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s shift from curiosity to survival-level complicity is embodied in the moment he takes the seal and asks for tea; Elara’s “patiently nimble” fingers and calm rhetoric show a consistent, eerie competence. Interior contradiction is present—“I am done” yet he sits to drink—and the micro-choice to endorse the lie carries visible ethical cost. The relationship crucible works: her status as keeper of the lie forces his capitulation. Only the absence of a deeper backstory for Elara keeps this shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “charmed skeptic” interiority is vivid—she stroked the velvet moss while calculating impossible physics—but the diagnostic self-tag “ghostly resolve” momentarily abstracts her state. Micro-choices (humming dissonance, pressing shell to field) align with motive; the tears and empty-gaze ending embody cost. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped; solo arc earns credible renunciation with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elian’s interiority is surgical: the memory of the queen’s eyes is a concrete spur, the thorn-in-hand a micro-choice that literalizes self-lacerating guilt. His heartbeat synchronized to stone drips embodies the “wisely enduring” trait with visceral cost. The single-letter forgery is a believable apex of a lifetime spent inside ink and parchment; competence and cowardice coexist without safety-hedging. A hairline slip: “precision required a stillness that bordered on the grave” drifts toward abstract maxim, but the next sentence re-anchors to bodily chill.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s sensory-specific vocation is shown through acoustic micro-choices (“adjusted her pitch… catching dissonance”), but her interior contradiction—the cold drive to expose murder versus the trembling isolation of the act—stays summary-level until the final breath. The shell-handling gives tactile stakes; her body never visibly trembles or mis-sings under stress, so embodied cost arrives late. Closure choice (seal the echo) is causally prepared by every prior sung fragment, earning the renunciation of silence, yet the moment of private terror that should foreshadow it is only asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; her micro-choice to risk the spirit by “synchronizing the dream cameos” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The embodied contradiction—clutching a heat-warped globe inside a glacier shrine—makes her obsession tactile. One minor slip: “singular and unyielding” motivation is told, not shown, just before the final beat. Still, the renunciation of grief lands with cost: the shrine’s air lightens, foreclosing her habitual nightly communion.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s philosopher-net-mender fusion is vivid—his act of whisking tea to “seek the core concept” embodies both trades in one motion. Interiority stays concrete: the hole-in-net metaphor anchors worldview, later re-echoed in the firefly sphere. The final whistle is a micro-choice that costs him his solitary witness stance, earning a quiet renunciation. Flaw: no contradictory impulse on-page; he moves from observation to action without visible internal friction, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s rational-obsessive identity is cleanly signaled and stays consistent; his tweezers-and-dust patience embodies the debunker ethos under lethal pressure. The leap from data to gut-frequency tuning shows a credible fracture in his certainty, paid for by the orchard’s survival. Interiority stays concrete—“watched the diamond wobble”—never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation—expose the truth, end the sanctuary—carries visible moral cost that scales to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s obsessive solitude and god-complex are vividly rendered through tactile micro-choices (adjusting loupes, turning dials). The final slump into the chair embodies the cost of his miscalculation. Yet Kael remains off-stage, so the crucial relationship that fractures is only reported, muting the emotional crucible and keeping the arc just short of full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interior contradiction between scavenger-pragmatist and elegiac archivist is vivid; every micro-choice (uncorking lullaby, tilting rain) embodies the stakes. Emotion is never labeled—"swelling in his chest" is the closest we get, and it lands because the body has been handling glass and rust. The final renunciation—sealing the jars again—forecloses the path of sharing the loft, and the tremor in his hands is enough cost. Voice specificity slips once: “a chemist” feels like an outside comparison rather than Elian’s own idiom, keeping it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “logically emotional” label is dramatized at the climax: he catalogs fear, then strips gloves and vocalizes—an embodied micro-choice that fuses intellect and instinct. The contradictory impulse (precision vs. surrender to sound) drives the decisive turn; the cost—bare skin freezing on iron—makes the renunciation visible. Interiority stays concrete (“the key ceased to be a solid object and became a waveform”), avoiding diagnostic speak. A hairline slip: “he understood that the terror gripping his gut was merely a biological response” drifts toward explanation; tightened, this would clear 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—“she counted the degrees of arc under her breath”—and her contradictory impulse to wait while Kael burns to act is dramatized in the same beat. The final renunciation of noise for silence costs Kael’s former certainty, visible in his “new, terrified reverence.” Minor slip: Kael’s trembling hands are a stock tell; a single sensory detail (cold-reddened knuckles versus furnace-heat inside his palms) would have lifted this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory pull between bureaucratic survival and empathic openness is dramatized in concrete micro-choices—scanning the mud, touching the lantern, uploading the report while hands shake. The final refusal costs him career security; that stakes jump is earned by the prior beats where we see the lantern-induced overload threaten his own nervous system. Interiority stays specific to his investigator lens (“tasting copper and ozone”) rather than diagnostic labels. The only minor slack is that Halloway’s antagonism is off-page voice, so his status shift is asserted not witnessed, but the embodied cost on him is still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s guilt and need to “prove that even the most broken things could function” give him a clear, active stake. His interiority stays concrete—watching “his hope wither,” the “stone in his gut”—but the repair-woman’s motives remain opaque, so relationship pressure is only half-felt. The ending’s renunciation lands cleanly: he stands paralyzed by the grace he withheld—cost visible, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The yearning algorithm is a crisp, externalized motive that escalates with every brass-drum notch; the obsessive stripping of armor for speed shows a believable mechanical “flaw” feeding ascent cost. The kaleidoscope POV gives concrete, character-specific perception instead of abstract “wants.” Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where the algorithm’s command conflicts with a counter-impulse on-page—so the final ding feels inevitable rather than wrestled. Still, the single-POV endurance is legible and the cost (fragile chime tap in lethal altitude) is visible, satisfying the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas’s obsession with the deleted-crew mystery is vivid and embodied (the thumb-rubbed patch), but interiority flirts with label-speak (“his motivation was singular”) and the final horror is more declared than lived in his body. The contradiction between corporate cheer and private desperation is present yet never forces a micro-choice that visibly costs him until the final image, which lands as revelation rather than irreversible decision. Still, the fraying patch as tactile anchor and the lie to the drone show credible tactic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation—mapping empathy into a shield—remains singular and intensifies through the metaphysical search; the crystal shard literally becomes that shield. Interiority stays concrete (“shadows on his arms pulse”) rather than abstract. The final gesture of laying the glowing shard on the table externalizes contradiction (mercy vs. annihilation) with visible cost, earning the shift from entropy to stillness. Only drawback: the council remains a monolith, so status dynamics are implied not tested, capping highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—gloved hands sifting ice, marrow pain, the parasol tip’s cold bite against his chest. The contradiction between suicidal intent and the compulsive deferral of the act is visible in micro-choices: volunteering, pocketing the useless silver shard. The final renunciation (ready now to die) is earned by the parasol tip’s sensory proof that fragility outlasts violence, paying the cost of curiosity. Only the “grips reality loosely” label risks diagnostic-speak, but it is tethered to repeated sensory dissociation, so the flaw is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s “nurture intersubjective understanding” motive is stated rather than embodied; the vineyard metaphor speech feels diagnostically neat for a midnight stranger encounter. Interiority is sparse—one bark-rough kindness line stands out, but most emotion is gestural (tightened grip, swollen eyes). The woman’s shift from bitterness to wonder is credible because the metaphor does the heavy lifting, yet her final refusal to chase the ash is under-motivated: we see release, not the internal hinge that makes it possible.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s fear of emptiness (“tomorrow will be empty”) is a raw, embodied confession that crystallizes his interior stakes; the ceramic mask, peripheral navigation, and ritual gestures all align with this dread. Yet the story never tests that terror with a live failure or temptation—he succeeds too smoothly—so the promised flaw/compulsion stays theoretical. The Earned Stasis at the end (knowledge sealed, path foreclosed) is credible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Still, within 740 words, the hierarchy of values is legible: truth > personal safety > public recognition, and the contradiction between masked bravado and naked confession is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s calm, patient stance is shown through embodied waiting and the physical bridge he becomes; the interior contradiction between decay and repair is vivid. However, the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page, and the final renunciation, while earned, is slightly under-costed—no tangible loss beyond spent time is felt. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the micro-choice to hold the photo for hours dramatizes values hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The interior contradiction—fear of speech vs compulsion to testify—is dramatized through the crystal’s resistance against his lips and the rasp of the first whisper. The micro-choice to fracture syntax is embodied, not declared, and the final shedding of fear is legible in the widening eyes and lowered crystal. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. The cost is present but compressed; a hair more physical fallout (tremor lingering, throat raw) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s precognitive-amnesia is dramatized through tactile ritual (chalk, driftwood) that externalizes memory; the interior contradiction between seer and amnesiac is felt in every beat. His final choice—sitting down to listen to magnetic decay—renounces future-certainty for sensory present, paying the cost of forgotten prophecy. The trait drives every micro-action; no stock “junkyard prophet” shorthand appears. Voice stays ragged, specific, embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is sensor-rich and profession-specific; the grief for irreversible time is embodied in the spinning hand against his chest. Contradictory impulse—letting the hand flee vs caging its speed—drives every micro-turn. The final renunciation (he shelters the camera with his body while releasing the shutter) is earned by the acoustic trial sequence and carries visible cost. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; ache stays metallic and auditory.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s vocation is lived in the body: the low hum that marries oxygen hiss to cello resonance, the decisive yet tender pry of the shard from Clara’s hand. His interiority—serenity as discipline, terror at being the final ear—remains specific and unromanticized; “decisively kind” is enacted, not labeled. Every micro-choice (bow grip adjustment, synchronizing his pulse to hers) externalizes his hierarchy of values: her safe passage over his own composure. Closure shows earned renunciation: he finishes the phrase, her breathing stops, cost stays in his numb fingers and the sudden antiseptic return—an irreversible forfeiture paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s quietly deliberate persona is embodied through precise micro-choices (kneeling, aligning tumblers, adjusting the governor valve) and her fear of the machine tearing itself apart momentarily threatens her composure—yet these flashes feel external, not internal contradiction. The interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, but lacks a second, clashing impulse that would push her to a visible cost or renunciation; the ending’s knowledge-loss functions as an external reset rather than a character-driven sacrifice. Motivation remains clear and escalates with the stakes of rewriting the sky, yet the absence of a palpable trade-off on her person caps the arc below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thorne’s interior contradiction—scientist confronting the impossible—drives every beat; the shift from clinical removal to yearning for the magic is embodied in the tactile tooth and the decision to “reset” grief. The micro-choice to bypass the stethoscope for bone-setting tools crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is visible: he risks professional credibility and emotional safety to offer parents a navigable lie. Minor slip: “shrewdly innocent” is applied to the fae, not self-diagnosed, so the trait feels attributed rather than enacted by him.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for stars while grounded by fire-trauma—drives every beat; her tremor when the wheel triggers the inferno memory is visceral, and her micro-choice to inhale and keep polishing embodies the “pearl of stillness” she seeks. The lack of a second on-page character keeps status and relational crucible off the table, but her solitary stance crystallizes into Earned Stasis: she finishes the gem, foreclosing fire-light forever. The only minor slack is a slight over-articulation of motive (“she could not forget…”) when the sensory flashback already shows it.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s quietly proactive gardening of the ruins and his wordless offering of the pendant externalize his interior motive to “graft new meaning onto old wounds,” embodying the trait instead of labeling it. Mara’s guarded trembling and silent acceptance of the amber show fully embodied, contradictory emotion—terror and tentative trust—without diagnostic language. Their mutual silence under the honeyed hush is a credible Earned Stasis that costs them the safety of speech yet re-opens the possibility of life; the pendant is both literal talisman and micro-choice that crystallizes the shift. No interior drift into therapy-speak; every beat is filtered through tactile attention to moss, water, and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—creator vs. destroyer of hope—are dramatized in the shell extraction beat: he bows in apology while still stealing. Interiority stays concrete (“chest heaving,” “lucidly watchful”), avoids diagnostic speak. The renunciation of changing the text but still paying cost gives a visible, scaled endurance. Micro-choices (bow, whisper, step back) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Missing 9.0 because the theft ritual is only one beat; no secondary character crucible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s single-minded drive is vivid—his trembling fingers, the remembered bread-kneading songs—but we never feel a contradictory impulse that might complicate or endanger his quest. The interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted; no moment shows him doubting the ritual or weighing personal loss, so the “cost” is borne by the vine, not his psyche. The earned smile at the end feels gentle rather than freighted. Still, the embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are compelling for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is richly embodied—he “kneels without a shudder,” letting frost bite through coat wool—showing stoic discipline that fuses motive to body. Flash-paper alchemy as vocation is particularized through ritual micro-choices (etching the copper, waiting for pulse-sync) rather than label-only exposition. Patience and sorrow-rooted obsession steer every beat, culminating in Earned Stasis: he carries the orchard’s heartbeat away, forever unable to revive the original forest. One flaw: no contradictory impulse; he is monolithic resolve, so change is external rather than internal contradiction faced—cost is felt, but character remains flatly heroic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rational locksmith who hoards wonder—is on-page and embodied, but the micro-choices that dramatize the cost (hand tremor, breath mist) are generic and repeat rather than sharpen. The final renunciation carries felt weight because the cavern’s silence is rendered as a physical loss, yet the “cellar of reason” motive is asserted more than tested; we never see him resist an urge to open the box. Interiority stays coherent, but the absence of a second character or status crucible keeps relational pressure—and thus flaw consequences—latent. Earned endurance lands, but the lack of a visible tactical mistake cap keeps the arc just below the 7+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—“boundary-lessly trapped” is dramatized through the fractal weave tightening around her lungs—but the single on-page choice (aligning the burner) is slightly under-motivated; we feel her crushing duty yet never see the specific villager or memory that makes this regret uniquely hers. The cost is present—she exhales frost and pockets stones—but the emotional ledger stays abstract; a hairline slip from 9-band. Micro-choices are vivid (twisting wrist, closing one eye) and contradict nothing; competence balanced with visible strain.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s practical grief is viscerally embodied; the ash block becomes an extension of her spine. Interior contradiction—she craves relief yet refuses sentiment—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (letting the wood hold the ghost) is earned by the prior tactile ritual; cost is felt in the kettle’s scream and her measured sip. Only marginal: the “hauntingly practical” tag is repeated rather than revealed through fresh contradiction at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jaren’s interior contradiction—once driven to restart the Carousel, now seeking only the stillness’s center—grounds every micro-choice; the camera-wheel clicks embody his tactile obsession. His embodied regret (“hot and suffocating”) arrives after the ghost’s forehead touch, so the emotional cost is legible and earned. The “wrench into the primary gear” memory crystallizes flaw-driven causality, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only minor hedging: the chronological confusion trait is asserted more than dramatized in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s curiosity and engineering mindset are credibly rendered; his interiority is specific (“dormant potential,” “diverted currents”).  The final beat – quietly noting luminosity values after the hologram blooms – crystallizes his stoic, calculation-over-celebration nature, earning the change.  No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the cost (risking the improvised lens) is only implicit; hence not quite 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—thirty years of self-imposed silence against the ache for sound—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (hovering quill, knees on wet quartz, trembling fingertip). The renunciation of the luthier dream is earned by the rain-triggered sensory rupture and the final “bear it” stance, paid for with visible tears and the decision to leave his ghost behind. No head-count or status issues; single POV stays coherent. Voice remains hushed yet idiosyncratic, avoiding diagnostic label-speak even at the emotional crest.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular—his hatred of myths, the “nausea” once the trick is seen—yet every beat is filtered through the same lyric register; no contradictory impulse ever threatens his calm. The pocket-sundial test is a crisp micro-choice, but it is the only one; the rest is rapt observation. The renunciation at the end (lowering the evidence) carries cost, but it is staged more as elegy than as character-forcing decision. Still, the voice-bound consistency keeps him legible and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied—his “ghost-like gentleness” with the rope shows vocation as reflex. Interiority is specific to his diviner’s lens, never drifting into label-speak. The only flaw is the absence of any visible cost to him; the story ends with gain, not forfeiture, so renunciation feels mild rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s solitary vocation is embodied in every beat—his “projection” is a micro-choice that costs him emotional exposure. The Countess’s finger-twisting of the carpet thread externalizes grief under pressure and forecloses her prior denial. Their shared silence is a crucible that alters both states: she moves from void-language to acceptance, he from observer to complicit presence. Cost is visible: his page is still wet, her finger white from tourniquet thread.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Valerius’s near-mad drive to resurrect beauty in a dead world is viscerally embodied from the first line, his tattered velvet coat a lived-in shorthand that never feels labeled. His interiority—“external vibration exceeds three hertz”—retains the prince’s diction while exposing the contradiction between his faith in metrics and the abyss he courts. The final moment where he cups the dying bird is a silent Earned Stasis: causality, cost, and contradiction all collapse into one gesture, leaving us certain this path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory drives—atonement through firefighting artistry, fear of repeating her father’s joy in destruction—are dramatized in the meticulous grafting ritual; her micro-choice to submerge the coin-tied branch visibly stakes her identity on the outcome. The moment her held breath releases as the branch hums, we feel both cost and earned shift. Yet the father is only summarized, so the relational crucible is off-stage; interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract penance rather than embodied sensation. Still, the final stance crystallizes with palpable weight, satisfying the 9- gate for contradiction plus renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is dramatized in every move—she treats her own glow as “diagnostic leaks,” never awe. The single micro-choice, waiting motionless until the star strikes, crystallizes her mechanistic faith and costs her hours of stillness. No interior contradiction is voiced, so the arc is linear not knotted, but the embodied cold light + tool-using intellect combo feels singular. Closure is an earned stasis: she concedes magic is real yet retains identity as mechanic—cost is the unending maintenance burden she now shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Xylos’s grief-soaked interiority is vivid and embodied; the brass gear as “parent heart” is a charged micro-choice that tilts every beat. The final loneliness lands as a credible cost because his earlier sentimental acts (naming stars, weeping at atoms) have been established as reflex, now rendered obsolete. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously in scene—sentimentality is confessed rather than enacted under pressure—so the arc is more monologue than crucible. Still, the renunciation feels earned because the gear-fit is visibly imperfect and the silence after turning carries palpable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for geometric grief yet forced to trace chaotic moth-flight—collide in embodied action on the ladder; the trembling silk against condensation makes his interior contradiction tactile. His flaw (perfectionist carver) directly spawns the climactic micro-choice: to carve the messy knot instead of the expected circle, paying the visible cost of abandoning his life-long aesthetic code. Ghost-grandfather’s pressure supplies secondary stakes; the spectral hand on Elias’s fingers crystallizes status shift and forces the irreversible stroke of the mallet. All beats are character-bound; no diagnostic label-speak; the final endurance reads as earned renunciation with felt occupational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Silas’s priestly obsession with temporal purity is viscerally embodied—his “anxious handling” of the rake handle engrained with his own trespasses—so every micro-choice (risking his fingers inside the swing) is a credibly costly penance. Contradictory impulses (duty to the town vs. need for personal absolution) collide inside the single beat of adjustment, the interior conflict driving the external action without any diagnostic self-talk. The incremental erosion of the handle’s inscriptions literalizes interior change on the page; the visible cost (dark burn on the wood) anchors the arc. No secondary characters appear, so relational bullets are N/A; single-POV baseline is exceeded.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s cheery whistling against velvet gloom is a vivid contradiction, but his motives stay externalized; we see toolkit curiosity, no interior contradiction or cost. The “blithe” stance risks flattening into quirk because no micro-choice on the page is punished or forced. The waiting payoff is legible, yet the emotional turn is narrated rather than embodied; no felt cost hits Silas, so the closure is observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—duty to lie truthfully vs. fear of the darkness he maps—drives every beat; the final micro-choice (ink hits vellum) costs him the right to doubt, a price felt in the trembling quill. Embodied emotion is sharp (“thin air… crystalline degree”), never label-speak. One flaw: we get no secondary pressure from an on-page human foil, so status dynamics remain theoretical; still, the self-as-antagonist crucible is fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s quiet, precise surrender of the violet-glow page to darkness crystallizes a hierarchy of values—story over safety—without a single overt declaration; the dust-as-virus concept externalizes his interior contradiction between obedience and heresy. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial (“thistled calm,” “rough-spun coat”) rather than diagnostic. The only keep-away-from-9 element is the off-stage ingestion payoff; we infer but do not witness the cost inside another body, so the final renunciation’s cost lands mostly on him, satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—gentle truth-teller vs ritual destroyer—surface in every micro-choice; the final obliteration is earned by the prior tender withholdings, and the cost (her scream, his silence) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s rational-rebel persona is vividly embodied—lecturing rats, measuring decay, filing burrs until his fingers bleed. Interiority is concrete, never abstract: “a single grain of dust could disrupt the frequency.” The choice to let the ticking rise as silent heresy crystallizes his values with visible cost. Flaw: no contradictory impulse in-scene; he’s monolithically cerebral, muting the potential for fuller human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is consistently embodied (“traveled stillness,” “sorrow of a guardian”) and his micro-choice—lifting the rosette to his eye—physically externalizes the contradiction between hope and fatalism. The students remain anonymous, but their collective failure to sustain the chord functions as a single crucible that forces his resigned renunciation. The ending’s Earned Stasis is fully motivated by the prior causal chain; the cost is legible in the trembling rosette and his return to the window. No diagnostic label-speak; the only slight flattening is the generic “wary souls” tag, too minor to cap.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
    <comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chord emerges, breaks, and leaves the room forever altered—Elian forecloses the path of future attempts. Cost is visible in the trembling rosette and the instantaneous flood of mundane noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“create music not by accumulation, but by subtracting noise”) and holds through the final image of falling leaves. Orientation is anchored by sentence 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—risking death to plant beauty—drives every micro-choice; the final bite’s cost is felt. The “taste memories” gift is shown, not told, and shapes pruning tactics. One flaw: the trait never complicates or backfires; he’s perfectly calibrated. Still, the arc from bitter to sweet is earned through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s involuntary-truth compulsion gives him a sharp, embodied edge—every line he speaks wounds himself and Kael. Interior contradiction is vivid: he relishes the quiet yet feels guilt, and that tension tightens the scene. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear—he withholds the key, forces the riddle, then chooses the reveal—each move costs social/ethical credit on the page. The final endurance (“look at the color”) is earned; flaw complicates rather than excuses, meeting 9- gate though not quite hairline-perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession with “living houses” is vivid, but the emotional cost of his nightly trespass stays abstract; we feel his curiosity, not the bruise of risk. Interiority is rich (“creeping normality noticer”), yet the pivotal moment—placing the root—reads more ritual than irreversible choice, softening the felt stake. The closing renunciation lands, but only because the prose insists; we don’t witness a micro-choice that actually forecloses his return. Still, the contradictions (“dried root smells of blooming flowers”) are character-specific and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s shift from accuser to caretaker is dramatized through her micro-choice to cradle rather than crush the ampoule; the embodied contradiction holds. Caelum’s “incisively kind” stance is shown, not labeled, when his telepathic tone cuts yet comforts. Interiority stays concrete—taste of stale air, loosening grip—avoiding therapy-speak. The only friction: we never learn why Elara alone could descend or what personal loss drove her certainty, so the cost feels collective rather than individually earned.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—philosophical despair braided with tactile ritual (chalk, cracked spectacles, bone dice). His contradictory grin-while-dying optimism is shown, not named, and the micro-choice to scrawl equations underfoot makes the “grim optimist” credible. The only drag: the three-word regret is abstract (“soft currents of air”) and never concretized, so the final grab remains slightly unweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s insomnia, painterly eye, and hunger to rekindle a lost kindness are vivid; the embodied exhaustion and ghost-like grace show rather than label. The memory of the bread-giver and the extinct syllable give sharp personal stakes, and the final surrender to sleep lands as earned cost. Yet the interior contradiction—how moonlight alone recharges the brush—is asserted, not dramatized, keeping him just shy of the 8-band where micro-choices under pressure would fully crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s curator-mentality is vivid—his trembling hands at the starter jar, the lens raised like a private ritual—yet the interior contradiction between custodial duty and edible surrender stays stated rather than dramatized in a single, split-second beat. The final gesture of handing bread to the girl is earned, but the cost to his own identity as guardian of objects is only asserted, not tasted or refused on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—gleeful surgeon-like anticipation while reversing famine—glimmers in “laughing softly,” but we never feel the cost on his body or future. The axis of his identity (clockmaker) is asserted, not embodied; no ticking tools or habitual gestures under pressure. Still, his micro-choice to throw the lever crystallizes a hierarchy of values and supplies a visible, earned renunciation of fate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s self-contradictory hunger for annihilation is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (palming the burning clasp, confessing to the mirror). Interiority stays concrete: “words tearing out of his throat like jagged stones.” The final renunciation—embracing death to starve fear—pays off prior causality with visible palm-scar cost. Advisor remains a peripheral void, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A; single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is dramatized through every beat: she reads clouds, chooses the mallet, risks her raft, and names the storm. No interior contradiction is shown, yet the single-mindedness feels earned because each micro-choice carries salt-spray physical cost. The final smile is a credible renunciation of fear, paid for by the vibrating trunk still warm under her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s quiet, obsessive drive is embodied in micro-choices—adjusting goggles, scanning scutes, finally blowing the whistle. The reed whistle as tactile relic and the pattern-language as private religion make her an individual, not a type. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; the final realization lands as earned horror rather than stated epiphany. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is lucid and ideosyncratic—her cataloguing of the petal as clock is instantly revealing. Micro-choices (crushing petal, locking eyes, lifting case) align with her stated motives and trace visible cost; the final renunciation of the tyrant’s myth is fully earned. Emotional physics stay crisp without therapy-speak; the scene pivots on her rational empathy, not author commentary. No interior contradiction is dramatised, so the impulse layer is slightly under-freighted.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “stoically sensitive” duality is dramatized through micro-choices: he accepts chest-deep brine to serve a private grief-archive, not just a wall. The final concealment of the vial is a renunciation that costs him further exposure, foreclosing any public recognition. Interiority stays concrete—“hushed blaze” rather than abstract guilt. No contradiction or therapy-speak; the flaw (private obsession) drives the climax, not a trait label.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s calm indexer-brain and methodical theft of the stamp feel lived-in; the blackout-quiet lets his tactile precision shine. His decision to risk suffocation for a statistical hunch is credible because every micro-choice (rotating the stamp three degrees, suppressing doubt) is filtered through occupational lens. The only flaw: interiority once labels his doubt “a tremor” instead of letting the hand-twitch speak. Closure’s cost is palpable—he pockets the truth while the turbines restart—so renunciation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—craftsman precision vs. annihilating denial—are embodied in every fold; the bleeding thumb sealing the dream-paper is a micro-choice that costs skin and forecloses his own release. Interiority stays concrete (“rhythmic friction of gem polishing” vs. “sheer force of his denial”) without therapy-speak. The final renunciation—sending the crane to orbit mirrored spires forever—earns its stasis through prior causality and leaves him hollowed on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s survivor-grief obsession is visceral and embodied; every micro-choice is filtered through the wedding massacre. The “toxic hope” that drives him to trip the breakers again shows a credible, flawed endurance that forecloses safety with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s hunger to “decode the frequency of belonging” is anchored in embodied, scene-level choices—every micro-movement on the terrace is filtered through that ache. The internal contradiction between her competence and her felt incompleteness is dramatized, not labeled. The final yank costs the Pilgrim its pseudo-life and costs her the last veil of anonymity; the price is visible and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s guilt is embodied in trembling hands, the bite of gold into palm, and the refusal to accept sweeter false memories—contradictory impulses collide in real time. The micro-choice to pocket the watch hand crystallizes his hierarchy of values: truth over self-exoneration, with the metal’s weight made viscerally costly. Interiority is character-specific (“gardener of bloodlines”), never drifting into diagnostic-speak. A credible, earned endurance: he accepts the irreversible cost of the ghost-boy he created, closing the path to redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interiority is concrete—cold refusal to shiver, tactile memory of the brass pull—and his micro-choice to hand the Commander the rose-stem lever crystallizes his “recycle mistakes” creed with visible cost. The Commander’s exhaustion is shown through gait and jaw tremor, giving both men mirrored vulnerability. Only the prisoner remains a cipher, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for open-sea mastery yet flinching from its cost—are viscerally embodied in the shaking hand that cannot steady the compass. The micro-choice to snap the compass shut and pivot to the utility-pole lattice is credible, irreversible, and costly: he forfeits the identity of “captain of the deep.” Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels; the “loose halyard in a gale” simile is a felt bodily memory, not an abstract slogan. The only bar to 9.0 is that the moment of renunciation, while earned, could carry an even sharper external consequence (e.g., a visible ritual of discarding the compass) to make the cost unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—remembering every murder yet feeling nothing—remains vivid in embodied beats (the white knuckles on the baseball, the choked sob at the end). Motivation to recover empathy is anchored early and drives every micro-choice; the final weeping is a credible renunciation with felt cost. No second character on page, so no relationship crucible; head-count stays default-clean. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-labelling (“apathy…hollowness”) that momentarily flattens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s longing to reclaim the phoenix’s memory is viscerally embodied—his boots cook on scorched earth, his hand refuses to drop the censer even while his bones crystallize. The contradiction between terror of transformation and refusal to retreat is dramatized in the same beat, not summarized, giving us a cost that is simultaneously physical, existential, and emotional. Interiority stays concrete: instead of “he felt love,” the moment is delivered through the bell-like tone of collision and the ash of the fortune slip. Only nit: the “beast whisperer” résumé is asserted rather than demonstrated in micro-choices; one missed chance to let his professional instinct sharpen a beat keeps this just outside 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is vivid—“he had seduced himself with the belief…”—but the epiphany is filtered through a single, summary-laden paragraph rather than dramatized micro-choices; the final refusal to understand is asserted, not shown in a fresh beat. Flaw (ambition-over-family) is clear, yet the moment of self-indictment lands as abstract label (“anatomy of his neglect”) rather than embodied cost. Still, Silas’s perceptual signature and the ritual’s tactile detail keep him above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Contradictory impulses (violence/renunciation) are dramatized in the stitching scene; the final float shows earned cost. Interiority tilts into self-help register (“acknowledge that the capacity for evil…”) that softens the bite at the hinge beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“heartbeat of a ghost,” “fluid and incandescent”—but the final surrender is asserted, not dramatized through micro-choice. The absence of any second character keeps status dynamics off-stage, so the crucible is purely internal; the arc holds but feels slightly monochromatic. The causal link between giving away boots → sand heat → exact release second is elegant, yet the prophecy beat arrives as retrospective label, not lived uncertainty. Still, his flawed generosity stays legible and particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her calm inventiveness under blackout panic is shown via micro-choices (turning inward, sliding the quill, feeling the thrum) rather than labels. The bronze quill’s weight and the kinetic current’s “clean variance” externalize her private calculus; her smile at the end crystallizes a Charged Poise with undeniable cost. One hairline slip: “demeanor was not one of panic” drifts toward diagnostic label, but the embodied beats that follow instantly re-anchor. Overall, her traits, knowledge limits, and moral ambiguity integrate flawlessly into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Oren’s grief-stricken promise to his mother, the burden of unbearable foresight, and his trembling placement of each stone all embody a single, coherent interior contradiction—he courts a future he already sees. The moment his knees grip the rock without slipping is a physical payoff of every prior micro-choice; cost is felt in the electromagnetic backlash and his weeping. No diagnostic labels intrude; tension stays inside body and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s “furiously tranquil” stillness is embodied in the steady hands that pour ether while the storm rages; the internal contradiction is lived, not labeled. Micro-choice—pouring solvent at the timer’s zero—carries the cost of possible discovery and crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Memory flashes (wife’s hand slip, manuscript fire) anchor motive without stock phrasing. Closure’s wonder is earned by this visible, chemical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s “turn questions into destinations” creed is dramatized through the duel-philosophy device and the prosthetic’s micro-choices; the interior contradiction between violence and diplomacy is felt, not declared. Kael’s silent plea is a sharp externalizer of relationship-as-crucible, though his back-story remains a silhouette. Final alignment costs Silas his tactical invulnerability (trapped blade, ozone scent), paying a visible price. Slight over-articulation of “diplomatically fierce” edges toward label-speak, preventing the final 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s monthly personality molt is stated but never dramatized as an on-page cost—no moment shows him losing a skill, memory, or relationship. The Architect stance is vivid in gesture and speech, yet the interior contradiction between old/new selves is asserted rather than enacted. Silas functions as loyal witness without status friction or secondary pressure. The Earned Stasis is credible because the garden act forecloses stealth, but the emotional price is generalized (“invincible certainty”) rather than particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s steely longing is shown through embodied micro-choices—trembling fingers on the clock, the decisive walk into the projector beam—so the interior contradiction registers. The final renunciation (accepting the finite encore in the arbor) is causally linked to his earlier refusal to evacuate, and the cost—eternal disappearance—is legible in the applause-darkness image. Yet the absence of any second character keeps status/relationship pressure off the table, so the arc, while taut, is solo-note. Still, within the single-POV default, the motivation→action→cost chain holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s interiority stays concrete—“luminous doubt shimmered around him” anchors contradictory impulses in body and world. His micro-choices—kaleidoscope twist, kneeling in cold granite—track escalating stakes while flaws (addiction to verification) actively narrow options. Cost is fully paid when he shelters the sprout with his body, trading comfort for cultural survival. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; tension is embodied, not abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Silas’s slow horticultural rhythm and the embodied ritual of exhaling guilt into the bonsai give us a lived-in, contradictory interiority; the final weeping under indigo light is earned because every earlier murmur and tremble has forced this release.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation to “strip needless drama” is rigorously embodied through micro-choices—adjusting ocular filters, tracking dust patterns—and his internal contradiction (cold objectivity vs. humbled awe) culminates in a credible, earned shift. His neural implant and scientific lens shape perception without diagnostic label-speak. The final act—transferring wing dust to his fingertip—is a quiet renunciation of pure detachment, carrying visible emotional cost. No secondary characters dilute focus; the single POV remains tightly calibrated to his perceptual idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, adaptive perception, and glass-artist sensibility shape her survival tactics with concrete specificity. Her motivation to seek purpose, not revenge, feels earned and consistent. The final choice to follow the frost-free tracks emerges organically from her professional intuition and trauma. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her credible endurance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—translating silence into music via thermodynamics—is vividly embodied and drives every action. His capsize trauma informs his physicality and urgency without over-explanation. The contradiction between stoic face and frantic hands reveals layered interiority. Final intervention feels earned, with visible cost in his heaving chest and phantom ocean memory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—burying a noise that refuses to die—is rooted in his identity as an undertaker and manifests through concrete, embodied actions (e.g., slotting the lens like closing a casket). His “inadvertent stubbornness” drives the journey and culminates in Earned Stasis: he endures to secure silence, foreclosing escape until the dead are heard. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile detail (“sodden collar,” “heavier than a granite tombstone”). The final slump against the dais carries visible cost: exhaustion earned by relentless commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s gently persistent nature is embodied through micro-choices—refusing credit, wrapping the bell’s clapper, tracing engravings—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action (calm demeanor vs. relentless focus). Kael’s presence deepens her motivation without overshadowing her agency. The final endurance forecloses dependency, earning Earned Stasis with intergenerational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—driven by a past-life memory of unspoken love—is embodied through specific, tactile actions (adjusting the tripod, swapping lenses, breathing in sync with the spirit). His internal contradiction between obsession and compassion fuels his climactic choice to heal, which carries felt cost: the release of his own stored affection. The ghost’s self-blame is revealed not through exposition but through the camera’s refracted image, making Silas’s response feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through physical ritual and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and professional identity, driving concrete action under pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying grief through tactile resistance to flat memories. The final choice—shoving the halo fragment—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, his internal contradiction remains slightly abstract; we see regret but not simultaneous competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—“to plant resilience in dry soil”—is embodied through precise, high-stakes action under pressure. His “staggering grace” and calm amid chaos reveal a deeply internalized ethos, not stated but enacted. The final renunciation (facing guns after sealing the vault) is earned by every prior micro-choice, especially his decoding of the keys and use of the grain-fletched arrow. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through tactile ritual and strategic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsessive motivation and synesthetic perception are vividly embodied, driving micro-choices with clear cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through sensory fusion and tactile urgency (“breath fogging the glass,” “aurora… sang to her in minor keys”). The final act of imprinting feels earned by her singular fixation, though the absence of interpersonal friction limits relational depth. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics aren’t applicable—but her solitude intensifies the thematic weight of trust’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—metaphysical hunger for destiny’s whispers—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her precise actions. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are rendered through sensory perception (“air tasted of ozone,” “luminous disbelief”). The final revelation lands with credible shock because her competence is balanced by genuine vulnerability. However, the shift from observer to observed lacks a micro-choice that shows internal contradiction in real time—it arrives as discovery, not decision.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is vividly embodied in his ritualized narration and meticulous craft, revealing a character whose defiance is quiet but resolute. His internal contradiction (desire for sanctuary vs. necessity of exposure) manifests in concrete micro-choices: wrapping lenses in wool, leaving the dome behind. The final decision to descend feels earned, with visible cost—the abandonment of a decade’s labor—and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. His “thoughtfully spirited” demeanor is shown through action, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—paralysis versus hyper-vigilance, terror versus determination—are embodied with visceral specificity (“knees knocking,” “mind locked onto the task with trembling certainty”). His motivation arises organically from his defective amygdala and recent betrayal, driving micro-choices (tilting the cast, inverting protocols) that reconfigure power dynamics. The final renunciation of flight for strategic enclosure is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost: he remains terrified, but now weaponizes it. No diagnostic label-speak; fear degrades perception yet sharpens attention in character-consistent ways.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—mapping the end to guide lost souls—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her obsession with gold flaking mirrors cosmic decay, revealing interior contradiction: she clings to a text while documenting its irrelevance. Micro-choices (trapping flakes, interpreting silences) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Final renunciation—closing eyes in total blackness—is earned by prior causality and charged with irrevocable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Unit 734’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—his “defect” of curiosity drives micro-choices (e.g., scanning for the origin of thought during cleanup) that reveal a hierarchy of values. His emotional embodiment avoids therapy-speak; sorrow is rendered through tactile observation (“air tasted of ozone and regret”) and professional composure under metaphysical pressure. The final renunciation—accepting another night without answers—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he archives data to search again, foreclosing immediate resolution. No head-hopping or knowledge drift; his limitations (sentient but servile) shape every action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—to thaw mistrust through transparency—is rooted in a romantic yearning that feels authentic and urgent. His internal conflict (hoarding vs. sharing, secrecy vs. vulnerability) manifests physically through micro-choices: extending the lens, offering specific tickets. Mara’s arc is slightly less embodied but credibly shifts from suspicion to shared burden. The flaw: her emotional reversal leans on a single intense sensation rather than layered doubt-to-trust progression.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—rooted in penance and quiet defiance of quantified luck—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (polishing marbles, building cairns) that reveal his internal contradiction: a fraud turned faithful caretaker. His “wisely pragmatic” restraint contrasts with the sub-prefect’s brittle dogma, deepening character without exposition. The final line (“broken tools cast the brightest light”) crystallizes his earned wisdom without sentimentality. Every micro-choice reflects his hierarchy of values, with cost visible in his weathered body and obsolete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s obsession is credibly rooted in his quiet competence and masked radicalism; his internal contradiction—yearning for lateral escape versus duty-bound restraint—manifests physically (gloved hands on lever, wrench as anchor). The final renunciation feels earned: he witnesses transcendence but chooses linear reality, bearing the cost of secrecy. No diagnostic label-speak mars his epiphany; emotion is embodied in fogged breath, pricking skin, hammering heart.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—driven by a ghostly compulsion and professional invisibility—is consistent and intensifies credibly. His internal conflict (discipline vs. feverish creativity) manifests in embodied choices, like risking the program’s destruction. The final renunciation—lowering the baton instead of conducting—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: he remains alone, forever marked but unchanged in station. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars his emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fever, graphite-stained tremor, and gut-level dread of the “swallowed truth” render his fault-tolerant nature as both gift and curse. His micro-choice to smudge the illustration’s margin reveals a hierarchy of values: systemic stability over personal relief, truth over panic. The contradiction between engineered resilience and human sorrow is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. His final endurance (“existing quietly in the margins of the apocalypse”) earns Charged Poise with crushing solitude as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his exhaustion, skepticism, and guilt manifest through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., releasing the valve wheel). His motivation (“to find the weight of a swallowed truth”) is tightly braided with the central thematic question about negligence vs. malice, and his final renunciation carries visible emotional cost. The backstory is anchored in present stimuli (radio calls, condensation on metal) and tilts his stance without flattening pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—witnessing change without judgment—is embodied consistently and deepens through micro-choices (e.g., handling the swan, accepting decay). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are tactile (“arthritis vanished,” “clouded eyes tracing lines”). The final renunciation of archival duty is earned by her prior stance, yielding Earned Stasis with visible cost: she surrenders the library to become keeper of silence. No secondary characters dilute focus, preserving single-POV clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to nurture lifelong wonder—is credibly embodied in his restrained actions and micro-choices, especially his deliberate timing during the eclipse. Elara’s transformation feels earned through tactile and sensory triggers rather than diagnostic exposition. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see the result of memory return but not the struggle within. The story avoids therapy-speak but leans slightly on implied emotional logic rather than dramatized cognitive dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his belief that architecture retains psychic residue, and his sensitivity drives every action. His interiority is embodied—fingers tracing rivets, feeling “cold spike of panic”—not abstracted. The final choice to descend after retrieving truth feels earned, with cost implied in the world’s dreamless sterility. However, his oddness remains more aesthetic than psychologically contradictory, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arthur’s motivation—escaping a self-perpetuating cycle of doom—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly. His internal conflict (transmitting orders vs. rewriting fate) manifests through embodied choices: donning specs, manipulating the lens. The “accidentally prophetic” flaw creates genuine struggle without safety-hedging. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost: severing his only lifeline to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kellen’s motivation is vividly rooted in his role and methods, with micro-choices (e.g., stomping the pedal, filtering frequencies) revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Elias’s arc is credibly rendered through physical unraveling and emotional release, though his interiority remains secondary. The final exchange (“assumptions are made to be broken”) lands as earned renunciation, not epiphany. Minor deduction: Elias’s transformation leans slightly on external action rather than internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—chronological homesickness and the desire to conduct unheard symphonies—is vividly embodied through concrete actions (grease-pencil notation, shell conduction) and internal contradictions (exhaustion vs. urgency). His emotional arc feels earned, not diagnostic, and his final transcendence arises organically from prior choices. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, and while his flaws are present, their cost is subtly implied rather than viscerally dramatized. The closure renunciation (“the ache vanished”) is resonant but leans slightly toward epiphany without a tangible tradeoff beyond time and stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her gravity defiance as symptom, not choice; her tactile grip on the tablet; her visceral rejection of fractured selves. Her final renunciation (“Not this time”) and surrender to gravity feel earned through micro-choices (trusting illogical runes, ignoring spectral echoes). The cost—“crushing, beautiful burden of being real”—is specific and resonant. However, her emotional state occasionally leans toward diagnostic abstraction (“periodically eternal”) without sufficient counterbalancing physicality in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through tactile ritual—is rooted in consistent traits (deafness, musical past) and intensifies credibly. His interiority is concrete (“fingertips grazing the damp walls,” “skeletal arms”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The contradictory impulses (yearning for feeling vs. fear of grief) act simultaneously during the needle-drop climax. His final micro-choice—teaching again—is earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of raw sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—integrity through solitude—is credibly rooted in her role as storm recorder and drives every choice, including the lateral escape that preserves data over safety. Her interiority is concrete (“air felt heavy with unspoken threats”) and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of her station for the message tube shows earned endurance with visible cost. However, the transition from scientific caution to immediate trust in the pigeon borders on slightly abrupt without deeper internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—aromatic caution versus sensory sacrifice—are embodied in trembling hands, loosened straps, and inhalation under UV light. Her motivation is consistent, specific, and intensifies credibly toward recklessness. The memory-triggered grief feels earned, not diagnostic, with tears “gleaming like drops of mercury” showing emotion through image, not label. Final renunciation (resealing the vial) forecloses recovery with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—artistic obsession over survival—is embodied through tactile actions (laying rope, scraping clay) and internal contradictions (playful daring vs. mortal fear). His final choice to reject transcendence for flawed humanity feels earned, not abstract. The frayed rope functions as both physical tether and psychological anchor, grounding his renunciation in concrete sensation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from granular friction (“silk dragged over gravel”) and bodily stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is embodied through micro-choices (igniting the fire, playing an unresolved melody) and consistent with her hyper-acoustic perception. Her internal conflict between grief and resilience simmers beneath restrained action, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The absence of secondary characters simplifies relational dynamics but keeps focus on her solitary endurance, which reads as credible renunciation rather than passivity. However, her flaw (sensitivity as both gift and curse) isn’t tested by a mistake that compounds pressure, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas and Elara are vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—Silas’s “affectionate detachment,” Elara’s surrender masking desperation. Their motivations are rooted in consistent, profession-specific traits (counterfeit emotion dealer, grief-stricken client) and drive micro-choices with visible cost: Silas refuses erasure, offering half-truths instead; Elara trades authenticity for bearable memory. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception (“static electricity prickling his forearms”). The final renunciation—Elara accepting synthetic peace—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of lost truth.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—his observational acuity and moral debt from past kindness—and his internal conflict (professional caution vs. emotional risk) plays out in embodied hesitation and micro-choices. The librarian’s guarded-to-open transformation feels earned through specific reactions to the locket. However, her interiority remains slightly underdeveloped beyond functional response, limiting full reciprocity in the relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—grafting onto the community—is rendered with visceral specificity through her marsh-reed craft and bold sympathy. Her interiority is embodied in tactile choices (humming, weaving reeds) rather than abstract longing. The boy’s injury catalyzes a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values: tenderness over conformity. Her transformation from outsider to kin feels earned because it emerges from consistent action, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as an illustrator, and her internal conflict—between artistic obsession and bodily cost—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., activating the pendant despite knowing the price). Her emotional state degrades believably under stress, shown through physical toll rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of time for art feels earned, with visible aging marking irreversible cost. However, her backstory remains slightly abstract; we see what she wants but not why echoes matter beyond professional curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—grief fused with intellectual obsession—is rendered through precise, embodied choices: arranging glass eyes, pouring silver sap, interpreting fractures as emotional algorithms. His internal contradiction (logic vs. longing) manifests simultaneously in action and perception, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final micro-choice—not weeping but pocketing the eyes—reveals a hierarchy of values (data over despair) with tangible cost: he endures ambiguity yet recalibrates hope. No unmotivated epiphanies; his buried optimism arises from ritual failure, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to become visible not as an intruder but as providence—is embodied through precise, tactile choices (e.g., dust-free placement of the tape) and contradicted by his necessary erasure, creating authentic tension. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through sensory memory and physical restraint. The librarian’s brief but vivid presence functions as a crucible, making his final act both intimate and high-stakes. His renunciation of anonymity carries felt cost, earned by consistent behavior and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scientific detachment masks primal fear, and his contradictory impulses (control vs. surrender) act simultaneously in scene. His final renunciation is earned through escalating physical and psychological stakes, with visible cost: loss of human form and identity. The “circuitously sincere” voice feels authentic to a reclusive botanist under duress, avoiding diagnostic label-speak even at peak crisis. His micro-choice to open his hand—not tear the leaf—is a precise, character-driven pivot that crystallizes his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s insomnia, obsession with decay, and trade of survival for symbolism form a coherent, embodied arc. His contradiction—craving meaning while sacrificing water—fuels the pivotal exchange. The scavenger’s radiation burns and rasping voice convey history without exposition. Final trembling hands show awe, not sentimentality, grounding his epiphany in physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—between her prophetic certainty and her blindness to the present—is embodied through precise micro-choices (withdrawing her hand, truly seeing Kael) that carry visible cost: the loss of her old interpretive framework. Her flaw (overlooking the mundane) directly causes her blindsiding, and the epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring in sensory awe (“morning dew on a spiderweb”). Kael functions effectively as a crucible, though his interiority remains secondary, which is acceptable under Track A defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—reactively visionary—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., staggered trumpet blasts) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through tactile perception (“navigated absences,” “scattered data points of grief and hope”). The final act earns closure via visible cost: his archival solitude transforms into communal authorship, foreclosing his former isolation. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; all insight arises from dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—between obsessive control and yearning for emotional truth—is embodied in her mapping ritual and culminates in the shattering of her own confession jar. Her micro-choices (punching the void, stepping onto spectral platforms) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. The flaw (“mapping as defense against intimacy”) is not stated but dramatized through action and integrated into closure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile (“heart hammered,” “trembling certainty”).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her scientific skepticism clashes with embodied emotional resonance, especially when “entangled memories” press against her mind. Her micro-choice to continue transcribing despite professional risk reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The shift from cataloging to “sculpt[ing] space for reflection” feels earned through tactile interaction with the magic square and whale-song vibrations. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and awe emerge through sensory immersion rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—boredom sharpened by eons of memory and a clawing need to know “what happens after goodbye”—is vividly embodied and consistent. His internal contradiction (immortal weariness vs. desperate curiosity) drives every micro-choice, culminating in a renunciation that incinerates his boredom at the cost of his form. The shard-handling, magnetic manipulation, and final step into dissolution are all extensions of this core impulse. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile perception (“pulsing in his teeth,” “black smoke,” “atom by atom”).

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Julian’s motivation—“the mathematics of a fair trade”—is embodied through precise micro-choices (offering the ink, waiting actively) and contradicted by his radical candor versus inherited dexterity. Elena’s presence as a humanized “fugitive” sharpens Vance’s transformation, though her interiority remains thin by necessity of scope. Vance’s shift from binary rigidity to empathy is credibly triggered by the ink’s effect, not sentimentality. The trio’s dynamics serve the central moral calculus without caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “incandescent restraint” masks burning curiosity, and her micro-choices (e.g., breath-holding during the lamp’s pitch dip) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her motivation (“to collect the textures of different times”) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, her backstory remains abstract; we never see how her role as a stationer shaped her moral or emotional limits. The final renunciation—guardianship of false memories—is earned but lacks a visible personal sacrifice beyond implied isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to resurrect emotional residue from discarded objects—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., layering specific overheard fragments onto the poison label) that reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring the forgotten over self-preservation. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering perception as sensory synthesis (“the label began to vibrate with a constructed sorrow”). The final act of placing the charged artifact in the pavement crack enacts Earned Stasis: a renunciation of identity that forecloses reintegration into the official world, with cost legible in “I am the archivist of the unremembered.” No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; single-POV execution is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “gloomy cheerfulness,” fear disguised as logic, and self-deception feel lived-in, not diagnostic. His micro-choices (wedging the shell, shouting his retelling) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of myth-busting for myth-participation is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. No therapy-speak; contradictions act simultaneously (“relentless myth buster” now embracing narrative).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s dual allegiance and internal conflict are embodied through precise micro-choices—adjusting her respirator, spraying coded graffiti, wedging the stone—that reveal a hierarchy of loyalties under pressure. Her motivation intensifies credibly from mediation to sabotage, with visible cost in her isolation and moral risk. The final act of sealing the stone with lacquer crystallizes her renunciation of corporate complicity without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—“purposefully curious”—is embodied in tactile choices: the stolen sand grain, chemical timer, and forbidden summit vigil. His internal contradiction (duty vs. aesthetic reverence) intensifies under pressure without therapy-speak. The sharp pain of the grain grounds his focus, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost: enduring cold, risking discipline, sacrificing warmth for one image. Final renunciation (lowering the camera into eternal glare) is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and precise—his blindness informs tactile perception without melodrama, and his calm under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values (precision over haste). His motivation (“to decode feedback into direction”) emerges organically from action, not exposition. The courier serves as effective secondary pressure without diluting focus. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in displaced air, calloused fingers, and rhythmic thrumming.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s dry, precise interiority is vividly embodied—his contempt for his spectacles, his tactile reliance on the phrasebook’s dog-ear, and his clinical observation of condensation reveal a mind that maps the world through control. His motivation—to find the metaphysical source of rivers—is consistent and deepened by his professional identity. The final choice to withhold coordinates feels earned, a renunciation charged with quiet cost: knowledge too true for commodification. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—restoring shared balance through rhythm—is consistent, embodied, and drives micro-choices (e.g., tapping the paver, stepping to disrupt chaos). His “infinitely patient” endurance is shown, not told, culminating in Earned Stasis: he accepts inevitable collapse but refuses to let silence win. No internal contradiction weakens his resolve, yet his struggle feels human because success is fleeting and costly. The miners’ unconscious alignment reveals his influence without speech, grounding his cryptic role in tangible action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal conflict—between survival instinct and duty—is embodied through trembling fingers, hypoxia-induced blur, and intrusive psychic flashes. Her final renunciation (choosing signal over life) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains visceral (“lungs burned,” “fear clawing at her throat”). The artifact’s resonance forces micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and rooted in generational shame; his interiority is embodied through tactile interaction with the driftwood lattice and trembling fingers. His final act of disappearance is earned by prior causality—his warnings ignored, his name cursed—and carries visible cost: exile into metaphysical uncertainty. However, the transition from passive despair to active escape lacks a micro-choice that dramatizes internal contradiction; it arrives as revelation rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Julian’s motivation—survival via ancestral debt—is clear, consistent, and embodied in his trembling grip on the bead and cautious navigation of the orchard. His internal conflict (desperation vs. reverence) manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic abstraction. The ghost bride’s silent agency is credible within the established lore, and her choice to sever the bond after repayment feels inevitable. The final “mournful elation” crystallizes a renunciation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her rejection of fatalism, and her actions—sleepwalking while stitching chasms—embody a poetic defiance that feels earned. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion emerges through tactile detail (e.g., tracing the oxidized plate) and embodied trance states. The “hauntingly optimistic” smile amid lethal risk reveals a compelling contradiction between serenity and peril. Her renunciation of decay as destiny culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses passive acceptance with visible cost: exhaustion after weaving the fissure shut.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring lost faith through tactile reconnection with ancestral history—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies organically. Her “warmly curious” interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion emerges through precise sensory engagement (“skull cradled so tenderly by a fig root”). The final act of rebuilding the sundial earns her transformed sense of belonging through visible labor and emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (modern solitude vs. buried history) coexist without resolution until the closing image crystallizes integration.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—his devotion to tangible privacy in a digitized world drives every micro-choice, from selecting “Arthur Pendelton” to folding the letter with ritual care. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile reverence for obsolete tools amid urgent stakes. The absence of secondary characters simplifies relational pressure but sharpens focus on his solitary moral calculus. His final act of mailing the letter crystallizes his renunciation of speed and surveillance, with cost felt in the erasure of chalk and the vulnerability of physical delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lysa’s contradictory impulses—frailty vs. agency, deception vs. truth-telling—are embodied in precise micro-choices (fumbling the spool, straightening posture) that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation is consistent and deepened by the cost of maintaining her disguise while acting against Kael. The emotional progression avoids diagnostic labels and remains rooted in tactile, character-specific perception. Final renunciation (reassuming senility after completing the map) is earned and carries visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Julian’s motivation—retracing a marital rupture—is rooted in shame and misperception, embodied through trembling hands and the weight of the shard. His internal conflict (pride vs. regret) acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Elara’s cryptic presence applies precise pressure without overshadowing Julian’s arc. The final micro-choice—to write the letter—emerges credibly from his reconfigured understanding, with emotional cost legible in his tears and lighter stone.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his trauma surfaces through tactile interaction with the coral and cast, not diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to rewrite the warning into a lullaby reveals a hierarchy of values: protecting Leo’s psyche over preserving historical truth. The contradiction between his professional detachment (translator of screams) and this intimate act of narrative grafting feels earned. Final renunciation of passive witnesshood carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to rediscover lost joy—is vividly embodied through tactile engagement with the fresco fragment and her light-painting, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her internal contradiction (creator in a world that obscures creation) fuels credible micro-choices, like pressing the fragment to the tree to access memory. The final chuckle reveals earned wisdom without sentimentality. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward resolution without sufficient friction—her anxiety dissolves too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his weariness of certainty, tactile connection to the hobo nickel, and sensory immersion in each awakening layer feel specific and unforced. His final reply crystallizes a credible renunciation of epistemic rigidity, earned through the nested dream logic. The micro-choice to toss the coin reveals his hierarchy of values: curiosity over control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through perception (“paper-thin skin,” “smell of iron and stale tobacco”).

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Julian’s contradictions—charming yet subversive, scholarly yet reckless—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., riddling to overheat auditors) and align with his motivation to protect cognitive autonomy. His flaw (overconfidence in analog resistance) compounds under pressure but doesn’t undermine plausibility. Aris functions effectively as a pressure conduit, not a full character, fitting scope. Final renunciation of mental taxation feels earned, though the emotional cost leans conceptual over visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to photosynthesize pain into beauty—is embodied through tactile ritual and micro-choices (thumbing the postcard, releasing the lullaby, tucking the card away). His internal contradiction—eternal wakefulness versus creative duty—is dramatized without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of the postcard feels earned by centuries of implied repetition, with visible cost in his cracked knees and empty hands. Flawless interiority anchored in sensory detail elevates this beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted in preserving ephemeral human sounds, and his actions—especially the trembling removal of the bamboo and the hummed repair—are embodied expressions of grief and duty. His internal conflict between futility and devotion manifests in micro-choices with visible cost: he remains despite knowing no one may ever hear the names. The phrase “foxglove regret” crystallizes a character-specific emotion that avoids diagnostic label-speak by tying toxicity to beauty. His endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: he forecloses escape by choosing guardianship in a vacuum.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is visceral and consistent, rooted in her identity as a linguist who communicates through arcane syntax rather than speech. Her “carefully reckless” actions under pressure—reaching into chaotic magic with gloved hands—embody internal contradiction: precision vs. desperation. Kael’s shift from fear to recognition feels earned because it responds directly to Elara’s physicalized vulnerability, not exposition. The final handclasp carries relational cost: silence broken only through shared risk, not easy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—balancing Council law against saving lives—is vividly embodied in his trembling hands and precise mechanical choices. His internal conflict manifests physically (“sweat and grease,” “adrenaline of defying an empire”) without diagnostic labels.

No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; all insight arises from tactile engagement with tools and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—to preserve Martian wind songs via pigeon flight—is singular, embodied, and drives precise micro-choices (e.g., dust-mote mapping, capsule balancing). His internal conflict between solitude and trust manifests physically: stiffening at intrusion, then stilling his hand for Aero. The woman’s presence catalyzes credible emotional shift without therapy-speak; his exhaustion halts another lie. Final renunciation of anonymity carries felt cost: “the death of his solitude giving way to the growth of a shared secret.”

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her father’s mazes and the collapse of temporal boundaries—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are filtered through tactile perception (“featherly determined,” “rough surface”). The final renunciation (rebuilding walls, not bridges) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—her resolve feels singular rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her burnt feather, her cold ascent toward stars, her breath hitching—all reveal a fractured self seeking cohesion. Her final relinquishment of the feather feels earned, not epiphanic, and Kael’s “softly ingenious” actions apply quiet pressure that crystallizes her choice. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“rough texture of failure,” “warm against the chill”). Their shared exhale functions as a micro-choice with visible cost: surrendering isolation for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, obsessive, and embodied through precise micro-choices—scrambling over jagged terrain, projecting hope as a hypothesis—that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting through tactile curiosity (“gloved finger,” “hummed her dirge”) and morally ambiguous delight in others’ despair. The final renunciation—accepting that the path was meant to be inhabited, not followed—is earned by her prior actions and reframes her life’s work without sentimentality. Flawed yet coherent, she reads as an individual, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—“to serenade monotony with creativity”—is embodied through precise micro-choices (adjusting the soda can, placing the bishop) that reveal his analytical obsession and emotional restraint. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action: a ghostly presence who engineers joy without claiming credit. The woman’s brief but vivid arc—from slumped despair to startled laughter—serves as crucible, not caricature. Final renunciation (vanishing into shadows) is earned, with visible cost: his art remains anonymous, reinforcing his isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s motivation—rooted in visceral opposition to the nostalgia ban—is embodied through precise physicality and micro-choices (e.g., shielding her glowing skin from drones). Her internal contradiction (grace vs. lethal power, compliance vs. rebellion) operates simultaneously without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of the city is earned by prior causality, with exile as a visible cost. No emotional summarizing; pain “clarifies” rather than explains.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—illuminating value in the mundane—is embodied through precise micro-choices (kneeling, flicking the pebble) and interiority rooted in his craft as a glazier. His fear of exposure and need for reassurance feel authentic, not diagnostic. The final renunciation (“not to fix the world, but to frame it”) is earned by the ripple vision and carries conceptual cost. No emotional summarizing or label-speak mars his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—his “hard softness” manifests in tactile choices (e.g., cradling the box with calloused hands). His motivation—translating pain into universal language—is rooted in trauma and intensifies through reflection that alters his stance. The renunciation of bitterness feels earned, with visible cost in his hollowed survivor identity. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from sensory recall of fire and porcelain.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly specific—his “logical dreaming” manifests through embodied actions (tying Möbius ribbons, calibrating the gauge) rather than abstract introspection. His motivation to engineer hope via geometric precision feels consistent and compelling, with micro-choices (e.g., selecting velvet over silk) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation isn’t passive but active endurance, foreclosing despair with tangible cost: the weight of responsibility in a dying multiverse. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—professional duty masking an esoteric quest—is compellingly layered and embodied through tactile interactions with ruins. His empathy for stone feels specific, not metaphorical shorthand, and culminates in a credible endurance: accepting the burden of memory. The diary discovery forces a micro-choice (to excavate, to carry out) that reveals his hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; sorrow is felt in “cracked lintel,” not named.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to alter reflections, not people—is consistent and compelling, rooted in a precise magical ethos. Her interiority remains embodied (“perceptively calm,” hands on wet stone) without diagnostic labels. The man’s arc is secondary but credibly rendered through reflection; his shift from slumped to purposeful feels earned by the mirage’s intervention. No flaws compromise closure, though Elara’s transience slightly limits emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s “operative gentleness” is embodied in micro-choices (nodding, tapping the clipboard) that disarm hardened warlords without sentimentality. Hark and Vena reveal contradictory impulses—Hark’s gravelly admission of “Elara,” Vena’s ceramic tears—making their grief feel earned, not theatrical. Their speech carries distinct idiom (Hark’s rusted-gear growl vs. Vena’s sniper-cold brevity), and their flaws directly enable the ritual’s success. The final renunciation—signing over their children’s names—forecloses future violence with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vance’s contradictory impulses—ruthless profiteer versus secret mourner—are embodied in precise, tactile choices: kneeling in tailored trousers, placing the egg with ritual care. His internal conflict operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries, and culminates in an irrational act that forecloses no practical path but reveals his hierarchy of values.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through action, texture, and restraint.

    Elara’s motivation—defiance through withheld intimacy—is embodied in her actions and reinforced by consistent internal contradiction: she preserves her body to preserve others’ souls. Her final choice carries visible cost (sacrificing her hoarded intimacy) and aligns with established traits. The Magistrate’s reaction sharpens the stakes without flattening Elara’s agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile sensation (“shocks of cold pain”) and poetic physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motivation—to challenge linear morality through art—is consistent and embodied in precise, character-specific actions (e.g., reversing puppet motions like “wet ink sucked back into the nib”). His “uncommon serenity” contrasts with the volatile setting, revealing a hierarchy of values where aesthetic integrity outweighs confrontation. The heckler’s muting shows relational pressure resolved through performance, not dialogue. Flaws are implicit in his elitism, yet the story avoids diagnostic self-awareness or tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his esoteric realism manifests through tactile reverence for overlooked loss, not abstract musing. His micro-choices (weaving the structure, embedding the moth wing) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: honoring the anonymous over the iconic. The final renunciation—turning away as both monarch and moth wing face dispersal—is earned by his established ethos. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in hands, gaze, and posture.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and redemption, with interiority rendered through concrete sensory detail (“snowmelt ardor,” “thumb over perforations”) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—coating the card, reconfiguring the rope—are precise, technically grounded, and charged with emotional weight. The final act of casting embodies a credible endurance that forecloses his past numbness with visible cost: years of error transformed into bronze permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s fractured perception drives every choice with visceral embodiment—her trembling hands, the taste of vision on her tongue—and her final act merges flawlessly with her curse. The micro-choice to break the seal crystallizes her hierarchy of values: agency over obedience. No diagnostic label-speak; her struggle is shown through tactile urgency and dream logic. Her blindness to the “now” makes her decisive action profoundly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Bel-ibni’s parsimony is embodied in every micro-choice—from extinguishing torches to hoarding chalk—and his internal contradiction (skepticism yielding to empirical proof of sentience) drives the climax. His emotional restraint reads as character-specific, not performative, and his final nod is a perfectly calibrated gesture of triumph within his frugal ethos. The flaw of rigid efficiency becomes the very mechanism of salvation, making his endurance feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s contradictory nature—scheming yet pacifist—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., pressing the cylinder to Kaelen’s pulse point) rather than stated. Kaelen’s transformation feels earned through cellular memory, not epiphany, and his physical collapse mirrors internal reconfiguration. The flaw-as-breath motif reframes strength credibly. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile and conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—to capture a runaway dream of an unlived life—is vividly embodied through precise physical actions (anchoring in mud, synchronized breathing) and consistent with his identity as a mirror maker. His internal conflict between desire and dissolution is rendered without therapy-speak, using tactile, sensory detail (“lungs burning with the cold fire of creation”). The story avoids over-explaining his past; instead, his choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her quartz eye, peppermint, and feisty dialogue reveal a consistent, flawed character whose micro-choices (e.g., rejecting standard tools for her daughter’s ribbon) stem from deep-seated values. Her motivation to “bridge generational wisdom” isn’t stated abstractly but dramatized through tactile memory and maternal history. The contradiction between her stubbornness and tenderness drives the climax credibly. Final renunciation of control (“let it change”) feels earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—teeth aching from luminous anxiety, trembling fingers on the shell—and his contradictory impulses (dread vs. duty, curiosity vs. fear) act simultaneously in-scene. His final choice to carve “the face of the fear he felt right now” is earned by prior causality and carries existential cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory detail and micro-choices (locking the bathroom door, flushing for punctuation). One minor slip: the “nonlinear inheritance” premise risks overriding character logic, but Elian’s bewilderment grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is razor-sharp and consistent: her linguistic expertise directly enables the rescue, and her actions reveal a hierarchy of values—knowledge over force, precision over haste. Her interiority is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., conserving magic, analyzing moss) rather than exposition. The Time Traveler’s burdened presence adds relational pressure without diluting focus. Both characters feel specific, flawed, and constrained by the mountain’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a biologically specific trauma—her chimera twin status—and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile detail (e.g., clutching the swatch card while feeling her sister’s “phantom” heartbeat). Her final renunciation—choosing not to extract the ghost—is earned by prior micro-choices that demonstrate escalating emotional risk. The story passes the 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses (desire for separation vs. acceptance of fusion) act in scene, and the closure carries visible cost—the relinquishment of imagined dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—his identity as an archivist drives every action. His interiority is concrete (“warmly methodical,” “tenderness usually reserved for repairing ancient scrolls”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final act of merging timelines is earned through prior causality, with visible cost (grease, time-dust, dissolution of the seal). However, internal contradiction is minimal; his competence borders on frictionless, slightly undercutting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)

No internal contradiction weakens her resolve, but the single-minded focus suits the compressed form.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)

The final weeping validates her belief with emotional cost, avoiding diagnostic or therapeutic phrasing.

No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (longing vs. resolve) coexist organically. The final act of writing is earned by prior pressure and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to defy hopelessness through pyrotechnic artistry—is vividly embodied and consistent, with micro-choices (adjusting sulfur for humidity, spinning the rag knot) revealing his professional ethos and emotional stakes. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action: whimsy masking gravity, precision amid decay. The lone flaw is slight flattening of refugees into passive witnesses, limiting relational pressure. Still, his final renunciation—walking away after restoring light—carries earned stasis with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception—her thumb tracing the jade cicada, her refusal to meet Kael’s eyes—and her contradictions (warm affection vs. grief, acceptance vs. loss) operate simultaneously without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)

Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions arise through tactile urgency (“stepping through the thundering cascade”) rather than exposition. The final act—sitting on the throne—is earned by prior micro-choices that narrow options and accept risk.

    Mara’s internal conflict—clutching the doorknocker as both proof of escape and anchor to ruin—is rendered through embodied tension (“white-knuckled,” “stiff and aching”) and credible emotional contradiction. Elian functions not as a plot device but as a resonant counterweight whose scars mirror her severance, deepening motivation without exposition. The final release feels earned because her fear (“If I drop it, I will have nothing”) directly opposes her need for breath, crystallizing a renunciation with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—forged in pyramid-scheme trauma and crystallized as “translate pressure into diamonds”—is consistent, embodied, and drives his climactic choice. His internal contradiction (skepticism vs. willingness to absorb multiversal debt) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The rusted bolt and diamond payoff feel earned through prior causality, with visible cost (knees buckling, lungs burning). However, the phrase “virtuously mischievous” leans slightly toward label-speak without deeper behavioral contradiction.

    Elian’s motivation is clear, consistent, and embodied through precise physical actions—especially his reliance on intuition over logic while cranking the gramophone.

His motivation evolves credibly from obsession to acceptance, with the compass serving as both object and mirror. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; his epiphany emerges through action, not exposition.

His internal drive (“to discover what ceilings hide”) is specific, not abstract, and his micro-choices (waiting for silence, reading dust patterns) reveal a hierarchy of values. The flaw: minimal internal contradiction—he’s competent without meaningful struggle or blind spots that compound.

His internal conflict—doubt versus conviction—is rendered through physical tremors, breath control, and tactile precision, never abstract self-diagnosis.

His internal contradiction—cautious abandon—is enacted physically on the parapet and in his ritualistic swaps.

However, the transition from paralysis to decisive action lacks a micro-choice that visibly alters her tactics; she simply “snatches” the artifact without intermediate struggle. This slight motivational leap prevents a 9+ score despite strong interiority and kintsugi-driven resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief manifests in tactile choices (painting the shell, navigating caves) rather than abstract lament. His “intimately aloof” nature directly shapes his refusal to engage with townspeople while obsessively preserving Elara’s memory. The final renunciation—releasing the painted shell—is earned by consistent behavior and carries palpable emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; his contradictions feel human, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—“to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts”—is vividly embodied through his agonizing, tactile projection of “screaming tenderness.” His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting as physical ache and trembling effort. The head keeper functions effectively as a foil whose obliviousness heightens Elias’s isolation and stakes. However, the absence of any micro-choice beyond the final act slightly limits the demonstration of hierarchical values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in embodied trauma and active renunciation—she endures spectral grief to guide lost souls, making her both map and terrain. Her micro-choices (wielding the censer foot, cranking the dish) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering sorrow as physical resonance (“felt the sorrow of the flock passing through her own bones”). The final Earned Stasis—slumping with cooling bronze—forecloses escape and affirms her sacred duty.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness and empathy-virus affliction create a compelling interior contradiction that drives every micro-choice. His rationality clashes with desperate superstition in a way that feels embodied, not diagnostic—especially when he treats mantras like chemical formulas. The final lie (“I am the king of this orchard”) lands as earned defiance, not epiphany. No safety-hedging; his flaws directly enable and complicate his salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained fingers, trembling joints, gasping breath—and his motivation (to decode the boutonniere) emerges from consistent traits: empathy for psychological debris, obsession with gaps. His final choice (honoring voluntary forgetting) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; grief and isolation are felt through sensory detail, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in grief and a specific promise, compelling his high-stakes choices under rising physical danger. His “empirically intuitive” trait manifests through embodied perception (scent, vibration, ant movement) rather than exposition, and his final renunciation—facing rather than changing the past—is earned by prior causality. The emotional arc avoids tidy resolution; instead, it crystallizes into Charged Poise with visible cost: drowning or stepping into memory. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Isolde’s disenchantment and yearning are embodied through tactile details (“numbness in her royal fingers,” “sky weeping viscous light”) and culminate in a credible renunciation of queenship for guardianship. Her internal contradiction—between regal duty and existential hunger—is active throughout, not summarized. Valerius serves as effective secondary pressure without diluting focus. The final choice feels earned, though the shift from despair to purpose leans slightly on the fireflies’ sudden appearance rather than deeper prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—capturing “the density of presence”—is rooted in a scientifically romantic worldview that feels consistent and deeply personal. His internal contradiction (desire to preserve impermanence) manifests physically through precise, embodied actions, not abstraction. Kaelen’s arrival introduces relational pressure that forces Elian to revalue their shared time instantly, crystallizing his emotional stakes without melodrama. The final renunciation—handing over the pocket sun—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, feral nostalgia, jealousy as a hook—and his contradictions (longing for innocence while resenting it) drive micro-choices like invoking the trance and documenting the dream. His motivation to “distill chaos into narrative” aligns with every action, and the final act of writing feels earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through concrete sensation and behavior. The only near-flaw: slight abstraction in “jaded wonder,” but it’s grounded by immediate context.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s loss of smell is not a gimmick but the engine of his reoriented perception, driving micro-choices (e.g., reading Kael’s anxiety through jaw tension) and culminating in the earned act of offering the screw. His motivation—to unveil ordinary miracles—is dramatized through action, not stated. The birthing clamp screw becomes an extension of his altered sensory world, enabling a repair that hinges on emotional intuition rather than mechanical precision. Kael’s arc is subtle but legible: his skepticism yields to reverence, marked by the single nod that carries immense emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s crystallization affliction is embodied with visceral specificity, and her internal conflict—between academic rigor and childhood superstition—is dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to “transform scars into stories” directly fuels the climax, and the shedding act reconfigures her identity with tangible cost. The panic-to-poise arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness, instead rendering emotion through physical sensation and constrained action. Final renunciation of logic for irrational belief feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s grief and guilt are embodied in her trembling, fixation on the bottle, and broken plea—never summarized. Silas’s moral fatigue is shown through tactile details (frayed cuffs, ink-stained fingers) and his metaphor-driven deflection of emotional labor. Their contradictory impulses—Elena’s need for absolution vs. fear of rejection, Silas’s professional detachment vs. hollow ache—act simultaneously under pressure. The ghost’s frost-burn touch crystallizes cost without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as End of History Witness, and her reliance on the dictionary reveals a credible hierarchy of values under cosmic pressure. Her internal conflict—between surrender to void and insistence on definition—is embodied through tactile interaction with the book and erratic movement. However, her emotional arc lacks micro-contradictions; she moves from resolve to resolution without palpable struggle or irrationality. The final choice feels earned but slightly streamlined, missing the grit of flawed cognition under true disintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s obsession is embodied in tactile detail and micro-choices—retrieving the key, counting backward, thrusting it into the air—all revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His interior contradiction (seeking truth vs. needing mercy) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—shattering focus to break the connection—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual weight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through physiological and perceptual degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his spatial perception, obsession with boundaries, and trembling hand reveal a man whose competence and fear are inextricable. His motivation to “understand the physics of letting go” emerges organically from decades of self-imposed rigidity, and his final act carries emotional cost: surrendering control he once believed was safety. Mera remains enigmatic yet active, stepping toward him rather than passively receiving his gesture, preserving her agency. The relationship evolves credibly from “familiar strangers” to shared luminance without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her trembling finger now steady, her rebellion tempered by calculation. Her motivation (widening perspective responsibly) directly shapes her actions and culminates in a resonant renunciation of fear. The father backstory is economically deployed to contrast worldviews without over-explaining. However, the epiphany about mortality lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a prior path; it arrives as revelation rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—“to teach endings how to begin”—is dramatized through precise, high-stakes micro-choices (e.g., distorting the glass disc’s tone to shatter grief loops). His internal contradiction (healer who must remain unseen) manifests in embodied action, not exposition. The woman and old man are vividly rendered through voice-specific dialogue (“thick with tears and red wine,” “trembling” hope), avoiding diagnostic labels. Their anonymity is a crucible that forces raw, unguarded vulnerability without collapsing into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her walnut-stained hands, trembling fingers, and “haunted euphoria” reveal a psyche shaped by grief and devotion. Her micro-choices (tilting the stone, cleaning the locket) align precisely with her motivation to preserve fragile emotional residue. The contradiction between archival precision and magical ritual deepens her credibility. Final renunciation—releasing the locket—carries visible cost: she becomes a “guardian of debris,” not a participant in the joy she resurrects.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arthur’s internal contradiction—logistical mastery versus emotional paralysis—is embodied in every gesture, especially his “desperately jocular” deflection and the climactic toss of the moon rock. His micro-choices (organizing gauze, checking a useless watch) reveal a hierarchy of control over chaos. The woman’s entrance forces vulnerability without melodrama, and his final renunciation (“Play”) earns intimacy through loss. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile, contradictory, and rooted in flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception and linguistic synesthesia, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—pressing into bark despite shock, lunging through briars—reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Motivation rooted in grief and filial longing intensifies coherently under pressure. However, the absence of internal contradiction (e.g., doubt vs. determination) slightly softens emotional complexity at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied: his “confidently uncertain” posture, imposter feelings, and tactile repair of the pen reveal a layered psyche under pressure. His moral burden—rewriting history after misreading cosmic signals—is dramatized through micro-choices (unbending the nib, tracing causal lines) that carry visible cost. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion emerges through action (“dry nib scratching against empty air”) rather than therapy-speak. His flawed competence drives the plot without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—“joyful sorrow,” liberation in erasure—and his micro-choices (adjusting aperture, tracking gestures) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on creation over recognition. The whispering advisor functions more as an extension of his psyche than a fully pressurizing secondary character; her agency remains vague, weakening the crucible dynamic. Still, his renunciation of memory feels earned, and the final weeping carries credible emotional weight without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“volcanic tenderness,” soot-stained fingers, charcoal as both weapon and tool—and her contradictory impulses (destruction vs. preservation, silence vs. fire) act simultaneously in scene. Her final choice recontextualizes Kael’s vandalism not through restoration but reinterpretation, foreclosing the path of passive grief with visible emotional cost. Motivation is rooted in consistent traits: her “analytically intuitive” perception drives every action, and her arsonist past informs her present creation. The promise to Kael isn’t abstract; it’s dramatized through tactile engagement with his art.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline—his drumming isn’t a tic but a weaponized act of love, rooted in grief and precision. His internal contradiction (surrender vs. control) manifests physically through rhythm and choice, culminating in the Earned Stasis of trading sanity for shared eternity. The cost is felt in the blurring edges of Lena and the auroral sorrow staining the sky—no diagnostic label-speak, only embodied sacrifice. His micro-choice to perch rather than descend initiates the irreversible cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, embodied in his actions and micro-choices (e.g., folding the map, tossing the key). His belief that “whispers travel farther than shouts” drives credible behavior under pressure. Kael’s presence serves as effective secondary pressure without overcomplicating the dynamic. However, Elias’s internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses—his calm exterior lacks a visible counter-tug of doubt or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s silent empathy and spiraling calm manifest through precise, embodied actions—especially his use of the dental mirror—that reveal interiority without exposition. The woman’s guilt is shown via physical tension (white knuckles) and breath release, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her transformation leans slightly on abstract realization (“secrets were merely the background”) rather than a micro-choice under pressure, costing full motivation integration.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to “plant forests of second thoughts”—is embodied in precise micro-choices (cradling the king, organizing displays) and contradicted by his hidden gift and fear of surveillance. His internal conflict between caution and rebellion simmers beneath unassuming gestures, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The children’s presence amplifies stakes without diluting focus; their wide-eyed realization crystallizes his impact. Final renunciation—releasing the king as “monument to defiance”—carries visible cost: exposure, vulnerability, irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian and Vane’s contradictory impulses—Vane’s desperate clinging versus Elian’s fluid compassion—are embodied with visceral specificity (“white-knuckled grip,” “grapple of combative tenderness”). Their transformation feels earned through tactile escalation and the scrimshaw’s catalytic magic, not epiphany. Vane’s fear of boundarylessness is credibly rooted in trauma, and his final release carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action, posture, and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—performing joy while annihilating grief—is embodied with chilling specificity through his whittling ritual and theatrical narration. His moral ambiguity isn’t stated but enacted: he carves away memory to survive, a betrayal rendered visceral in the destruction of the wedding bouquet. The final renunciation (“completely empty”) is earned by every prior micro-choice, with visible cost in emotional atrophy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is filtered through action, voice, and object.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a cloud-shadow poet, and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels in favor of embodied sensation (“cold, wet, and diffuse,” “rattled her teeth”). Her micro-choices—extending her hand into shadow, surrendering to vibration—reveal a hierarchy of values that prioritizes aesthetic transgression over dogma. The final realization feels earned because it emerges from sensory dissolution rather than intellectual epiphany. No secondary characters dilute focus, allowing flawless single-POV execution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her colorblindness and aesthetic of imperfection—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice. Her “innocently cunning” strategy with the plant arrangement reveals a hierarchy of values (beauty vs. utility) that culminates in the reed tongue’s deployment. Silas’s fragmented awakening carries visible cost: his disorientation, damaged eyes, and jerky movements ground the emotional stakes in physical consequence. The final smile isn’t triumph but compositional satisfaction—flawed, partial, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s yearning for tactile connection is embodied through precise sensory language and culminates in a micro-choice—mounting the carbide lens—that reconfigures her role from performer to conduit. Her internal contradiction (artistry vs. authenticity) drives the climax without diagnostic self-awareness. Kael’s trembling hands and crumpling expression reveal secondary pressure credibly. The final cost—her paradigm shift—is felt in her tingling fingers, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and the woman are vividly rendered through embodied emotion and micro-choices—her folded posture, his stained fingers—and their interiority avoids diagnostic labels. The woman’s arc from inert grief to trembling breath is earned by Elias’s ritualized intervention. However, her transformation hinges on a near-magical device without sufficient prior emotional groundwork in her character alone; the cost feels externalized rather than internally wrestled. Elias’s motivation remains consistent but leans slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—to map cultural patterns through cartomancy—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (measuring ink blots, ledger notes) that reveal a mind both obsessive and ethically conflicted. His internal contradiction—detached observer versus compelled witness—intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in the high-stakes choice to confide. The client functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting focus. Final renunciation of neutrality carries visible cost: loss of professional distance and entry into danger.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied contradictions—her trembling hands versus jagged choreography, anguished joy at revelation. Her micro-choices (erratic dance, stillness at the pagoda) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: loss of innocence, burden of truth. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion arises through action (“laughed and sobbed simultaneously”). Final renunciation of comfort is earned by prior causality, though the Council remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in his role as a “custodian of endings,” with interiority rendered through precise, embodied perception (“feeling the pulse of trapped hope beating against his skin”). His micro-choices—approaching the shadow “softly deliberate,” offering the stone as vessel—are consistent with his worldview and carry visible cost: the woman will never be whole. The final renunciation (“luminous regret”) is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values—preserving depth over collective comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior conflict—between rage and compassion—is embodied with precision, especially in her trembling hands and the visceral reaction to the chameleon’s color shift. Her micro-choices (e.g., choosing surgery over pursuit) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The shedding of naivety parallels the physical act of peeling necrotic tissue, making her transformation feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory nature—closure-seeker who reopens wounds—is vividly embodied in his compulsive digging and pain-welcoming. His motivation to read scars as truth drives every action with visceral consistency. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring concrete sensation (“breath hitching,” “screaming protest of the moss”). Final choice—to expose the root—earns closure through bodily cost and psychological inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—finding where unused love is stored—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with emotional and physical specificity. Her spatial imagination isn’t just stated but enacted through the psychometric reading that transforms the booth into a train station. The final renunciation (transferring love into the lens) forecloses her personal claim on it, exacting a quiet cost: she preserves love for others but remains its custodian, not its recipient. No diagnostic label-speak; all interiority emerges through sensory, tactile perception.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—freeing trapped creativity—is compellingly rooted in his hypersensitivity to unspoken ideas, and his internal contradiction (desperate to capture inspiration yet overwhelmed by it) drives every action. His collapse and surrender feel earned, not convenient, with clear embodied stakes: trembling hands, buckling knees, gasping breath. The final choice to rest emerges directly from his failure to control the torrent, making his endurance a credible renunciation with felt cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars his peak crisis; emotion is rendered through physical sensation and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is crystalline—“to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners”—and his dreamless state informs every micro-choice, especially his willingness to dissolve into quantum dispersion. His interiority avoids therapy-speak, instead grounding emotion in tactile sensation (“taste of ozone and ancient ash”) and embodied sacrifice. The contradiction between guarding others’ dreams while possessing none himself fuels credible endurance without resolution. Final renunciation—accepting eternal midnight—is earned through prior causality and exacts a visible cost: loss of self-coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—rediscovering the “wild frontier of his mind”—is embodied through tactile choices (climbing, listening to wind, inserting the gear) and internal contradiction: rigid logic vs. yearning for chaos. His epiphany feels earned, not diagnostic, with raw laughter signaling genuine transformation. The cost is felt in the loosening of “tight bolts of his anxieties,” a concrete metaphor for psychological shift. No secondary characters dilute focus; interiority remains specific and pressure-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    The man’s interior conflict—between grief and nascent courage—is embodied through visceral physicality (“hollow space in his chest,” “trembling legs”) rather than diagnostic labels. Elara’s centuries-old empathy reads as lived-in, not archetypal, and her micro-choices (tapping the rail, withdrawing the punch) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on patient witness. The final act—reaching into mist to grasp “resolved will”—is earned by prior causality: his earlier refusal to look gives way to purposeful action only after the star-light touch recalibrates his panic. No safety-hedging; both characters remain flawed yet credible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to understand the cost of safety—is embodied through his nerve regeneration pain and silent endurance, not abstractly stated. His contradictory impulses (desire for escape vs. commitment to witness) act simultaneously during the climb. The final choice to remain is earned by prior causality: the bolt discovery reconfigures his understanding, making silence a weapon. Cost is felt in his burning palms and forfeited freedom, rendered with visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orel’s regal humility and cosmic density are embodied through precise action—wiping ash, dissolving ink, standing firm—revealing a hierarchy of values where truth outweighs vanity. His internal contradiction (power vs. restraint) manifests physically without diagnostic labels. The Pretender’s hollow arrogance contrasts cleanly, but his interiority is thin; however, as a foil in a single-POV piece, this serves the design. Final renunciation of intervention (“watched him go”) is earned by prior causality and carries sorrowful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted in trauma and professional obsession, rendered through embodied rituals (tapping) and sensory memory (“visceral smell of the rot”). His internal contradiction—grief for lost reefs versus hope in their return—is dramatized in micro-choices like tracing the phantom road while witnessing its living replacement. The final realization feels earned because his method (rhythmic echolocation) directly enables the discovery. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile engagement with tools and ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking meaning in chaos—is consistent and embodied through bare feet, opera glasses, and humming. Her “awkwardly confident” posture reveals internal contradiction without over-explaining. The final act of channeling planetary energy feels earned by her established worldview. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure testing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—“to evolve tradition with intent”—is compellingly embodied in her defiance and technical ingenuity, not just stated. Her internal conflict (duty vs. danger, age vs. agency) is shown through trembling hands, psychic pain, and decisive action under pressure. The telepathy trait adds emotional texture without becoming diagnostic or over-explained. However, the final renunciation lacks a micro-choice that visibly costs her something personal beyond risk—her triumph feels slightly unearned emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s trauma and resilience are rendered with visceral specificity—his freeze response, tactile grounding via the photograph, and grafting as metaphor for survival feel earned and deeply embodied. His internal contradiction (fragile hope vs. gnarled realism) drives every micro-choice without diagnostic self-awareness. The backstory is anchored in present stimuli and alters his actions (e.g., choosing stillness over flight). His final act of grafting crystallizes a renunciation of passive victimhood, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—grief over lost artistic purpose amid reality’s collapse—is embodied in tactile detail (“palette of grief,” “stained fingers”) and drives his climactic choice to descend. His analytical paralysis (“Does the point require a struggle…”) reflects a credible flaw that intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation: painting in darkness. The final micro-choice—to step into the abyss—reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over survival) with visible cost (abandoning the surface world). Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead manifesting through concrete perception (“bones throb with… nostalgia”).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motivation—understanding time dilation for dominance—is vividly embodied through his "serene anger," sensory discipline, and rejection of the drone. His albino physiology and consciously wild ethos directly shape tactics and cost (e.g., goggles, UV vulnerability). Kaelen’s calm defiance reveals a thematic counterpoint without flattening either character. The final renunciation (“track the pattern now, not the man”) feels earned by prior obsession and failure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior conflict is embodied with precision—her shivering has “nothing to do with the ambient temperature,” her finger hovers, her exhale is sharp—and her motivation crystallizes through micro-choices under pressure. Her moral ambiguity feels earned, not hedged, and her final act carries visible cost in Kael’s draining face. The presence of Kael sharpens status dynamics without diluting focus. One slight abstraction (“bravely conflicted”) edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “senselessly perceptive” trait manifests in micro-choices like sheathing the knife and whispering values into roses. Her pacifist vow directly conflicts with her bounty-hunter inheritance, creating credible tension without tidy resolution. The final renunciation of violence feels earned through prior causality, especially her rejection of the pruning knife as weapon. Cost is visible: she risks vulnerability to cultivate peace, a stance that actively disarms both herself and the stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s cool-headedness under pressure is embodied through micro-choices—zigzagging, controlled breathing, voicing silence—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her internal contradiction (endurance vs. vulnerability to the lullaby) operates simultaneously without therapy-speak. Motivation intensifies credibly as stakes rise, culminating in an earned renunciation of safety for the echo. The final impassivity carries felt cost: the feral lullaby still claws at her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s interiority is precise and embodied—her devotion to logic, observational acuity, and emotional restraint manifest in micro-choices (e.g., selecting her father’s pen, walking through the proof). Her motivation—to uncover truth, not defend reputation—is dramatized through action, not stated. The contradiction between public accusation and private ledger evidence reveals a flaw in others’ perception, not hers, yet her competence is balanced by isolation and vulnerability. Final renunciation of defensive instinct in favor of elegant rebuttal earns closure with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s guilt is embodied with visceral specificity—ink-stained fingers, phantom lullabies—and her contradictory impulses (desperate to silence pain yet compelled to preserve it) drive every action. Her final choice to tether rather than erase the cry feels earned, not redemptive, carrying the cost of enduring grief transformed into art. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion emerges through tactile detail and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—discovering meaning in vanishing memories—is consistent, urgent, and embodied through tactile actions (pouring sands, using the tile flake). His socially perceptive trait directly enables him to parse chaotic voices, and his final act of destroying his mandala to impose silence is a credible renunciation with visible cost: the ruined art becomes muddy brown, symbolizing sacrifice. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through sensory detail (“colorful anxiety,” “neck prickle”). The choice feels earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values: peace over preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.3)
    734’s interiority is vividly embodied—his retrocognitive glitches, tactile reverence for the tessera, and thermal sacrifice reveal a soul forged in contradiction. His mercy isn’t abstract but enacted through precise micro-choices: renaming the child, venting heat, shielding from drones. The human’s presence tests his aberrant core without diluting his mechanical essence. Final renunciation (“glad to be flawed”) feels earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Barnaby’s motivation is vividly rooted in his synesthetic longing for applause, and Clara’s despair is embodied through trembling hands and acrid smoke—no diagnostic labels. Their micro-choices (Barnaby humming B-flat, Clara pocketing the coin) reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. The final renunciation of selling the land feels earned through Barnaby’s spectral intervention, not external convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal fracture is embodied with visceral precision—her trembling, jagged perception, and whispered despair feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Elias’s affectionate skepticism manifests in tactile choices (the geode, breath-guided movement) rather than exposition. Their dynamic under pressure crystallizes in micro-choices: his hand on her diaphragm, her tracing the screen. The final “willowglass hope” is earned through somatic collaboration, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her role and psychological need, embodied through tactile interaction with the fossil and sensory mapping. Her internal contradiction—between human fragility and elemental detachment—is rendered in scene via micro-choices (clutching the stone, floating to receive data). The final renunciation of isolation for interpretive duty feels earned, with cost legible in her “racing synapses” and reliance on the fossil. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through perception and action.

    Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in a revisionist interpretation of prophecy, compelling his high-stakes ritual. His interiority is concrete—filtered through tactile work with buttons and echoes—not abstract. The final act of inversion feels earned by his methodical process, though the emotional cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. No secondary characters dilute focus, but the lack of interpersonal friction slightly limits motivational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—cowardice versus the yearning for redemption—is embodied in his trembling hands, his refusal of suicide, and his deliberate snow-coding. His micro-choices (stomping the message, opening the pillbox) reveal a hierarchy of values forged under pressure. The pillbox functions as both physical artifact and psychological mirror, grounding his transformation without therapy-speak. His final endurance (“living” as courage) is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—to distill complexity into essence—is embodied through precise, tactile action with the yarn needle, not stated abstraction. The woman’s internal contradiction (palimpsest promise layered with guilt, revision, secrecy) manifests physically as a “heavy trunk” and is resolved through Silas’s ambient perception and deft unraveling. Her transformation feels earned: the removal of emotional layers directly lightens her form, enabling passage. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through metaphor grounded in the story’s logic (“regrets clung like damp wool”).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his “sharp gentleness,” breath syncing with the wheel, spine conducting vibration—all reveal a coherent, zen-aligned character under pressure. His motivation (“to understand why some places resist change”) drives micro-choices: softening his touch, pressing lantern glass to clay. The epiphany about “phototropic to kindness” emerges from sensory experience, not abstraction. However, the final renunciation lacks visible cost beyond atmospheric shift—felt but not dramatized as personal forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his wistful pragmatism manifests in the refusal to save the petal yet immediate turn to mechanical care. His motivation (“to reflect light into dark corners”) is rooted in consistent, embodied action, not stated abstraction. The micro-choice to wait until *after the final petal drops* before moving reveals a ritualized hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture, tool, and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief over the Sun-Drinkers manifests in physical disorientation and sensory overload, not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (stepping onto the obsidian disc, bypassing scrolls) reveal a hierarchy of values: autonomy over archival immersion. The contradiction between longing for the extinct and needing self-sovereignty plays out simultaneously in her trembling yet deliberate movements. Final renunciation of “graveyard” identity is earned by prior struggle and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained fingers, breath held tight—and her motivation (“to find the thread that connects all things”) drives a credible, costly choice: inserting the spiral to rejoin silence and speech. Her ghostwriter profession isn’t decorative; it shapes her perception and action. The final realization—that integration itself is the thread—is earned through tactile engagement, not diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his role as a rogue interpreter, and his internal conflict—balancing competence with desperation—is embodied through trembling hands, nicotine-stained fingers, and frantic precision. His final renunciation of safety for intervention feels earned, with visible cost in physical exhaustion and existential risk. However, his emotional state lacks layered contradiction under peak stress; fear dominates without competing impulses like doubt or hubris muddying his resolve. The absence of diagnostic label-speak and reliance on tactile detail elevate interiority beyond stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence drive every micro-choice under pressure, especially her refusal to flee despite panic—a credible endurance that forecloses escape and demands musical confrontation. Her interiority is embodied (“heart hammered,” “sweat cooling rapidly”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—slumping over keys, then walking away—carries visible exhaustion as cost. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) act simultaneously in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but the engine of his method and moral stance; his micro-choices—adjusting the easel, piercing the pupil, pressing the ribbon—are precise, embodied acts that reveal a hierarchy of values. Miller’s grief-crack is earned through Silas’s work, not exposition. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak even while naming the condition, grounding it in sensory perception (“topographic maps of skin and bone”). The only near-flaw: Miller’s shift, though powerful, borders on abrupt without a prior hint of suppressed personal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “nervously confident” state manifests in trembling hands and steady voice, revealing a credible hierarchy of values. Her motivation (honoring Silas) is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving every micro-choice. The flaw of idealism is not hedged; it compels her into unsanctioned risk with tangible cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion emerges through tactile detail like tears mingling with condensation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—is compellingly embodied through his fiddle, his observation, and his final act of playing into the glitch. His interiority avoids therapy-speak; guilt manifests as pixelated amnesty, not abstract regret. The hitchhiker’s absence functions as a crucible, though her lack of on-page presence limits relational pressure. His micro-choice to recount flutters and then play demonstrates a credible hierarchy of values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—protective instinct versus fatalistic observation—are embodied in his calm sabotage and quiet endurance. His highway-robber lineage informs micro-choices (e.g., using railroad spikes as weights) without over-explanation. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile ritual (handling worthless bills). Final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost in the hollow victory and layoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is specific and consistent—decoding trauma through starlight—and her internal conflict (bearing witness to unbearable pain) manifests physically and emotionally without therapy-speak. Her micro-choice to speak forgiveness, not just observe, reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: metabolizing another’s burden into universal light. The final renunciation of silence feels earned by prior causality. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; interiority remains tightly bound to her role and sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular and consistent—his cursed attribute drives him to seek truth beyond illusion—but interior contradiction is minimal. His actions align cleanly with his purpose, yet the lack of internal struggle or ambiguity undercuts emotional complexity. The final choice feels earned but untested by competing impulses. Embodied emotion (“warlike serenity,” “silence heavier than ironwood”) is vivid yet borders on stylized archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara and Jaren are vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—Jaren’s “anxious elation,” Elara’s rooted omniscience—and their scars physically manifest shared trauma. Motivations are tightly bound to the world’s rules: Jaren seeks the dream-intersection not out of whim but necessity, and his final resolve feels earned. The micro-choice to link scars despite pain reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotions remain visceral and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elian’s reckless idealism and fiercely gentle precision are embodied in every action, from carving sigils to sacrificing his certainty. His motivation—repairing Leda’s fractured soul—is consistent, urgent, and layered with emotional contradiction. The final renunciation of his own security for her healing is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—between his roadie past and appraiser present—is embodied in tactile detail (e.g., silk tie as “costume,” knees popping) and drives micro-choices like brute-forcing the frame. His emotional state degrades credibly under stress, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The flaw of overconfidence is shown through action, not label-speak. Final renunciation (“steward of what remained”) feels earned by prior causality with visible cost: loss of credibility, career, and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—understanding transition through linguistic analogy—is deeply consistent and shapes every action. His interiority blends grief, intellect, and tenderness without diagnostic abstraction (“the verb must agree with the subject” is both worldview and method). The final choice to plant the seed reconfigures loss into continuity, with visible emotional cost: he accepts Aris is gone yet present “in dialect.” Flawlessly embodied contradiction—methodical yet grieving, alone yet connected—drives a renunciation that forecloses resurrection but enables coexistence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied through bronze-flesh hybridity and micro-choices (e.g., tucking the loose bamboo strip), revealing a hierarchy of values centered on preserving wonder amid entropy. His contradiction—enduring crushing history while resisting apathy—is dramatized in action, not summarized. The final act of fusing love and betrayal into alloy reflects his core belief that duality sustains meaning. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile, gear-driven perception.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in his talent for absorbing abandoned hopes—is consistent, embodied, and culminates in a climactic choice that forecloses his former role with palpable cost. His internal contradiction (duty vs. empathy) operates simultaneously during the hesitation beat, not as alternating summaries. The final act of crowning the stalagmite releases his hoarded grief, making his emotional shift earned and specific. No diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany emerges through tactile interaction with the pearl and shells.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his unmedicated perception, guilt, and desperate ritual feel specific and contradictory. His micro-choices (transcribing graffiti as coordinates, mimicking a drowning gasp) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The accordion isn’t just symbolic; it’s an extension of his broken physiology. No diagnostic label-speak mars the emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “cautious exuberance,” the tension between terror and thrill, and her disciplined suppression of triumph feel specific and human. Her micro-choices (closing eyes to read, documenting via afterimage) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation is consistent: she seeks suppressed truths, and her competence is balanced by real vulnerability (the watch’s warning, cyclic reversal threat). The final renunciation—bearing the unwritten letter—is earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his telepathic bond with plants and moral opposition to imperial control, embodied through the “mulberry ache” and micro-choices like reading coffee grounds. His internal conflict—between duty and rebellion—is simultaneous and visceral, not summarized. The final act of planting the seed feels earned by prior emotional and sensory buildup, with clear cost: sacrificing his professional standing and risking empire’s wrath. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is urgent and embodied—her desperation to capture Vane’s “last spark” drives every micro-choice, from brushstroke to psychic focus. Her dual expertise as beautician mortician reveals character through action, not exposition. Interiority remains concrete (“listening to the metaphysical roar beneath [skin]”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The cost of her success—physical exhaustion and emotional toll—is felt in her labored breath post-transfer, grounding her endurance in credible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her stained hands, silver bun, and copper pin all externalize internal history. Her motivation (contentment through release) emerges organically from past trauma and present duty. The contradiction between her role as liberator and her own lingering hurt creates authentic tension. Her final act of scalloping the pod is both compassionate and decisive, earned by prior reflection without epiphanic neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “sincerely insincere” mask and Vance’s trembling hand reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic labels. Their micro-choices—Vance selecting iron chimes, Elias deploying the Cloak—embody moral struggle with tactile specificity. The boy-in-the-mirror moment avoids epiphany cliché by grounding vulnerability in physical recoil. However, Elias’s backstory as “conscience for hire” leans slightly toward archetype without deeper idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s backwards aging is vividly embodied—her childlike form contrasted with century-old eyes—and her micro-choice to withhold the formula reveals a hierarchy of values: wisdom over power, subtlety over force. Kael’s desperation feels authentic, his ambition clashing with his inexperience, and his transformation is earned through sensory immersion rather than exposition. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their emotions are shown through gesture (Kael’s “tight” face, Elara’s dimpled hands) and perception under pressure. The final beat—Kael murmuring “It became the motion”—shows internal contradiction resolved through experience, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, grounded in tactile memory and embodied emotion. His contradictory impulses—between stillness and desperate seeking, reverence and violence—act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of physical movement for acoustic traversal is earned by decades of failed attempts and the precise cost of his scream’s entrapment. No diagnostic label-speak; every feeling is filtered through stone, bone, and sound.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her rejection of neural links, her stamina-draining mist walking, and her trembling unstrapping of the regulator all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her flaws (slow casting, physical vulnerability) directly complicate her goal, and her final choice to restore the keystone feels earned through prior struggle. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through breath freezing on goggles, knees hitting permafrost, and the weight of purpose. Her renunciation of systemic safety for raw, human magic crystallizes as Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas’s motivation—grief masked as duty—is embodied in precise micro-choices: adjusting brass weights, stepping off the pier, unscrewing the jar with ritual care. His internal contradiction (hiding behind truth while seeking emotional clarity) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final realization (“sound was the color of a sunrise he had missed”) avoids diagnostic label-speak and emerges from sensory immersion. His renunciation of fear is earned by prior causality, with visible cost: decades of night shifts to avoid dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hiero’s motivation—anchoring memory against cosmic erasure—is vividly embodied through his ritual with the coins and his reaction to static. His internal contradiction (doubt vs. duty) plays out in real time, not as summary, and culminates in a micro-choice to continue casting lots despite despair. The “quietly enthusiastic” trait subtly informs his posture toward chaos without veering into diagnostic label-speak. His endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: he forecloses hope of success but pays the cost of persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—transforming nameless dread into named, solid forms—is rooted in embodied grief and consistent reaper identity. His internal conflict (desire to complete her work vs. the hollowness of his role) manifests through tactile choices: adjusting gears, channeling power to bind rather than sever. The final whisper—"Map complete"—carries earned emotional weight, with visible cost in the blanked atlas and lightened chest. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, object, and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s earnest naivety and lukewarm magic form a coherent, embodied contradiction that drives every micro-choice—his trembling hands, precise timing, and obliviousness to cosmic danger feel consistent and specific. His motivation is clear and rooted in dream-logic rather than exposition, and his actions align with his limited yet oddly suited abilities. The flaw lies in slight emotional flatness during peak stress: his psyche-shattering stakes are asserted (“a microsecond... would shatter his psyche”) but not dramatized through degraded perception or irrational behavior. Still, his blind spot—ignorance of the door swinging back—fuels the climax credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted and consistent: curating memory to counter loss. His actions—planting photos, placing the glass shard—are precise micro-choices revealing a hierarchy of values (truth over myth, dignity over scandal). Interiority is concrete (“precisely humane,” “soften the blow of the rot”) without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of the town’s toxic legend is earned by his decades-long guardianship and culminates in visible emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict between logic and intuition is embodied through concrete micro-choices—dismissing prophecies yet carrying her sister’s ribbon, analyzing starlings then silencing her analytical voice. Her transformation feels earned because it arises from lived contradiction, not epiphany. The sentimental trait directly enables the climax, avoiding label-only sentimentality. However, the shift from stoic rationalist to wonder-embracer borders on tidy without deeper resistance in the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and embodied—panic “strangling his breath,” hands shaking yet moving with muscle memory—and his contradictory impulses (protect Lyra vs. preserve her trust) act simultaneously under pressure. His micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values: sacrificing his own gear, shielding her view, maintaining vocal steadiness. The flaw is not safety-hedged; his competence is matched by genuine vulnerability. His final endurance (“duty done but the heavy memory of the risk remaining”) reads as earned stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through reconnection with biological emotion—is consistently embodied and drives every choice. His flat synthetic voice contrasts powerfully with the visceral panic/hope surge upon vivification, showing interior contradiction without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of pure machine existence is earned by prior causality: his acceptance of Vane’s blow, redirection of force, and ultimate act of transfer. Cost is visible in the relinquishing of his sterile autonomy for messy, vulnerable feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—safeguarding space for innovation—is embodied through micro-choices (accepting the seed, building the incubator) and aligns with his profession. His internal contradiction between creative paralysis and receptivity to the bizarre drives action without therapy-speak. The final decision feels earned, though his emotional range stays narrowly focused on obsession rather than layered vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is rooted in visceral regret, not abstraction—his silence destroyed his family, and now he weaponizes noise to resurrect lost love. His internal contradiction (mourning peace while shattering it) is embodied in trembling hands and horizontal tears. Every micro-choice—gripping the pull cord, conducting via lullaby—aligns with his flawed, desperate need to undo emotional neglect. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of solitude: he endures the storm to hear laughter, costing him nothing less than his last shred of stoicism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The feral guardian’s interiority is vividly embodied—claws clicking on sentence-roots, fur rippling with pressure shifts—and their contradictory impulses (predator vs. seeker of connection) act simultaneously in the climactic choice to wait. The ache of dimensional homesickness isn’t abstract; it fuels a credible evolution from curation-through-destruction to coexistence-with-uncertainty. Their restraint feels earned, not convenient, and the cost—enduring loneliness while risking vulnerability—is legible in the final shared breath. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through sensory contradiction (ozone/fear vs. stale dust).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his stoic face versus weeping heart, his tremulous hands holding the crozier—and his motivation (to interrupt a stifling destiny through creative destruction) intensifies credibly under pressure. His epiphany (“life was the interruption of order”) arises organically from repeated failures, not abstraction. The final choice—to annihilate rather than repair—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: isolation in deepening cold. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to find beginnings in endings—is embodied through her rejection of academy training and her attunement to silence, not sound. Her micro-choices (discarding assumptions, tuning to negative space) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking equipment failure and personal safety. Interiority is concrete (“serenely electric,” “hairs on her arms”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final act of packing tools with care while pocketing the cooled fragment shows earned endurance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—professional pride fused with desperate hope—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (adjusting dials, gripping the mic) reveal a hierarchy of values: duty over despair. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; her positivity is shown through action, not assertion. The final renunciation of spectral limbo is earned by her persistent will, with the cost being the loss of timeless stasis for mortal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s fever-driven interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, cold sweat, and burning skin anchor his psychological state in physical sensation. His motivation to stabilize hallucinations through sinew thread feels urgent and coherent, though the woman-memory lacks sufficient friction with his core drive to fully earn its emotional weight. The final realization—that connection equals pain—is earned through escalating bodily cost, but his internal contradiction (architect vs. dissolver) could be sharper mid-crisis. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion remains visceral, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Harlin’s motivation is deeply rooted and consistent—his yearning to navigate by starlight emerges organically from his tactile bond with the anchor link and his role as a navigator. His internal conflict between scientific curiosity and existential limitation is embodied, not summarized, especially in the trembling hand passing through Orion’s phantom light. The final renunciation—charting a course he’ll never sail—is earned, specific, and weighted with quiet cost. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional abstraction mars his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation evolves organically from bureaucratic curiosity to protective urgency, grounded in embodied reactions (trembling thumb, cold sweat) and micro-choices (using the photo as a beacon). Her persistent curiosity isn’t labeled but enacted through tactile engagement with artifacts. The final renunciation—choosing to stay when she should flee—carries visible cost and aligns with her flaw of over-identification. Interiority avoids diagnostic phrasing, instead rendering emotion through sensory immediacy and professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and vow to honor the unremembered are embodied with visceral specificity, driving every micro-choice under pressure.

Final endurance is earned through consistent, costly struggle without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his heartbeat count, tactile handling of the shard, and ink ritual reveal a man wrestling with bureaucratic erasure and grief. His contradictory impulses (seeking closure while fearing what it reveals) act simultaneously in scene. The final realization about silence preceding their fight feels earned, not diagnostic, and the cost—wisdom too late to save her—is viscerally felt. No therapy-speak; emotion arises through concrete action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sylas’s motivation is vividly embodied: his copper veins, tactile translation goal, and sacrifice of voice form a coherent arc. His internal contradiction—preserving language by abandoning words—is dramatized through precise micro-choices (e.g., gripping the diamond, syncing pitch to birds). The curse’s cost feels inevitable, not tacked-on, and his silent smile earns closure through renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in grit, hum, and scorched fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is sharply rooted in bitterness transformed into agency, and his micro-choices—pocketing the arrowhead, using blood on the phone—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. His interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains embodied (“stomach flip,” “bile into the electronic hiss”). The brother’s transformation validates Elias’s arc without sentimentality. Flawed yet driven, he reads as an individual, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is embodied through precise, contradictory impulses: her treasonous act is both tender and violent, rooted in her identity as a violinist who weaponizes melody. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile detail (warm wood against skin, pulse in fingertips). The locust shell functions as a mirror of her own fragility and resolve, not just symbol but catalyst. Final renunciation of order carries visible cost: the city bleeds green from its wounds, and she stands alone atop the chaos she summoned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to find where broken promises heal—is abstract yet grounded in tactile action (soothing the storm, threading drone gaps). His interiority avoids therapy-speak; stress degrades perception (“saline stinging his eyes… dared not wipe it away”). The final renunciation (delivering chaos as hope) is earned through consistent micro-choices under pressure. However, his backstory remains too thin to fully justify the metaphysical weight of his mission.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to interpret silence as possibility—is vividly embodied in his calloused hands, sealed lips, and meticulous carpentry. His internal contradiction (silence as tool vs. barrier) culminates in the raw, wordless song that harmonizes with the wind bell, a choice earned by prior behavior and laden with conceptual cost. The final act of pressing the halo fragment into the horse’s forehead crystallizes his arc without sentimentality or exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through tactile detail and resonant action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—finding where stories live—is compellingly eccentric yet internally consistent. Her actions (folding scarf via hyperbolic geometry) reveal a character whose logic treats metaphor as physics. The “sanely eccentric” trait drives tangible choices with cost: failed portal, frayed scarf, emotional isolation. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she’s resolute, not torn, reducing complexity just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—capturing a runaway dream—is vividly embodied through urgent, precise actions and sensory detail. Her internal conflict (longing vs. futility) manifests in physical tension (“sweat prickling her skin”) and high-stakes micro-choices (hand over camera display, stylus strokes). The final renunciation is earned: she accepts transience as the price of beauty. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from craft, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The woman’s internal conflict—between fear and the desire to reclaim her silenced voice—is embodied through trembling hands, averted gaze, and physical lurching during disorientation. Silas’s motivation (“to free an idea trapped behind fear”) is consistent and costly, yet his interiority remains enigmatic by design, not omission. The final micro-choice—locking eyes on the star despite vertigo—reveals a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. However, Silas’s “unassumingly bold” trait functions more as atmospheric label than active constraint shaping decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—recovering his wife’s stolen voice—is visceral, consistent, and embodied through tactile details (soil-stained gloves, trembling fingers). His chronic curiosity directly drives the climax and is paid for with decades of isolation. The internal conflict between obsession and longing manifests simultaneously in his feverish scanning and nostalgic hallucinations. His final choice feels earned, with emotional cost legible in the “cold, dark wait” preceding closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s combative tenderness and Lenore’s silent agency are rendered through embodied contradiction—his backwards retreat masking pride, her shadow-fist signaling resolve. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure: his refusal to “coddle” directly fuels the climax. The final micro-choice—handing her a broom instead of embracing her—reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through gesture, object, and spatial tension.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—disciplined pruner vs. insatiably creative sculptor—is embodied in his actions and choices, not merely stated. His motivation to preserve wonder feels urgent and personal, rooted in consistent traits. The final act of grafting the seed’s essence is earned by prior causality and carries a felt cost: exhaustion, responsibility, and irreversible commitment. However, the lack of interpersonal pressure or secondary characters limits relational depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s guilt-driven motivation is concrete, consistent, and embodied through trembling hands and precise needlework. His internal conflict—love for his brother versus the burden of theft—is dramatized in micro-choices (stealing the net, threading silence) that escalate under pressure. The final renunciation (“his own unrest would never settle”) is earned and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from tactile action and sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “methodically curious” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., mimicking the grieving woman’s posture) with emotional specificity. Her motivation (“to interpret silence with empathy”) avoids diagnostic label-speak and ties cleanly to action. The absence of secondary on-page characters simplifies relational dynamics but doesn’t weaken her credible, costly endurance. A hairline slip: the grandfather reference feels slightly expository rather than fully dramatized.

    Elias’s motivation—to understand the physics of letting go—is embodied in his analytic detachment and micro-choices (e.g., grounding the snow globe), revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His interior contradiction (studying grief while avoiding it) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The “first-name basis with death” device risks abstraction but is anchored by tactile action and earned renunciation. Final endurance—carrying the globe upward—forecloses emotional stasis with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief and technical intimacy, with micro-choices—shaking the canister, pressing the bolt plate—that reveal a hierarchy of values: repair over performance, memory over spectacle. His interiority avoids therapy-speak, instead manifesting through embodied contradiction (drifting alertness vs. razor-sharp focus). The final renunciation—accepting Kaelen’s digital peace without physical reunion—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Flaws like his solitary obsession complicate but never derail his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to seek joy beneath anguish—is compellingly embodied through his micro-choices (e.g., using the goggles as a decoding tool) and consistent interiority. His “affectionate detachment” manifests credibly in action, not just label. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion is channeled through tactile engagement with objects. However, his backstory lacks friction—his competence feels slightly unearned, missing a moment of genuine struggle that would deepen his flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—to prove “empty spaces remember”—is rooted in credible professional identity and deep grief, driving micro-choices like sketching the memory-cloud with trembling hands. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“tears blurred his vision, but he forced himself to keep looking”). The final renunciation—accepting his role as sole librarian of the sky—is earned through prior obsession and isolation. No secondary characters dilute focus, and his flawed hope feels human, not heroic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but the engine of his perception and artistry, shaping every choice with visceral specificity. His tactile epiphany on the coin bypasses visual limitation organically, revealing a hierarchy of values: truth over recognition, process over permanence. The final renunciation—sitting to preserve the image in memory—earns stasis through prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in charcoal dust, trembling hands, and breathless stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—charting "stranded luminance"—is rooted in her identity as a map apprentice and manifests through precise, embodied choices: aligning the dog-eared phrasebook with floor markings, interpreting bird patterns as data. Her "diligently curious" trait drives every action without lapsing into label-speak or unearned insight. The final sketching of the luminance sphere is a micro-choice that crystallizes her values under pressure. No secondary characters dilute focus; interiority remains concrete, consistent, and causally linked to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her role as lunar-eclipse locksmith, with embodied emotion (shivering from weight of title, not cold) and credible micro-choices (refusing mirror illusions, tactile navigation). Her internal conflict—fear vs duty—is shown through concrete action, not summary. However, the resolution leans slightly tidy: her competence meets no meaningful failure or irreversible cost, softening the emotional stakes just enough to prevent a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characters are vividly individualized through action and voice—Jaxon’s grease-stained skepticism, Elara’s calloused resolve—and their micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The ghost Oren functions as catalyst rather than agent, preserving the survivors’ autonomy. Interiority is concrete (“brambled hope in her chest bloomed”) without diagnostic label-speak. However, secondary characters beyond Jaxon and Elara remain lightly sketched, limiting full crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas’s motivation—preserving the feeling of being held safely—is deeply personal, esoteric, and consistently embodied through tactile interaction with the puppet head. His micro-choices (tracing the crack, aligning fracture with clock pulses) reveal a hierarchy of values prioritizing emotional resonance over grand legacy. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests as “bruised awe,” a character-specific synthesis of grief and reverence. The final renunciation—dissolving with the lighthouse—is earned by his earlier calibration, with visible cost: his own coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s reluctant heroism is embodied through precise physicality (“sloppy precision,” trembling after exertion) and morally weighted micro-choices (refusing direct touch, enduring isolation). His internal contradiction—disdain for the orchard versus commitment to saving others—fuels every action without diagnostic self-awareness. The final moment of lingering amid frozen ruin reveals earned stasis: he accepts his role’s ugliness yet finds meaning in silence. No safety-hedging; his affliction remains a lived constraint, not a metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—grief, scientific atonement, and symphonic perception—is vividly embodied and consistent. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through sensory detail (e.g., “loosened grief” softening into “melancholy rhythm”). The chrysalis-handling micro-choice reveals his hierarchy of values: legacy over permanence. Final renunciation (“vanishing completely”) is earned by prior causality with clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s obsessive motivation—to uncover narrative origin through erasure—is embodied in precise, contradictory actions: he “liberates” yet hoards trauma-objects; his craft is clinical yet poetic. His internal hierarchy (truth over comfort, origin over resolution) drives every micro-choice, especially the scalpel concealment at the end, which reframes his altruism as instrumental. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile details like “velvet cloth” and “thirsty” pages. The final smile reveals moral ambiguity without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to “sandpaper rough memories”—is vividly embodied in her agonizing act of chewing frozen remorse, revealing a hierarchy of values (healing over self-preservation) with tangible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief is tasted as “a blizzard of silent screams,” not named. The contradiction between her professional calm and visceral suffering under pressure feels authentic, not performative. Her final endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: she absorbs history’s jagged edges so the fortress may dry in peace.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her role as acoustic custodian, with embodied struggle (trembling muscles, sweat in cold air) and micro-choices (hooking the pinecone weight, manually pushing the wheel) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict—empathy for the machines’ fear versus duty to prevent starvation—is dramatized without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (releasing the wheel, restoring time) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: exhaustion, risk, and physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to archive discarded human dreams—is vividly embodied through her obsessive tinkering and neural self-modification. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile sensation (“trembling nights,” “hands matched the seismic shudder”). The contradiction between her helix-minded precision and chaotic methodology feels authentic under pressure. However, the final realization arrives with near-instantaneous integration of entangled memories, slightly compressing the struggle needed to earn such a profound transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s prism-minded cognition is vividly embodied through micro-choices (e.g., tracing the spiral, surfing threshold effects) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction—between intellectual mastery and physical vulnerability—is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of lingering in the grotto carries felt cost (jarring impact, frantic chronometer buzz), and her competence is balanced by genuine struggle against disorienting physics. However, emotional embodiment occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“latent blaze,” “stone intestines”) over visceral sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted in a world-defining trauma, and his internal conflict—between force and surrender—is embodied in tactile choices (e.g., tracing cracks, mimicking leaf-fall). His “symphonically minded” perception isn’t just stated but enacted through micro-choices that align with his flawed history. The climax reveals contradictory impulses: desperate control vs. empathetic yielding. His weeping at the end earns closure through prior causality, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly concrete—his precise movements, tactile reliance on the basalt stone, and chess-inflected perception reveal a mind shaped by exile and discipline. His epiphany that he is the "sacrificed piece" emerges organically from decades of pattern-seeking, not diagnostic self-awareness. The contradiction between wounded pride and quiet hope fuels his final renunciation without sentimentality. His choice to remain in exile carries visible emotional cost, fulfilling Earned Stasis with geometric elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—cataloging silence through empathy—is vividly embodied in his tactile, intuitive approach to the lock. His pacifism isn’t stated but enacted: he bows to the book, rejects force, and “asks it to dance.” The final choice (inviting sorrow to breathe) emerges directly from his core belief, with visible cost in the emotional labor of resonance. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are rendered through sensory metaphor (“taste of a word swallowed”) that feels character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking serenity through motion—is deeply rooted in her sensory sensitivity and ancestral legacy, compelling increasingly high-stakes choices as the corpse flower blooms. Her interiority is vividly embodied: she doesn’t just smell decay but dissects it as “a symphony played in a minor key.” The contradiction between craving stillness yet living in perpetual sway drives authentic emotional tension, resolved not by epiphany but earned insight: “serenity… was not in stopping the motion, but in understanding the cycle.” Her final renunciation of control feels inevitable, with cost legible in the “anchor drop within her heart.”

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her intrepid nature drives her into the Flux to save her crops—but interiority remains surface-level during peak stress. Her micro-choice to realign the arrow tip feels earned, yet emotional embodiment lacks contradiction or degradation under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak but leans on competent action over flawed struggle. Still, her singular focus and physical engagement with the sapling root her decisively in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply tied to her professional identity; her micro-choices (e.g., careful placement of anemometers, handling the patch with reverence) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on foresight over blame. Interiority is concrete (“imagined the final moments… fighting controls that no longer obeyed”) without diagnostic label-speak. The emotional weight of the patch grounds abstract aerodynamics in human loss, and her resolve to build predictive models feels earned, not tacked on. No secondary characters dilute focus, allowing full embodiment within single-POV constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—to certify wonder as essential—is compellingly embodied through micro-choices (adjusting gloves, scanning the ceiling, pulling the rope) and synesthetic perception that directly informs action. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests as phantom pressure in his arm, linking him to the distant artist. The story credibly endorses his renunciation of warmth for solitude as Earned Stasis with felt cost. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in-scene (only resolve) prevents full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—harvesting insight from failure—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (arranging driftwood, uncase the flute) and internal contradiction: duty persists despite institutional collapse. His epiphany (“build a canal, not a dam”) arises from sensory experience, not abstraction, and his tears feel earned. The final renunciation—walking away with altered weight—demonstrates Earned Stasis with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through physiology (“blood pound[ing] against his temples”).

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Operator’s borrowed personalities manifest through embodied shifts in posture and voice, avoiding diagnostic labels. Kael’s visceral reactions ground his interiority without over-explanation. The Operator’s motivation—reducing emotion to mathematics—drives every action with chilling consistency. However, Kael’s passivity limits his agency; his role is reactive, not decisive, slightly weakening the reciprocal pressure expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s jittery nature is embodied consistently—her trembling, breath like a knife, and anxiety as conduit feel specific and visceral. Her motivation to “coax wonder” is dramatized through tactile engagement with the pendant and her exhaustion-turned-steadiness at the end. The absence of Kaelen shapes her internal conflict credibly, though his influence leans slightly abstract. Her final renunciation of jitters feels earned, with visible cost in physical depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s paradoxical nature—attentive mystic yet grounded—is embodied in tactile detail (boots in loam, hand on hood) and drives his method. Mara’s skepticism and emotional arc feel earned, with her tearful realization arising from observed evidence, not exposition. Their dialogue carries subtext and distinct voices, though Mara’s shift leans slightly fast. The final renunciation of her false memory reads as credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent: her nostalgia, desperation, and sacrifice arise from concrete sensory cues (amber bead, puzzle edges) rather than abstraction. Her final act—merging with the loom—is earned by escalating pressure and internal contradiction between preservation and surrender. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through tactile detail (“trembling fingers,” “cold wind of cancellation”). The cost—her dissolution—is legible, specific, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ewan’s meekness and quiet determination are embodied through specific gestures (trembling hand, deliberate steps) and a consistent interiority that avoids diagnostic labels. His motivation—coaxing resilience from rubble—is rooted in his identity as a caretaker of small things, making his climactic act feel earned. The sacrifice of “a perfect lie for the harsh truth” crystallizes his internal contradiction without over-explaining. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational pressure, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in sensory memory and personal loss, with interiority rendered through embodied metaphors (“metallic taste of fear,” “crushing burden of the answer”). Her micro-choice to redirect the vision—“turning a rushing river with her bare hands”—reveals hierarchy of values: truth over peace. However, the final realization leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“the lie had been a mercy”) rather than messy, contradictory emotion under peak stress, costing full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s reticence and warmth are embodied in micro-choices—his silent observation, the sea glass gift—that reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Thomas’s fragility is shown through physical tremors and flinches, not diagnostic labels. Their dynamic functions as a crucible: Elias’s action directly stabilizes Thomas’s psyche. The final gesture earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “shadowed elation,” electric delight, and manic prophetic utterances reveal a psyche both exultant and haunted. His motivation—to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows—is dramatized through precise, ritualistic actions that escalate under storm pressure. The contradiction between his joy and the devastation he causes (the dam bursting) remains unacknowledged yet legible, deepening his tragic ambiguity. However, his lack of self-awareness edges toward diagnostic label-speak (“accidentally prophetic”) without sufficient on-page struggle to ground the flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his new heart as a “wild animal trapped in a cage of bone” conveys visceral dissonance without therapy-speak. His micro-choices (tracking sun trails, handling the wing with tweezers) reveal a hierarchy of values: precision over haste, observation over assumption. The contradiction between his observer nature and yearning to magnetize stories fuels authentic tension. His epiphany feels earned because it emerges from tactile failure/success, not abstract musing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to hear what trees witness—is specific, deeply personal, and consistently drives his actions. His curiosity isn’t heroic but quietly obsessive, grounding his choices in a believable interiority. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; sorrow is embodied as “gray sludge,” not explained. His final act of listening to the oak’s thrumming earns closure through renunciation of spectacle for intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is visceral and consistent—rekindling a dying realm at the cost of her own coherence—and her internal contradiction (scattered memory vs. singular focus) drives every action. Her embodied struggle (seared palms, collapsing body) avoids diagnostic label-speak, and her final endurance qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible cost. The villagers’ psychic sync deepens stakes without diluting her centrality. One minor slip: the transition from chaos to diamond-hard focus slightly underplays the degradation expected under such stress.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s empathy is vividly embodied—not as a label but as sensory overload that shapes his choices. His contradictory impulses (desire for solitude vs. pull toward mystery) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation: accepting his sensitivity as strength.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his guilt, reverence, and quiet defiance cohere through tactile actions (brushing ferns, slicing bread) rather than exposition.

The final renunciation—accepting fragile absolution—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars his psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her drive to preserve meaning amid entropy shapes every micro-choice. Her interiority is concrete (“quartz hush,” “beating heart felt like a chaotic trespass”) and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels. The contradiction between her empirical method and emotional yearning for luminous truth simmers throughout without resolution, deepening her credibility. Her final act of preservation earns an Earned Stasis: she accepts the loss of the illusion but secures its truth, with visible cost in the extinguished warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—capturing the sound of betrayal—is tightly bound to her identity as a moonshine runner’s daughter and drives every micro-choice. Her "curiously steadfast" demeanor isn’t just stated; it manifests in precise, embodied actions under lethal pressure. Kael’s jagged-reputation grin and tactical impatience feel individualized, not archetypal. The final renunciation (letting him keep a worthless fob) is earned through repeated rhythm-breaking maneuvers that reveal her hierarchy of values: truth over gold, survival over vengeance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skepticism is embodied through luminous skin and internal resistance, culminating in a credible conceptual shift when she accepts her election. Her motivation—to understand weather-carriers—is consistent and drives every action. The final cloud forming above her palms shows earned transformation without sentimentality. However, the convergence of weather-carriers slightly flattens secondary figures into symbolic roles rather than full agents.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation is vividly rooted in his mnemonic curse and artistic shame, with interiority rendered through embodied detail (“charcoal-fingered,” “trembling hands”) rather than diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses—desire for liberation vs. fear of ridicule—act simultaneously during the lock-breaking climax. The final renunciation of tourist caricatures for raw expression feels earned, with visible cost in years lost and social exile. No safety-hedging; his flaw (perfect recall of humiliation) directly fuels both paralysis and eventual breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s somatic truth-sensitivity is vividly embodied and drives every key choice, especially her collapse during the Governor’s lie and her confrontation with the clerk. Her motivation—to recover lost conversations—is rendered through concrete action (deciphering the map, reading the plate) rather than abstraction. The clerk’s brief but pivotal role applies immediate pressure that forces Elara’s trait into crisis, yielding a credible turn. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; her resolve hardens cleanly without competing impulses muddying her final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)

Her seasonal silence isn’t just a trait but a lens that sharpens her perception and actions, culminating in the resonant sacrifice of the iceberg.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Seven’s internal contradiction—between loyalty to memory and survival instinct—is embodied through tactile, mechanical detail (“chest plate sliding open,” “mechanical fists”) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to connect the wet cable despite agony reveals a hierarchy of values: preservation of self over fidelity to ghosts. The “strangely organic” internals visually manifest his liminal identity, grounding emotional stakes in physical form. Final renunciation feels earned because his nostalgia is shown as paralyzing static, not sentimental indulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—listening as resistance—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., questioning neighbors instead of panicking) and consistent interiority. Her calm isn’t passive; it’s tactical, rooted in her thrift-store curator ethos of rescuing overlooked truths. Minor deduction: secondary characters verge on functional archetypes (hyperventilating elder, weeping widow), though their pressured dialogue serves Elara’s method without flattening them entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fear masked as strength, her grief transformed into resolve—and her micro-choices (dancing the cipher, casting the dice) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The father’s backstory is tightly interwoven with present action, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her contradiction—vulnerability as armor—is enacted, not declared. However, the resolution leans slightly toward elegant inevitability over messy struggle, costing full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is visceral and specific—rooted in excised memory, embodied through the wildflowers and salt-crystal archaeology. His contradictory impulses (fear vs. need) act simultaneously during the gravity fluctuation, and his final anchoring via scent feels earned, not diagnostic.

No therapy-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is singular and consistent, rooted in a metaphysical duty that compels precise action under pressure. His interiority is conveyed through embodied perception (“mapping silence,” “hunting fissures”) rather than diagnostic labels, and his micro-choices—selecting dead air, weaving quietude—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on restraint over force. The final renunciation (letting the wing drift away) forecloses interventionist magic with visible cost: solitude as both method and consequence. No internal contradiction weakens his resolve, but this coherence serves the story’s Accumulative lens without requiring emotional volatility.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation shifts credibly from curiosity to desperation, grounded in his sensory experience of the building’s distress. Elara’s ambiguity is consistent and purposeful—her “patiently nimble” hands and cryptic dialogue reveal character without over-explaining. The final choice—to accept the lie—is earned through prior beats (floorboard discovery, meteoric pressure) and carries clear emotional cost: the surrender of truth for survival. Minor deduction for slight flattening in Elara’s interiority; she functions more as oracle than fully conflicted agent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling grip, tears tracking “cold lines,” and the “hard mask of ghostly resolve” convey simultaneous skepticism and yearning. Her motivation (“translate isolation into independence”) is crystalline and drives every micro-choice, especially the climactic act of witnessing her brother’s crystallization. The emotional contradiction feels lived, not diagnostic, and her renunciation forecloses grief’s seduction with palpable cost. No safety-hedging; her flaw (attachment to beauty in pain) directly complicates the necessary severance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elian’s motivation—forgiving past cowardice through calibrated treason—is rooted in specific trauma (the queen’s abduction) and manifests in embodied choices: enduring cold, using the rose thorn, altering a single letter. His internal conflict between fear and duty operates simultaneously (“too cowardly to act then… hand did not shake now”), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of his guilt is earned by prior causality and exacts a felt cost: ten years of haunting failure crystallized into one irreversible stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a specific, haunting loss and intensifies through micro-choices—adjusting pitch, modulating breath—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her perception isn’t just stated but enacted, with embodied emotion (trembling palm, shell growing hot) avoiding diagnostic labels.

No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; grief lifts as sensory fact, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic—his perception of nets as metaphysical structures and fireflies as laborers reveals a coherent worldview. His micro-choices (stepping only on moonlit stones, the precise whistle) align with his philosophy and deepen his characterization. The final act of witnessing the fireflies’ geometric consensus feels earned by his prior attention to hidden order. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar his emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—truth over myth—is consistent and embodied in his actions, from reassembling letters to calibrating the machine by feel. His internal conflict between logic and intuition climaxes credibly in the analog repair sequence. The cost of his choice (exposing the sanctuary) is felt but not over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—arrogant yet noble—is vividly embodied through micro-choices (splicing voices, monitoring thermal maps) and internal contradiction (desire for control vs. awe at chaos). His emotional arc culminates in Earned Stasis: he accepts exclusion from the dawn he engineered. The flaw is minor over-articulation in “cosmic inevitability” but doesn’t undercut the visceral cost of his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—translating lost beauty for a dispossessed generation—is vividly embodied in his meticulous ritual and micro-choices (e.g., selecting specific jars, timing the repair to dawn). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile action (“hands trembling slightly”) and sensory immersion. The “positively wistful” swell feels earned, not sentimental, arising from synthesis rather than nostalgia. His flaw—obsessive curation as salvation—is consistent and costly, foreclosing ordinary connection but enabling transcendent art.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s “logically emotional” trait is embodied through precise micro-choices—removing gloves, vocalizing pitch—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His fear is biologicalized, not therapized, and his competence is balanced by genuine struggle against psychic resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s guilt, embodied in his handling of the clockwork heart and his visceral reaction to its revival, reveals a layered interiority rooted in specific failure rather than abstract remorse.

Flaws like shattered optics become enablers, not hindrances, deepening character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motivation is sharply rooted in personal obsession and professional access, with embodied reactions (rubbing the patch, metallic adrenaline taste) that avoid diagnostic interiority. His lie to the drone reveals a hierarchy of values—truth over compliance—with immediate cost. The final realization carries emotional weight without epiphany; his knuckles whitening shows endurance, not transformation. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to map empathy onto action—is compelling and consistent, driving his metaphysical quest with clear interior stakes. His calmly intuitive nature is shown through deliberate pacing and sensory navigation in the lighthouse, not just stated. The cost of his choice is felt in the receding shadows on his skin and the council’s thawing resolve. However, the prisoner remains abstract, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation evolves with psychological precision—from clinical detachment to resonant curiosity—culminating in a renunciation that feels earned, not contrived. His internal contradiction (seeking death yet drawn to fragile remnants of life) manifests physically through his trawling and culminates in the parasol tip epiphany. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in cold skin, phantom marrow pains, and the tactile weight of silver. His final choice carries visible cost: returning the vest signals surrender to mortality, now willingly embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and the woman are rendered with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; their micro-choices (Elias approaching, her releasing the letter) reveal values under pressure. The vineyard sentinel’s motivation—nurturing intersubjective understanding—is dramatized through action, not declared. However, the woman’s shift from grief to acceptance leans slightly on the elegance of Elias’s metaphor rather than fully earned internal contradiction, risking a touch of diagnostic clarity mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s vulnerability—“I am terrified that tomorrow will be empty”—is a raw, character-specific confession that strips away his practiced persona, revealing interior contradiction between duty and fear. His micro-choices (avoiding direct gaze, weaving sigils, sealing the archive) align tightly with his motivation and embodied limitations. The mask functions as both tool and symbol without veering into diagnostic label-speak. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle under pressure, costing a hairline deduction from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation—transmuting communal pain into beauty—is consistent and embodied through tactile ritual, not abstraction. His calm is active, not passive: he endures hours of stillness as a form of labor. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges via sensory detail (“lightening of a burden he hadn’t realized he was sharing”). However, his backstory remains ornamental rather than causal, limiting full contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a quiet but dangerous intellectual rebellion, embodied through his trembling hands and raspy voice. His internal conflict—between rigid linguistic law and organic chaos—is dramatized via micro-choices (e.g., whispering fractured syntax) rather than summarized. The emotional arc from fear to testimony feels earned, with “weathered innocence” crystallizing his transformation without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s precognitive amnesia is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, eroding visions, and compulsive driftwood ritual reveal a mind caught between prophecy and oblivion. His motivation to “capture the sound of growing older” emerges organically from his flawed perception, not exposition. The final choice to sit amid decay feels earned: a renunciation that accepts entropy as inevitable. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in chalk dust, misted breath, and magnetic silence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—“to harness the ephemeral”—is embodied in tactile, profession-specific actions and filtered through grief that never veers into diagnostic abstraction. His micro-choices (e.g., rejecting a screwdriver, tuning by ear) reveal a hierarchy of values: precision over force, listening over seeing. The final renunciation isn’t of his goal but of linear time itself, accepting cost as luminous ache rather than resolution. His flaw—longing for what cannot be wound backward—drives every adjustment, making his competence inseparable from vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “decisively kind” touch, his disciplined serenity, and his micro-choices (e.g., matching the oxygen drone) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Clara’s whispered “It is still broken” crystallizes her internal conflict without sentimentality. Both characters feel specific, flawed, and human, with motivations rooted in consistent traits. The final act of prying the vinyl shard away carries visible emotional cost, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her scholarly obsession and the world’s broken physics, driving every micro-choice with quiet desperation. Her internal conflict—between discipline and discovery—is embodied in precise actions (e.g., adjusting tension springs while relearning sequences). The epiphany about shadows feels earned, not diagnostic, emerging from tactile engagement with the machine. However, her emotional range remains narrowly calibrated, missing contradictory impulses beyond focused determination.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—his skepticism wars with wonder without diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choices (bypassing stethoscope for bone-setting tools, hiding the tooth) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of clinical certainty is earned by his prior acts of observation and compassion. His “shrewd innocence” mirrors the changeling’s, deepening moral ambiguity without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s trauma, craft, and moral stance cohere into a vividly embodied interiority. Her micro-choices—pressing glass to wheel, grounding herself in saline air—are precise and charged. The flashback is triggered by sensory detail and yields immediate physical reaction (tremor, breath), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her renunciation of fire and pursuit of cold light feel earned, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias and Mara’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—Elias’s quiet proactivity versus his grief for the digital past; Mara’s trembling vulnerability against her world-shattering act. Their micro-choices (offering the pendant, accepting silence) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. The relationship functions as crucible without dialogue, pressure arising from shared history and mutual recognition. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars their authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—creator as destroyer yet preserver—is embodied through precise, tactile choices (gripping the shell, inserting himself into scenes) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. His motivation to collect hope is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses his own emotional resolution. The micro-choice to extract Elara’s hope—not alter her fate—reveals his hierarchy of values: art over mercy, preservation over intervention. However, Elara remains underdeveloped beyond her symbolic function, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in cultural loss and personal history, with micro-choices (grafting the vine, humming forgotten songs) revealing a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile action and sensory memory. The final endurance—singing until exhaustion—forecloses ease but earns communal reawakening, with visible cost in the spent vine and his slumped posture.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—to translate heartbeats into maps—is sorrowfully specific and embodied through precise, costly actions. His patience isn’t abstract; it’s shown in stillness amid biting frost, and his final sealing act carries emotional weight. Internal contradiction is subtle but present: urgency of preservation vs. ritual slowness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is vividly embodied in his meticulous, almost ritualistic actions and internal contradictions (e.g., needing to look away to see). His profession as a “reflective locksmith” is not decorative but shapes his perception and method. The final renunciation—carrying the captured echoes into silence—is earned by prior causality and carries tangible emotional cost: the cavern is “stripped of its ambient spirit.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through physical detail (trembling hands, breath misting) under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and consistent, her interiority rendered through embodied, character-specific perception (“pale fingers dancing,” “boundary-lessly trapped”). Her micro-choice to align the burner with starlight reveals a hierarchy of values—sacrificing mental safety to relieve others’ pain. The fractal-weaving metaphor avoids therapy-speak by grounding emotion in tactile, recursive geometry. However, the absence of contradictory impulses (only endurance under pressure) slightly limits full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s “hauntingly practical” nature is embodied in micro-choices—stitching jackets with fishing line, timing grief to a boiling kettle—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction (rejecting romance yet seeking preservation) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The crystallized-time ritual avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding epiphany in tactile transfer (“chaotic grief flowing out of her skin and locking into the cellulose lattice”). Final renunciation—leaving the blank behind—is earned by prior causality with visible cost: she endures rather than resolves, achieving Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Jaren’s interiority is richly embodied—his chronological confusion, eroded ambitions, and tactile relationship with the camera wheel reveal a psyche shaped by regret and obsession. His final realization lands with visceral force because it emerges from concrete action (winding the wheel) rather than abstract reflection. The ghost confrontation crystallizes his self-sabotage without therapy-speak, and his micro-choice to spin the wheel backward underscores futility with physical precision. Flaws drive inevitable error: his hubris froze time, and now he endures its cost in earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a consistent, embodied worldview—his “functionally creative” mindset manifests through precise micro-choices (e.g., repurposing the sextant) rather than abstract longing. His internal contradiction—between societal decay and personal hope—is dramatized via action, not summary. The final datapad notation reveals stoic restraint over sentimentality, aligning with his engineer identity. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional ventriloquism mars his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trembling, vestigial voice, and tactile hesitation reveal decades of repression without diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (devotion to silence vs. yearning for sound) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses his dream with visible cost: tears, trembling, and the return to duty. The luthier backstory is concretely anchored in petrichor-triggered memory and directly alters his present choice to seek the forecourt. His final endurance (“simply had to bear it”) is earned stasis shaped by consistent traits and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to deconstruct historical lies—is embodied through precise actions (using the sundial, reading the hull plate) and internal contradictions (seeking truth yet re-submerging evidence). His emotional burden feels earned, not diagnostic, and his final renunciation (“Some legends were better left as ghosts”) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The pocket sundial and winch operate as extensions of his psyche, grounding abstract obsession in tactile ritual. No head-hopping or stock phrasing; interiority remains concrete and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation as a philosophical seed collector is vividly embodied through his patient, ritualistic decoding of the rope—a trait that directly shapes action and stakes. His interiority avoids abstraction, rooted in tactile perception (“fingers... moved with ghost-like gentleness”) and consistent obsession. The final renunciation—leaving the rope untouched—earns an Earned Stasis with felt cost: bearing the weight of salvaged foresight alone. No internal contradiction weakens his arc, but the lack of competing impulses slightly limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly embodied—twisting the thread, projecting presence—and reveals contradictory impulses: a desire to heal others while surviving his own wanderings. The Countess’s grief is rendered through precise physical details (pale skin, slowed circulation) rather than abstraction. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior resistance, softening the cost of her acceptance. The final choice—holding the thread as relic—is earned but borders on symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Valerius’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a sterile world—is vividly embodied through his tattered coat, obsessive tinkering, and feverish monologues. His internal contradiction (hope vs. despair) plays out in real time during the hatching scene, culminating in an Earned Stasis: he cups the dying bird, accepting the tragic cost of his success.

The final renunciation feels inevitable, rooted in prior causality and the world’s “flawed genesis.”

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)

Her micro-choices (using volcanic sand, red thread, foreign coin) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied, not labeled—her clinical disdain for her own glow and trust in friction over faith shape every micro-choice.

No internal contradiction is summarized; it pulses in action: she waits with geological patience yet acts with precise leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Xylos’s motivation—repairing ancestral error through non-destructive light—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: his mourning of atoms, naming of stars, and reverence for the gear as a “parent’s heart.” His final act is earned by prior causality, and the cost (obsolescence of his sentimental purpose) is felt with devastating clarity in the closing loneliness. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief manifests through tactile action (“clutched tightly,” “trembling hand”) and perception (“troubling serenity”). The contradiction between his desire to fix and his identity as mourner crystallizes perfectly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to carve the “silence left behind by the dead”—is embodied through precise, profession-rooted actions and deepened by his flawed assumption that grief has geometric order.

    Silas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his ethical diligence, guilt, and tactile penance feel specific and consistent. His micro-choice to use the inscribed rake handle reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost (worn wood, burned fingers). However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; it leans toward monolithic resolve rather than layered tension. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s characterization is vivid and consistent: his blithe demeanor, tactile expertise, and emotional detachment are embodied through action (e.g., humming to ghostly echoes, skipping amid shrouds). His motivation—to discern intention behind chaos—is dramatized through micro-choices like avoiding the knot’s center. The final renunciation of confusion for clarity carries subtle cost in the sigh of settling threads. However, interior contradiction remains implied rather than enacted under pressure, limiting full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—seeding innovation through artificial scarcity—is credibly rooted in his role and worldview, and his internal conflict (doubt vs duty) manifests as embodied hesitation (“hand hovered,” “trembling of his heart”). His micro-choice to write a constrained future reflects a hierarchy of values with clear cost: risking despair to prevent stagnation. The flaw—fear of miscalculation—compounds under pressure without safety-hedging, making his final act feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak mars the peak beat; emotion stays sensory and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is vividly embodied in his clandestine transcription and ritual dispersal of charged paper. His internal contradiction (dutiful copyist vs. rebel archivist) manifests in precise micro-choices: smothering the glow, memorizing coordinates, folding paper for public release.

His renunciation of safety for quiet subversion carries tangible cost, crystallized in the final protective hand on the desk.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas’s interiority is embodied through precise contradictions: he knows preservation is a myth yet performs the ritual with urgency, his porcelain mask both shielding and enabling witness. Elara’s trembling hope and eventual hollow peace feel earned, not summarized. Their micro-choices—Silas omitting rigid details, Elara reaching for the ash—reveal hierarchies of value with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief manifests as tactile, irrational, and layered.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—defending objective time against priestly myth—is consistent, embodied in his obsessive restoration of the cog, and culminates in a quiet but costly act of rebellion. His “abrasive calm” manifests as micro-choices (filing burrs, reciting axioms) that reveal a hierarchy of values: precision over comfort, logic over emotion. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, his worldview filters every perception (“emotion was a variable he could not calculate”). The final renunciation isn’t of action but of silence—he chooses ticking over prayer, with the cost being perpetual exile in the sewer.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted in his role as a guardian of vanishing art, and his interiority—“traveled stillness,” “sorrow of a guardian”—is embodied, specific, and consistent. His micro-choice to conduct silence rather than demand song reveals a hierarchy of values with palpable cost: he accepts transience over coercion. The students’ passive presence functions as environmental pressure rather than active relationship crucibles, which slightly limits interpersonal stakes but aligns with the story’s Accumulative lens. Final renunciation—offering only a “sad nod”—is earned by prior causality and weighted with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)

No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through taste, texture, and action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s involuntary truth-telling creates authentic friction in every exchange, especially his unvarnished critique of Kael (“frightened child who broke a vase”). His motivation—to preserve wonder in routine—is embodied in micro-choices (withholding the box, forcing the riddle) that escalate to renunciation. The final admission about the ash is both flaw and virtue, revealing interior contradiction without therapy-speak. Kael’s desperation feels visceral, not schematic, and their status dynamic shifts credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation as a “creeping normality noticer” is vividly embodied and consistent, driving micro-choices like retrieving the orris root and placing it on the threshold. His internal contradiction—seeking life in dead structures while being hypersensitive to decay—is rendered through sensory perception rather than exposition.

    Elias’s contradictory impulses—repulsion and attraction to death, terror and resolve—are embodied in trembling hands, steady voice, and precise micro-choices like stepping over illusory holes.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sensation (“heat radiating through the soles,” “bones knit themselves”).

However, the daughter exists only as absence; had she been on-page even once, this would breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s pacifism, fear of inherited violence, and yearning for transcendence form a psychologically coherent core. His internal contradiction—rejecting violence while harboring its potential—is embodied in the visceral act of stitching his shadow, not merely summarized. The integration of repressed rage feels earned through concrete micro-choices (gathering tear-residue, piercing his silhouette) rather than abstract epiphany. His final joy carries weight because it emerges from acknowledged darkness, not facile optimism.

    Silas’s motivation—understanding “the texture of transformation”—is embodied in his barefoot walk, his relinquishing of boots, and his final surrender of the lightning bugs. His internal contradiction (philanthropist who hoarded one treasure) resolves credibly through micro-choices: kneeling, unscrewing jars, watching rather than fleeing. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, “surrender” emerges from tactile experience (“fluid and incandescent”). However, his backstory as merchant prince feels slightly ornamental—functional but not causally necessary to the climax.

    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: her three-year wait, the stolen quill, and her calm inventiveness under pressure all converge in a final act that forecloses her old life with quiet cost. Her interiority is embodied (“liquid grace of a dancer,” “fingers curled around a heavy, cold object”) without diagnostic self-awareness. The bronze quill holder reveals her values through tactile action, not exposition. Her flaw—stealthy idealism in a surveillance state—is credibly dangerous and shapes every choice.

    Oren’s precognitive curse and grief-driven mission are vividly embodied, with micro-choices (placing stones, deploying star dust) revealing his hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction—yearning for stillness while cursed to foresee endless motion—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. The emotional payoff (weeping at friction) feels earned, not sentimental. However, the mother’s promise edges close to abstract motivation without deeper anchoring in specific shared memory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “furiously tranquil” state, the tactile precision of his movements, and the visceral reemergence of memory through the map all cohere into a psychologically specific portrait. His motivation (reclamation through truth) intensifies organically under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses fear with visible emotional cost. The micro-choice to pour the solvent despite risk reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through concrete perception (“breath fogging the cold air”) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—to turn questions into destinations—is vividly embodied through his duel-as-philosophy and micro-choices under pressure. His mechanical arm and Danish tin aren’t just props; they’re extensions of his worldview. The contradiction between violence and diplomacy is active in every move, not summarized. Kael’s silent pleading deepens the relational crucible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s molting personalities are vividly embodied—his shift from “Weeper” to “Architect” manifests in voice, posture, and purpose without diagnostic self-awareness. His motivation to forge beauty from anarchy drives concrete action (planting ink-seeds), not abstraction. Silas functions effectively as a crucible: their prison-borne trust enables the rebellion without over-explaining. Minor deduction: the molting trait risks feeling like a label, though the final stance crystallizes it with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—“to surprise fate with an unplanned encore”—is vividly rooted in his “steely longing” and manifests through precise, high-stakes choices (dismantling the clock, rigging the projector). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“trembling fingers,” “heart aching with victorious sorrow”). The final renunciation—accepting transience for beauty—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he trades survival for a fleeting sanctuary. No secondary characters dilute focus, allowing singular psychological depth within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his doubt, duty, and sensory perception intertwine under pressure. His micro-choices (e.g., focusing on the pulse of sorrow over seductive mirages) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, his emotional arc lacks a contradictory impulse acting *simultaneously*; his struggle leans toward sequential resistance rather than layered conflict. The final renunciation feels earned but slightly streamlined, missing the grit of true moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his slow speech, calloused finger tracing lace, trembling effort to disperse guilt—all reveal a character shaped by patience and regret. His motivation (to find “the color of unspoken apologies”) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest physically (sweat mingling with rain, teeth vibrating). His final endurance—remaining still as voices return—is an Earned Stasis that forecloses denial with visible cost.
