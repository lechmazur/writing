    Maria remains a passive observer throughout, with no contradictory impulses or decisions that foreclose paths. Her interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical musings ("reality preprocesses itself") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final paragraph offers no earned change—she simply continues contemplating, with no visible cost or renunciation. Therapy-speak pervades ("kindled humility," "recognition that her own understanding was limited") without dramatic grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.2)
    The glass artist remains a vessel for abstraction rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority consists of label-only feelings ("sense of disorientation," "sense of clarity") and stock bodily clichés without embodied particularity. The final "smile" and discovered purpose arrive without prior causal struggle—no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Therapy-speak ("discover purpose in the pauses") and diagnostic self-awareness pervade peak moments where embodied cost should dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The survivor's motivation to translate stillness into music is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or costly micro-choices. Eli remains a gentle cipher—his "silently expressive" eyes and economical movements are told labels without embodied tension or internal friction. The protagonist's emotional arc from frazzled nerves to peace and pride feels tidy, lacking the self-deception or irrational layering that would ground the transformation. The final parting carries gratitude but no visible foreclosure or renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.2)
    The undertaker's motivation is told rather than tested through competing impulses. His "inadvertently stubborn" trait appears only as a label without constraining any on-page choice. The character arc from weariness to peace unfolds through summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction; the weeks of preparation and years of library work are recounted, not dramatized, leaving no visible cost at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    Akira's motives are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "gently persistent determination" is labeled repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice with visible cost. The community members remain a faceless collective without individual pressure, and Akira's actions (ringing the bell, distributing food) are recounted in summary rather than shown under stress. No internal conflict complicates her stance; she moves through the scene without friction or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria is characterized primarily through abstract spiritual labels ("spiritually curious nature," "deep sense of peace") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her peak moment—discovering unused love within—arrives via the pilgrim's direct instruction without embodied resistance or cost. The interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("unused love," "chambers of your own heart") and the final "smile" reads as tidy emotional resolution rather than felt ambiguity. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elian remains an abstraction throughout—their profession is stated but never manifests in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The "retrocognitively trapped" premise is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied confusion. The character's interaction with the halo fragment is purely receptive; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from their choices. Interiority defaults to generic wonder ("exhilarating and terrifying") without character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The liberator remains a cipher throughout—motivations declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interior life consists entirely of abstract purpose ("heart swelled," "sense of pride") without embodied emotion or character-particular perception. The final vanishing into the crowd forecloses nothing with visible cost; it reads as convenient exit rather than earned renunciation. No credible struggle or flawed choice shapes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's motivation to "imprint the sound of trust breaking" is declared but never dramatized through on-page conflict or choice under pressure. Her synesthesia (hearing colors) remains ornamental description—"soft blue murmur," "rusty red groan"—without constraining a single decision or revealing character through hierarchy of perception. The backstory about her mother's voice is pure summary that does not anchor in present stimuli or tilt a present choice. Interiority consists of abstract claims ("pain of that loss still lingered") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lumina remains a cipher throughout—motivation is declared ("press their ear against destiny's door") but never tested by a competing want or cost. The photograph is captured without conflict, and no internal contradiction drives the choice. Embodied emotion is absent; we get "excitement and trepidation" as labels rather than specific sensory or somatic markers. The ending dissolves into abstract quest language ("secrets," "mystery," "luminous disbelief") without a visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian remains largely static across the piece—seated, shaping glass, narrating—with no on-page contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The "thawing heart" backstory is told rather than enacted; no micro-choice under pressure demonstrates a hierarchy of values or forecloses a path with visible cost. The final smile and sense of purpose are asserted epiphanies rather than earned through scene conflict. Internal state is generic ("deep sense of purpose," "soulful brown eyes") without character-particular diction or embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is labeled "phobia-ridden" and "firmly adaptive" but these traits read as declarations rather than embodied contradictions driving micro-choices. The internal experience remains abstracted—"trembling certainty," "feeling of betrayal"—without the bodily specificity or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final walk into "a brighter future" arrives without visible cost or a meaningful path foreclosed; the change is asserted rather than earned through prior causality. Therapy-speak cadence ("vulnerability is power," "firmly adaptive nature") flattens interiority at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    The oracle remains entirely abstract—no embodied contradictions, no visceral reactions under pressure, only passive reception of cosmic forces. Interior life consists of label-only states ("mildly obsessed," "otherworldly intensity") without concrete micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The walk into darkness and return lack any visible cost or change in stance; she begins attuned to silence and ends attuned to silence with no foreclosed path. No secondary character applies pressure, so relational dynamics cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    Zeta's interiority is labeled rather than embodied—"curiosity," "remarkably composed," "sense of peace"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The looped-timeline experiment is summarized in two brief retrospective beats rather than dramatized with micro-choices that alter present options. No visible cost forecloses a path; the final "understanding" arrives as assertion. Motivation remains abstract; the robot's emotional progression reads as declarative summary rather than pressure-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    The registrar remains an abstraction throughout—"lost in thought," "pondering," "feeling resolve"—with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The progression from burden to freedom is declared rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose options with visible cost. Interiority consists of therapy-speak labels ("the weight of honesty," "sense of clarity and purpose") without character-particular texture. The final "she was free" reads as summary rather than a motivated change driven by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dresser remains thinly characterized, defined primarily by devotion and pragmatism labels rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the marble-polishing ritual is described but never tests competing desires. The conviction that "gardens know their gardeners" is stated rather than dramatized through choice, and the "mended deception" backstory is alluded to but never concretized in a way that shapes present action. The piece reads as portrait rather than character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelin's motivation to prove time moves sideways is declared but never dramatized through on-page conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The touching-the-nexus decision lacks visible internal contradiction or cost; she hesitates "for a moment" then proceeds without dramatized risk assessment. Interiority relies heavily on label-only emotion ("sense of satisfaction," "sense of awe," "sense of wonder") rather than embodied perception. The final change—returning with tingles and excitement—feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Rachel remains passive throughout, experiencing the moment without meaningful contradiction or choice. Her "decision to disrupt the tranquility" by tilting the program lacks consequences or internal resistance—the images simply reveal themselves. The story tells us she's "changed forever" but shows no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority consists largely of vague inspiration and observation; no embodied struggle or contradictory impulse drives action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("fault-tolerant," "newfound clarity," "hidden truth") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The fever-breaking moment is told rather than dramatized with embodied cost. Her method of investigation—scribbling notes in margins—reads as description rather than a choice that forecloses options. The station inhabitants remain undifferentiated props, never applying relationship pressure or forcing a status-driven trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    The explorer is defined by curiosity and skepticism but never faces a moment where these traits create contradictory impulses or meaningful cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("piqued," "sense of clarity wash over them") and the protagonist remains passive—walking, listening, reading—without agency that forecloses options. The final "satisfaction" is told rather than earned through struggle, and no flawed choice compounds before resolution. The character reads as a vessel for atmosphere rather than a mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chronicle keeper remains a static observer throughout, with "grips reality loosely" functioning as a label rather than a dramatized trait that creates contradictory impulses. The decision to burrow is described but not earned through prior pressure or visible internal conflict. Motivation "to witness change without judgment" is stated repeatedly but never tested against a competing desire or cost. The character functions more as a vessel for atmosphere than an agent whose choices foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria's motivation to nurture wonder is legible and consistent, but her interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle appear on the page. Eli's presence creates a structural opportunity for relationship pressure, yet he remains passive; the shared moment unfolds without friction or choice that forecloses a path. The piece tells us Aria "saw the wonder she had been nurturing begin to bloom" rather than dramatizing a micro-choice or resistance that would earn that bloom. Embodied emotion is sparse; phrases like "cautious exuberance" and "ordinary magic" function as labels rather than sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia's interior voice is established through "sensitively perceptive" and her method of "collecting stories walls have heard," but these remain largely label-only traits. The piece offers no meaningful internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; she moves through the silo without genuine struggle or cost. Her final "smile" and sense of "completion" feel unearned because no on-page choice forecloses a path or tests her commitment. The motivation to collect stories is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.2)
    The Oracle remains a cipher throughout—no embodied contradiction, no micro-choices under pressure, only abstract self-description ("accidentally prophetic nature," "familiar enigma"). The stranger is a prop who listens but never forces a trade-off. Interiority consists of stock metaphor ("worlds through the lens of open secrets") and summary assertion rather than specific perception. No meaningful choice with visible cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.2)
    The priest remains an abstract vessel throughout—eyes closed, fingers moving "deftly," no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority consists of label-only states ("his awareness was acute") without specificity or internal conflict. The final smile and knowledge that "his work was done" arrive as declaration rather than earned transformation with visible cost. No competing impulses act simultaneously; the character floats through the ritual without genuine struggle or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    The writer remains abstract throughout—"cryptic fortune cookie writer," "conductor of unheard symphonies"—without concrete interiority, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure. The character observes and reflects but never faces a dramatized decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Motivation is told ("chronologically homesick," "deep longing") rather than shown through conflicted action. No internal contradiction acts in scene; the prose asserts epiphany without earning it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist remains an abstract archetype throughout—"gravity defier" functions as a label rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Interiority consists of stock quest-narrative declarations ("determined to unravel its mysteries") without micro-choices under pressure. The journey through the labyrinth and encounter with "echoes of herself" are summarized rather than dramatized with visible cost, and no meaningful change or renunciation emerges from prior causality. Motivation is declared but never tested through conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is declared but never embodied in contradictory choices or micro-decisions under pressure. The text tells us she "sought a filament of hush" and felt numbness "recede," yet no on-page action dramatizes this shift—no moment where she chooses one path over another with visible cost. Interiority consists of abstract labels ("wonder crept in," "sense of peace") rather than character-particular perception. The ending grants her stasis without earned struggle; she simply remains "at peace" after the seasons turn, a summary resolution that forecloses nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The storm recorder remains a passive observer throughout, poring over notes and pondering rather than making consequential choices. Her "credibly curious nature" is told rather than dramatized through action with cost. The ending shows determination but no prior contradiction or struggle that would earn the shift—she simply stands and walks away. Interiority relies heavily on abstract states ("sense of layered tranquility," "spirit begin to soar") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains observationally passive throughout; her "ethically playful grin" and stone-patterning are described but never constrain a choice or create visible friction. Internal life consists entirely of abstract contemplation ("texture of time," "swirling complexities") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The rope token is handled once and never again, and the final departure carries no felt cost—she simply walks away unchanged. No trajectory from opening to closure; the character observes and muses without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.2)
    The violinist remains entirely externalized—we watch her walk, pick up a bowl, and play music, but never glimpse contradictory impulses or embodied emotion that would make her choices legible. Her connection to "beauty in the unfinished" is asserted ("She picked it up, feeling an inexplicable connection") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The elderly woman and storytelling group are props without distinct voices or pressure; the violinist's final "sense of hope" arrives as label rather than earned shift. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply walks away "forever changed" by authorial fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dealer's interiority remains abstract throughout—emotions are "crafted," "woven," labeled as "half truths" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The "affectionate detachment" is asserted rather than dramatized through gesture or perception under pressure. No credible cost forecloses a path; the dealer simply "finishes her work" and leaves, with no visible trade-off or renunciation that would signal earned stasis. The fragrance chemist never appears on the page, eliminating relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lena's interiority remains generic throughout—"drawn to Sophia's story," "felt a desire to initiate"—with no embodied contradiction or character-specific pressure. The friendship forms through narrated summary rather than on-page choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Sophia exists primarily as a device to deliver backstory about her late husband; no status dynamics or genuine friction emerge between them. The "whimsically attentive" trait appears only as a label in one sentence without constraining any decision.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's desire to belong is stated repeatedly but never tested with meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost. The "boldly sympathetic nature" appears as exposition rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The transformation from isolation to connection arrives through community reception rather than Kael's own conflicted agency. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("webs of kinship," "luminescent ache") instead of embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra's interiority relies heavily on generic mystical-journey language ("insatiable drive," "deep sense of connection") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist's decision to "borrow time" proceeds without dramatized stakes or visible internal conflict—she simply "closes her eyes" and succeeds. No micro-choices reveal competing values; the resolution ("forever changed") is asserted rather than earned through on-page renunciation or cost. The pendant functions as a prop rather than a focal point for character-specific thought.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conjurer's motivation to "understand the mathematics of emotion" is told more than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "gently inventive nature" and actions (toying with glass eyes, performing a ritual) remain abstract; we see contemplation but not genuine struggle or a hierarchy of values tested by cost. The "ambiguous loss" and "buried optimism" are asserted labels rather than emergent from specific choices that foreclose paths. The final smile and vanishing feel like closure gestures without earned causality linking her discovery to a visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dweller remains a noble archetype without internal contradiction or competing impulses. Motivation is declared ("to become visible") but never tested against cost—no moment where visibility conflicts with safety or solitude. The sensory memory from the tape fragment feels ornamental rather than a choice-altering recognition. Interiority relies on summary labels ("kindly methodical soul," "eyes shining with soft light") instead of embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.2)
    Emilia's internal journey is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her "circuitously sincere nature" and "need for control" are asserted labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The transformation is declared across 27 paragraphs of summary rather than earned through a single pivotal decision with visible cost. Interiority reads as therapy-speak abstraction ("embracing the uncertainty," "deeper sense of purpose") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter protagonist shows concrete motivation—obsession with the brooch—and the final choice (creating art) is embodied on the page. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("wryly earnest sense of purpose," "haggard awe") rather than character-particular contradiction. The exchange beat with the stranger is summarized ("we negotiated") rather than dramatized, undercutting pressure at a pivot. Internal conflict is told more than shown in simultaneous action.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria's characterization is primarily told through abstract descriptors ("renowned," "uncanny ability") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her surprise at not foreseeing the pilgrim is mentioned but never dramatized as internal conflict or contradiction. The piece offers no micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values; her acceptance of the pearl and descent into the cave feel passive and inevitable rather than driven by competing impulses. The final "discovery" reads as unearned epiphany—a thematic statement about everyday magic that bypasses the embodied struggle required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains functionally generic throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied stakes beyond professional duty. Her "reactively visionary" trait is asserted but never dramatizes a visible cost or constraint that shapes a choice under pressure. The community members exist only as summary collective; no individual relationship forces a trade-off. The ending declares pride and satisfaction without earning either through on-page struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.2)
    Emilia remains a container for abstract labels ("meticulous route mapper," "analytically artistic") with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her motivation to find the fortress is declared but never tested by meaningful choice or visible cost; she walks forward without struggle, trade-off, or renunciation. The phantom train ticket punch hums to life in her hand, yet no scene dramatizes what she risks or forfeits to continue. Interior language relies on stock phrasing ("trembling certainty," "overwhelming urge") without character-particular texture or genuine flaws that complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    Emilia is established as a "sympathetic skeptic" but remains largely passive—an observer who transcribes rather than a character forced into high-stakes choices. Her interior life consists of received sensations ("felt an unexpected surge," "felt herself becoming more attuned") rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. The "courageously kind determination" arrives as an imbued label with no prior grounding in her traits or biography. No visible cost forecloses a path; she completes her task and descends "carrying with her a newfound appreciation"—a summary gift rather than an earned renunciation or alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael remains a concept rather than a character with embodied contradictions. The immortal's boredom is declared but never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses—curiosity about the fragment appears fully formed without internal friction. The duplicate encounter at the climax relies on abstract philosophical exchange ("I am what remains after goodbye") instead of a choice that costs Kael something specific. Interiority consists largely of summary statements ("the thrill of discovery had long since worn off") rather than perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's internal journey from observer to active participant is present but undermotivated—her sudden determination to "take the risk" and "breach the boundaries" lacks embodied conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ink pot functions as a talisman rather than forcing a genuine internal trade-off. Her father's con-artist background is told rather than shown through speech or tactical choices, and their relationship lacks the friction necessary to test loyalty or complicity. Emotional progression remains abstract: "warmth spread through her chest" and "sense of calm" are label-only rather than grounded in bodily specificity or contradictory fear.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stationer remains a static figure throughout; her "earnestly studious" nature and fascination with textures are asserted but never tested or complicated by genuine internal conflict. Actions are all aligned—she charts, she walks, she records—with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending satisfaction ("smiled, knowing") reads as unearned because no path was foreclosed and no cost was paid; she simply continues collecting with no alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "death certificate error survivor" remains purely functional, a label without embodied contradiction or interior friction. Motivation is declared ("need to understand the texture of memories") but never tested against cost or competing impulse. The "morbid fascination" with the poison label and the act of layering stories are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. No visible trade-off or renunciation emerges; the character drifts through the labyrinth without agency that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    The myth buster is a purely instrumental figure with no interior contradiction or embodied emotion. Her "gloomy cheerfulness" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The climactic "unlocking" moment lacks on-page struggle or visible cost—she simply achieves her goal without any dramatized forfeit or trade-off. Motivation remains abstract throughout, never tested by genuine pressure that would force a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ava exists only as a label ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") without embodied interiority or contradiction. The text summarizes her actions and motivations rather than dramatizing choices under pressure; we never see her sweat, hesitate, or pay a visible cost for her dual allegiance. The final paragraphs assert that "her dual allegiance had been tested, and found true" without showing the test on the page. No micro-choices reveal competing impulses; she moves through the plot as a smoothly competent archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations are stated (document flora, capture beauty) but never tested by competing desires or internal contradiction. Her "inexplicable connection" to the nightwatch's sand grain is asserted rather than dramatized through choice. The emotional arc—moving from purpose to tears to satisfaction—proceeds along a predictable therapeutic path without hypocrisy or self-deception under pressure. Agency reduces to camera operation; no renunciation or trade-off forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia's blindness is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost—she works "with precision that belied her closed eyes" yet requires no accommodation. Her motivation to repair the drone is declared but not tested by internal conflict or competing wants. The "calm demeanor" and meditative process feel like ambient traits rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final satisfaction is asserted ("she knew that she had succeeded") without a dramatized trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia's interiority is present but abstract—"turmoil that churned beneath her surface" and "subtly confident demeanor" are labels, not embodied contradictions. Her micro-choices (tracing pages, deciphering the pattern) advance plot but lack visible cost or competing impulses in the moment. The "fierce determination" repeated throughout reads as assertion rather than dramatized struggle under pressure. No meaningful alteration or renunciation with felt consequence appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tuner remains abstract throughout—no internal contradiction, no embodied emotion under pressure, only archetypal patience. Motivation ("restore shared balance") is declared but never tested by competing impulses or cost. The character functions as a cipher moving through a ritual rather than a person making choices that foreclose paths. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the town stirs, but the tuner's stance never shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("determined to complete," "driven by knowledge") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her internal experience consists largely of abstract emotional labels ("overwhelming sense of purpose," "deep sense of connection," "sense of wonder and awe") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The final moment—smiling in darkness—reads as satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed paths; no prior desire is renounced on the page. The perfume vial's mechanistic pulsing replaces genuine interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains fundamentally passive—he walks, observes, touches a lock—but never makes a choice that forecloses an option or reveals values under pressure. Interiority consists of atmospheric abstractions ("weight of his father's legacy," "desire to thread the labyrinth") rather than embodied contradiction. The line "before they found the bodies" dangles without dramatized cost or consequence, reading as mood rather than earned tension. No visible stake crystallizes into a decision with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ghost bride and alchemist lack distinct interiority or embodied emotion; motivations are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The alchemist's "inexplicable sense of longing" and the ghost bride's "lovingly venomous intent" remain labels without scene pressure or visible trade-offs. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist's transformation happens passively when she touches the bead rather than through earned struggle. The final "mournful elation" is asserted, not embodied through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria remains a passive vessel for abstract meditation rather than a character under pressure. Her "hauntingly optimistic vision" and desire to "carve a path from ruin to reverence" are asserted repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. The interiority consists entirely of therapeutic abstractions ("broken dreams," "shattered hopes," "orchid solace") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. No meaningful change or credible endurance occurs; the work simply completes without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interiority remains generic and stock: "shiver run down her spine," "mind begin to clear," "sense of wonder growing within her." The motivation to restore lost faith is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. No meaningful internal contradiction acts in scene; her emotions are summarized in sequential blocks rather than layered. The final "sense of cautious enchantment" reads as a label without embodied cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Cipher remains a cipher throughout—no embodied contradictions, no micro-choices under pressure, just observed gestures ("carefully transcribed," "stepped back to admire"). The meditative flow is asserted rather than dramatized through stakes-driven decisions. Interiority consists of abstract musings ("wondering what the future held") that never land as character-particular impulses forcing a trade-off. No visible cost forecloses a path; the letter's completion feels inevitable from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    The embroiderer remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle, just serene competence. "Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is asserted but never dramatized in a choice with visible cost. The final stance (narrowed eyes, racing mind) tells rather than shows internal conflict, and no path is foreclosed with felt price. Interiority consists of generic observations ("pondering the whispers") without character-particular texture or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria remains an abstract cipher throughout; her "thoughts consumed by unsent letters" and seeking "the moment before deciding" are told, not embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The confrontation with the manifestation lacks interiority—no embodied emotion, no visible cost in her stance. The healing-in-moonlight attribute appears only as a label at opening and closing, never constraining a choice. Therapy-speak ("fierce tenderness," "sorrow and longing") replaces concrete perception at the story's emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael remains nearly static throughout, with interiority that consists mostly of abstract declarations ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent") rather than embodied contradiction. The child whose cast is decrypted never appears on the page, reducing what could be relational pressure to offstage summary. Emotional progression is told through repeated label-phrases ("deep-seated need," "sense of peace") instead of micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

    Lena's motivation to rediscover lost joy is established early, but her interiority remains declarative rather than contradictory—"She had been feeling lost and uninspired" tells rather than embodies. The fragment discovery and mural creation proceed without meaningful internal friction; her shift from stuckness to inspiration unfolds too smoothly, lacking the credible struggle or visible cost that would make the transformation earned. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; she wanders, finds, creates, and departs without foreclosing a live option or paying a dramatized price.

Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "itch to bewitch," "sense of pride and accomplishment," "sense of peace settle over her"—therapy-speak labels replace embodied emotion at pivotal beats.

    Lyra exists only as a label-holder without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "charming rogue" trait is declared but never tested—she moves through beats with perfect competence and no internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)

The centuries-long vigil and the final slumber suggest change, but no prior path is foreclosed with visible cost; the transformation feels asserted rather than earned. The single-character frame limits relationship dynamics, appropriately, but internal contradiction never acts in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    The caretaker remains an abstraction executing a lonely task without contradiction, struggle, or genuine internal conflict. Motivation is told ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") but never tested on the page by a concrete choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

    The curator's interiority relies on generic phrases ("disquiet deepened," "curiosity got the better of them") rather than character-particular thought. The "philosophical breakthrough" arrives as told epiphany without embodied struggle: "the realization that knowledge was not a linear progression" reads like an abstract claim rather than a discovery earned through concrete scene pressure.

Motivation remains declarative rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract sensory description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "deep motivation to find the quiet in the storm" is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her method (examining crack patterns) and the echo chamber stone allow some tactical engagement, but the emotional arc from disruption to satisfaction proceeds too smoothly without genuine internal friction or visible cost to her renunciation of other paths. The energy beings adjust their resonance conveniently without the mapkeeper making a choice that forecloses options.

No credible endurance or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra remains a vessel for aesthetic observation rather than a character under pressure.

The mosaic note lifts her spirits through convenient external encouragement rather than earned internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    The chronicler remains a static observer throughout; her "warmly observant" trait is repeatedly asserted but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. The two frozen figures provide no relationship pressure—they're props for contemplation rather than agents who force decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's motivation (collecting silences to overcome claustrophobia) is present but the internal contradiction never surfaces as simultaneous impulses in scene—the child simply absorbs silences without dramatized resistance or cost. The porcelain doll functions as a passive symbol rather than an object whose handling reveals character under pressure. The claustrophobia itself never constrains a choice on the page; it's declared overcome by the gilded hush working "subtle magic" without visible struggle. Father remains off-stage comfort rather than a pressure source, and Mrs. Luminari exists only as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria remains a label-only protagonist whose "wisely adventurous" trait is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or meaningful sacrifice.

Interiority consists of stock adventure-quest phrases ("steeled herself," "heart quickened") without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)

No visible cost forecloses a path; the task completes without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)

Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mossy delight," "thrill," "wonder") without embodied contradiction or specific sensory grounding.

No meaningful internal conflict or competing impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's internal life is told rather than embodied—"felt an inexplicable connection," "felt a sense of calm," "felt a sense of clarity"—reducing interiority to label-only emotional reports. The protagonist's journey from tinkerer to navigator is asserted through summary ("he had created something truly remarkable") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible micro-choices under pressure. Motivation for creating the device arrives late and is explained rather than tested: "befriend uncertainty" is stated as realization, not earned through on-page struggle.

The young woman's spectral confession unfolds without resistance or complication; the collector's presence simply "calms" energy with no visible internal struggle or hierarchy of values. Interiority is mostly told through generic phrases ("sense of satisfaction," "pang of curiosity") rather than character-particular perception. The crocodile's tooth appears as a described object rather than a choice-point that tests the collector's motives or methods.

Her interior life consists largely of abstract claims ("felt an inexplicable jolt," "overwhelming urge") without embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The lens fragment triggers no visible behavioral cost or trade-off; she purchases it and proceeds to contemplate it in loops of similar phrasing ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition") that function as labels rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ezra's defining trait (seeing ghosts) remains ornamental—the ghosts watch and flicker but never constrain a choice or force a trade-off. Her motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") is asserted but not dramatized through on-page conflict or cost; she uncompletes her task smoothly without struggle. Interiority consists mostly of observational summary ("her skillfully observant nature drinking in the details") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.2)
    The operator remains a cipher throughout—shrouded, cryptic, mysterious—but never embodied with concrete interiority, contradictory impulses, or micro-choices under pressure. All action is externalized ritual (tending machinery, pulling prints) without genuine stakes testing commitment or revealing a hierarchy of values. The whisper's message is absorbed without dramatized resistance or cost, and the final "success" arrives as assertion rather than earned transformation. No visible price forecloses a path; the operator drifts through the beats unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    The revolutionary-turned-archaeologist has clear interiority and a consistent scholarly drive, but her transformation from "fiery voice" to chronicler feels asserted rather than embodied through on-page contradictions. Embodied emotion is sparse—"burnished sorrow" repeats as a label without varied physical manifestation under pressure. The final choice to continue her work registers as Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual (loneliness, isolation) rather than a visible forfeiture that we watch unfold in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    Erebus remains largely opaque: his choices are described in reverent generalities ("precision that bordered on reverence," "deep understanding") rather than embodied contradictions or visible struggle.

    The alchemist remains a cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of abstract contemplation ("their mind consumed by the task," "their vision began to take shape") without specific sensory anchors or internal conflict. The final act of beginning work is declared rather than dramatized, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The character functions as a vehicle for theme rather than a person making choices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.2)
    The scribe remains an abstract figure whose interiority is told rather than embodied; we learn they "speak dead languages" and have memories surface, but these never drive concrete micro-choices under pressure. The field-trip memory is decorative—it surfaces, is described as "vivid," then dissolves without altering present stance or options. The emotional pattern archiving is asserted as motivation but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible tradeoffs; the scribe simply works, the patterns "shift," and the scribe steps back with generic wonder and trepidation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    The seed saver's "furiously tranquil" demeanor is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. Her motivations remain abstract—she "felt an overwhelming sense of purpose" and "knew" repeatedly without on-page friction between want and cost. The visions sequence lists emotional states ("threatened to overwhelm her") but her reactions are summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "wild serenity" and legend status feel declared rather than earned through visible transformation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    Ember's motivation is established early (curiosity, preference for listening over noise), but her decision-making remains largely passive—she "finds herself pondering," "feels a sudden urge," and notices patterns without genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shift from siren testing to bell-tending unfolds through observation rather than high-stakes choice with visible cost. The final satisfaction reads as awarded rather than earned through struggle, and interiority leans toward summary ("credibly curious," "felt at peace") instead of embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.2)
    The janitor remains entirely passive and abstract throughout—no concrete goal, no choice under pressure, no visible cost. "Spiritually curious" exists as label-only; the character observes and sweeps but never faces a decision that alters stakes. Internal contradiction is absent; the protagonist floats through the station finding generic "solace" and "connection" without embodied tension. The ending claims transformation ("renewed sense of purpose") without any on-page forfeiture or micro-choice that earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.2)
    The recluse remains entirely passive throughout, observing and reading but never making a choice that alters the situation. Interiority is delivered through abstract label-phrasing ("tranquilly perceptive eyes," "jumble of conflicting emotions," "mute eloquence") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible sacrifice occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    The timekeeper remains abstract throughout, defined by role rather than embodied traits or contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of generic declarations ("their anticipation building," "sense of purpose") without character-particular texture. The final "smile" and "eyes gleaming" read as stock gestures rather than earned emotion rooted in prior struggle. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains entirely passive—she sits, breathes, receives a feather, speaks a poem, walks away—without a single micro-choice under pressure or contradictory impulse in scene. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("deep understanding," "profound truth") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The protagonist's arc from receiving beauty to "discovering something profound" is asserted rather than earned through struggle or visible cost. No internal conflict acts simultaneously; the narrative offers only smooth epiphany without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    The caretaker remains a one-note figure whose "brazen calm" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. No micro-choices under pressure appear; the protagonist moves through a montage of activities without visible internal conflict or trade-offs. The terminal diagnosis arrives as a plot device that declares urgency but never dramatizes it through a single hesitation, regret, or moment where fear and purpose collide. Interiority consists entirely of summary statements about beliefs and satisfaction, not lived thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    The skeptic remains a label-only construct whose "academically rebellious nature" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical rumination ("concept of artificial pilgrimage," "chemistry that governed the sense of homecoming") without embodied emotion or character-particular thought patterns. The final "convergence" moment claims transformation but offers no visible cost or earned change—the skeptic simply stands and realizes something has been found, a purely declarative resolution. The entity appears as a plot device rather than a pressure source that forces concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The coachman remains a cipher throughout—his motivations are asserted ("vision of a garden") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or embodied struggle. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; he simply executes a pre-formed plan without resistance, cost, or internal friction. The "spiritual connection" and understanding of bird language are label-only traits that never constrain action or force a trade-off. Emotional interiority is absent; the protagonist glides through the task without contradiction, doubt, or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra shows consistent scavenger motivation and micro-choices (handing the orb, puzzling over the riddle, deciding to pursue the spring). Kael's retired-bloodhound interiority is present but thin—his "inexplicable tug" and "sense of belonging" read as label-only emotion without embodied contradiction or cost. The final choice to journey lacks visible internal conflict or foreclosed alternatives; the decision feels inevitable rather than earned through competing impulses. Backstory (resource war, Kael's body-finding past) anchors but does not tilt present stakes via micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's interior motivation ("to turn confusion into exploration") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The sketching action near the end provides a concrete micro-choice, but her emotional progression reads as smooth contemplation rather than contradictory desire under pressure. The "blessed pariah" label never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Her final step forward lacks a felt cost that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Moonwhisper remains a cipher throughout—motivation is declared ("chivalrous," "sacredly playful") but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible cost. The mission succeeds without struggle or error; no flaws complicate the swap, no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("steeled themselves," "sense of pride") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final "cautious abandon" is asserted but not dramatized in conflicting on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    Three characters appear (crisis actor, survivor, historian) but remain label-bound with no embodied interiority or contradictory impulses dramatized. The crisis actor is told to have "benevolently ruthless tactics" and "cold, calculating smile" without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation for the historian ("to become the historian of small gestures") is declared but never tested by a concrete cost on the page. The alliance proposal and agreement occur without friction, forfeiting earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    The seer remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses in scene, only expository interiority. Her "trembling hand" and "deep sense of satisfaction" are label-only feelings without specific embodiment. The final choice to "seed a new reality" appears unmotivated by prior conflict; no trade-off or visible cost grounds the decision. Therapy-speak like "buried talents" and "shape of home" replaces dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tutor's motivation to forgive himself is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The labyrinth journey operates as a symbolic pilgrimage where internal shifts are told ("felt a sense of peace settle over him") rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The former student prodigy exists only as summary backstory without altering present options. Emotional progression is summarized in therapeutic language ("weight of his guilt slowly lifting") without the irrational layering or visible cost that would earn the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.2)
    The artist remains entirely abstract—no name, no micro-choices under pressure, no embodied emotion beyond vague "urgency" and "turmoil." Interiority consists of thematic questions posed in essay-like summary rather than lived contradiction. The "realization" and "sense of peace" at the end are declared, not earned through on-page causality. Voice is generic and interchangeable, with no perceptual signature or character-specific bias filtering the world.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelin's motivation to decipher the statue is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("uncertain alchemist," "kintsugi intentions") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mentor memories are quilted together but remain summary-told rather than dramatized micro-choices that alter present tactics. The final gasp and collapse show physical cost, but the internal arc from desperation to peace lacks the earned turning point where competing impulses forced a choice with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    The painter exists as an abstract vessel for theme rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "intimately aloof" nature is declared twice but never shown through on-page friction—no micro-choices reveal what she wants versus what she fears. The mirror-cracking backstory appears mid-story as exposition without anchoring to a present choice that tests her freedom claim. Internal experience remains smooth and diagnostic ("sense of peace," "sense of connection") rather than embodied and conflicted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical declarations ("vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions," "screaming tenderness") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The central "motivation" to prove whispers travel farther is asserted repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma with visible cost. Emotional states are labeled ("determination," "peace and contentment") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The vial cork discovery and garden-tending are narrated as complete summary; no choice or renunciation forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.8)
    The navigator remains abstract throughout—"patchwork" is label-only, and interiority consists of broad emotional claims ("pain still felt like an open wound") rather than embodied contradictions. No micro-choices under pressure constrain her; she "finds solace," "feels a sense of connection," and "presses on" without visible internal friction or cost. The ending acceptance arrives through summary rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared but never tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.2)
    The forager's "involuntarily truthful nature" is told as backstory rather than tested on-page; no scene forces them to speak truth with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("unease," "resolve," "fractured grace") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "cultivate psychological safety" is declared but never dramatized through a choice that forecloses another path. The final walk-away lacks earned causality—no prior action by the forager creates the conditions they're leaving.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael functions primarily as observer rather than agent—his "investigation" produces no micro-choices that alter tactics or foreclose options until the very end when he picks up the boutonnière. The stranger's interiority is gestured at ("a flicker of something—a memory, perhaps") but remains label-only; no embodied contradiction acts in scene. The final gesture of retrieving the boutonnière lacks visible cost or a credible path foreclosed by that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Emilia remains a placeholder throughout—"empirically intuitive" is asserted but never enacted through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The whimsical pivot to following ants arrives without internal friction or cost, and the cavern trials are summarized rather than dramatized. The note from her father at the end delivers resolution through discovery rather than through her own renunciation or choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    The queen's motivation to unravel her recurring dreams is declared but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure.

The final "truth that was both wondrous, and terrible" is withheld entirely, undercutting any earned change or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The alchemist remains thinly characterized throughout, defined primarily by stock labels ("scientist, but also a romantic") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. Her interiority consists of abstract wonder and generic curiosity without embodied emotion or character-specific perception. The final "satisfaction" is told rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation. Friends appear as narrative props without distinct presence or pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist remains a passive observer throughout, recording dreams without making choices that foreclose paths or alter tactics. Interiority consists largely of abstract declarations ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied contradictions. The shift from pain to peace at the end is asserted, not earned through on-page struggle. Therapy-speak labels ("chronologically confused," "jealous of my past selves") replace concrete sensory experience at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior is dominated by abstract reflection and thematic self-diagnosis ("her ability to map emotional terrain remained intact") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The loss of smell is narrated as backstory pathos rather than dramatized constraint forcing a present choice. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost; she arrives, reflects, and departs unchanged. Internal voice leans toward therapy-speak ("trembling calm," "humanize the mundane") that flattens character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaito's motivation to transform scars into stories is present but remains abstract; the embodied struggle is minimal. His micro-choices (lifting the lid, closing eyes, beginning to write) exist but carry little contradiction or visible cost. The interiority leans toward stock meditative phrasing ("state of calm," "surge of inspiration") rather than character-particular texture. The final satisfaction reads earned by time elapsed rather than by a dramatized internal shift that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra remains abstract throughout—her "gossip-column exorcist" role is label-only and never constrains a single on-page choice. Interiority consists of generic mystical declarations ("true power lay not in grand gestures") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The reconciliation with Astra is told rather than dramatized; we never see Lyra weigh competing impulses or pay a visible cost. Therapy-speak and stock phrasing ("mixture of reverence and desperation") flatten what should be a charged moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    Aria exists as a label collection ("end of history witness") rather than a dramatized consciousness. Interiority consists of abstract purpose statements ("to unify the fragmented truths") without embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or micro-choices under pressure. The "journey inward and outward" is told as concept, never shown through on-page tension between competing wants. No genuine cost or renunciation materializes; she simply completes her task and returns.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    The shepherd remains abstract throughout, defined by occupation rather than embodied traits or contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of philosophical musing ("what lay beyond the ticking surface") without concrete sensory anchors or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to help her father is clear, but her interior life remains abstract—poring over notes, pondering concepts, gathering insights—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under live pressure. The father never appears on the page, so the relationship exists only as summary backstory. The final resolve feels declared rather than earned through a dramatized struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("lucid contradictions," "clover melancholy") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.2)
    The operator is characterized primarily through static summary and repeated activity rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists largely of abstract satisfaction ("cherished these relationships," "felt a sense of peace") without specific embodiment or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final epiphany ("taught endings how to begin") is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. No meaningful alteration or renunciation forecloses a path; the operator simply continues the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains a label rather than a character who makes choices under pressure. Her "gently thorough" nature is asserted repeatedly but never tests her through conflicting impulses or forecloses options with visible cost. The locket couple exists only as told backstory; no on-page relationship pressure forces the protagonist's stance. Motivation is declared ("preserve the weight of small moments") but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    Raven remains a label-only protagonist whose "desperately jocular demeanor" is declared but never embodied in speech, gesture, or tactical choice under pressure. The motivation—cure for loneliness—is told in exposition ("driven by a singular motivation") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that foreclose options. The final claim that "they would never be alone again" arrives as narrative assertion without visible cost or renunciation on the page. Interior texture consists of stock phrases ("mixture of hope and trepidation," "sense of peace") that flatten rather than particularize emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.2)
    The mapmaker remains a cipher—motivation is told ("journey to navigate the uncharted emotional depths") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interior access is almost entirely absent; we see no embodied emotion, no trade-offs, no genuine struggle. The "labyrinth of sorrow and loss" is a label without on-page stakes, and the final understanding arrives as an assertion rather than earned transformation with visible cost. Blindness functions as ornamental trait rather than constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria's motivation "to thresh meaning from experience" remains abstract label throughout; her actions (unbending the pen, writing) lack contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The "confidently uncertain" trait is stated but never dramatizes internal conflict—she proceeds linearly from finding pen to restoring it to writing without genuine hesitation or cost. The weeds operate as convenient symbol rather than forcing a difficult choice that alters her stance. No visible forfeiture occurs; the ending grants epiphany without prior dramatized failure or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    The advisor remains an abstract archetype throughout—"quietly charismatic," "uncanny ability"—without contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The old man's signing is received passively; no micro-decisions reveal hierarchy of values.

    Elian's characterization relies heavily on telling rather than showing—"analytically intuitive mind," "volcanic tenderness"—without embodying these traits through concrete choices under pressure. The motivation (forgotten promise to a friend) remains abstract throughout; no on-page moment dramatizes conflict between this vow and a competing cost. Internal life consists of stock responses ("felt an inexplicable connection," "spark of inspiration") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final gesture of touching the tapestry carries no visible forfeiture or trade-off that would demonstrate character change.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aria remains consistently "quietly rebellious" but the trait is more label than enacted constraint—her choices feel contemplative rather than testing that rebelliousness under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstractions ("entangled memories," "collective unconscious," "shared dream") without grounding them in concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The treatment setup and her motivation are declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Embodied emotion is sparse; "auroral sorrow" is named but not made visceral through perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The maintenance worker's interiority remains generic across most beats—"thrill of excitement," "sense of satisfaction"—without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. Her ability to identify walks is label-only; it never constrains a choice or creates friction.

Internal life reads as conceptual summary rather than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    The guardian remains opaque throughout, with motivation stated abstractly ("teach darkness the value of stars") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is generic and label-driven ("spiralingly calm," "unreadable expression") without embodied emotion or character-particular texture. The figure's arrival and departure lack causal grounding in the guardian's desires or constraints; no visible cost attends the final moment. Agency is observation, not decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)

No visible cost forecloses a path—he simply gains conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to shed expectations and find freedom is present, but the actual journey from dock worker to "guardian of the sea's secrets" feels declared rather than earned through specific micro-choices under pressure. The scrimshaw becomes an obsession in exposition, but we never see Kael wrestle with a concrete dilemma where contradictory impulses act simultaneously. The swim into darkness and heart "unlocking" reads as a symbolic fulfillment rather than a dramatized change with visible cost foreclosing a prior path. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("insatiable hunger," "combative tenderness") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    Echo is described primarily through external actions (whittling, narrating) and a declared "blank facade," but we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

The final sadness paired with hope reads as label-only emotional summary without embodied perception or a concrete micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she simply experiences beauty and leaves unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    The colorblind painter remains abstract throughout—his perceptual uniqueness is asserted ("saw the world in a way that others didn't") but never embodied in concrete choice or sensory detail. "Innocently cunning" is declared yet never dramatized; we're told he incorporates suggestions without witnessing a single instance.

No visible renunciation or change forecloses a path; the character ends where she began, gathering belongings in satisfaction.

The colleague appears only to deliver an object. Interiority is abstract ("steadily unpredictable curiosity," "anguished joy") without embodied perception or stakes-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by label ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") rather than through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure.

The climactic moment—disappearing into clouds with newfound understanding—lacks visible cost or foreclosed options. Internal experience reads as therapeutic self-awareness ("luminous regret," "sense of purpose") rather than contradictory emotion driving action.

The final "understanding" arrives as assertion—"not just farewells, but a testament to the enduring power of love"—without dramatized consequence that forecloses a path. Interiority consists of stock meditation-speak ("energies emanating," "vibrations of the film strip") that never particularizes this mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dreamer remains a conceptual vessel rather than a character with interiority or contradiction. Motivation is declared ("to free trapped creativity") but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

    Eira remains a label-only archetype—"wise ferry guide" with "gentle persistence"—whose interiority never surfaces and whose choices are all offstage facilitation. The travelers are an undifferentiated collective; no individual voice, contradiction, or embodied emotion appears. The star-stamp vigil and the commitment it represents are told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice under pressure. The ending delivers transportation to a threshold without any character-specific cost or renunciation visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.2)
    The bellhop's interiority is largely abstract and label-heavy ("unpardonable silence," "frostbitten hope") rather than embodied through contradiction or micro-choices. The figure who tightens the piano bench bolt appears without backstory or motive, never establishing a relationship crucible. The reflective mode dominates (~60% of text) but rarely anchors in concrete present stimuli that alter immediate tactics; most reflection summarizes the bellhop's burden rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "sense of peace" reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through on-page struggle.

    Kael remains a cipher throughout—"diminutive titan" and "regally unpretentious" are labels never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist performs research and leaves messages in pure summary; no embodied emotion, no visible stakes that test commitment. The pretender's unmasking happens entirely off-stage in dialogue reported as "gentle rebuke," with no interiority to make the cost of this long vigil felt. Internal conflict is absent; Kael executes a plan without friction, doubt, or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Maya's motivation to understand disappearing paths is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Her interiority consists largely of abstract reflection ("periodically eternal," "drifting moored") without embodied emotion or concrete micro-choices under pressure. The drum assembly and tapping practice appear as activities rather than revealing contradictory impulses or values hierarchy. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the closure moment of picking up drumsticks again shows no visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stargazer remains thinly sketched; her interior life is presented through abstract labels ("awkwardly confident," "renewed sense of purpose") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The stone-circle epiphany arrives as declarative summary—"visions of the rebellion's fervor...began to resurface"—without showing what inner cost or competing impulse she overcomes. No genuine on-page struggle or foreclosed path makes the transformation credible; the character observes and receives rather than choosing with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.2)
    Akira's telepathic plant connection is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost; it remains ornamental.

Emotional progression is flat; triumph arrives without ambiguity or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Amira's interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("branding iron," "pearl of stillness") rather than embodied contradiction.

The photograph's physical transformation (crumpled → smooth) is asserted without dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.2)
    The artist remains abstract throughout, defined by label-only interiority ("crestfallen," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure test her motives; the untangling of threads is described but never constrained by competing impulses or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria's motivation to "provoke an unspoken conversation" remains abstract throughout; the story tells us she is "bravely conflicted" but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her decision to disseminate the letter feels unearned—no prior causality establishes what personal cost she weighs or what path she forecloses. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "deep breath," "sense of pride and trepidation," "her conflicted heart now a symbol"—therapy-speak labels replace embodied emotion at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria remains static throughout—no internal contradiction drives choices, and her "senselessly perceptive nature" is label-only without embodied cost. The inherited sword and her pacifism are told rather than tested on the page; no moment forces her to choose between competing impulses. Emotional states are summarized ("she felt a sense of connection") rather than embodied through action or perception under pressure. The final paragraph's "she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be" reads as unearned certainty rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    The fisher operates as a contemplative vessel rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene.

The rosewood pen nib functions as a passive talisman rather than constraining her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.8)
    The tattooist remains opaque—her micro-choices are narrated but lack contradictory impulses acting in scene. The guilt that drives her is summarized repeatedly ("dissonance of old guilt," "her own guilt began to surface") without embodied cost or dramatized struggle. The attribute "translates baby cries" is label-only; no on-page moment shows this skill constraining a choice. Interior voice relies on stock metaphors ("weight of her guilt lift") and therapy-speak rather than character-particular perception.

Her socially perceptive trait is mentioned but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost.

Therapy-speak phrases ("the unlearning," "emergent hush," "lilac unease") substitute for concrete emotional embodiment at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria is labeled "gentle radical" but never demonstrates contradictory impulses in scene; her internal life consists of abstract rumination ("aberrant mercy," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The tessera triggers a retrocognitive vision, yet no micro-choice follows that alters present tactics—she simply walks and speaks words of rebirth without visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on therapy-speak and diagnostic phrasing ("warm coldness," "tone that was both gentle and unyielding") that flatten character particularity. No relationship crucible exists; Aria is alone throughout, and her final stance feels declared rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.8)
    Echo has no meaningful interiority or contradiction; she is a label ("stage ghost," "synesthetically blessed") rather than a mind under pressure.

The final "peace" arrives without any visible struggle or trade-off on the page. Motivation remains abstract and declarative throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)

The young woman arrives late (final quarter) and is described in generic terms ("pale and drawn, but her eyes shining with a deep, inner light") without embodied emotion or action.

The final "understanding" is asserted, not earned through scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Akira's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("zen-minded," "phototropic to kindness") rather than embodied contradiction. The journey from observation to understanding follows a meditative arc, but the final choice to take the glass and leave feels unmotivated by prior pressure—no competing impulse or cost is dramatized.

The passive, contemplative stance never encounters genuine resistance that would reveal character through micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    The gardener remains a cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses under pressure, only abstract descriptors ("wistfully pragmatic").

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra remains an abstract keeper-of-knowledge archetype without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "brittle awakenings" and "reincarnation memory" are told labels that never constrain an on-page choice.

No visible cost forecloses a path; she walks away smiling with the twig still in hand, unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra remains a function—cautiously hopeful celestial signal interpreter—rather than a person with embodied contradictions.

Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("electric thrill," "sense of wonder") rather than character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The artist and detective are sketched with concrete sensory ties (face blindness, voice as "furrowed hush"), but interiority remains largely abstract. The artist's epiphany about "emotional numbness" and the detective's motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" are told rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices.

Micro-choices under pressure are absent; she works steadily without meaningful conflict or cost until the resolution arrives by contemplation alone.

Emotional progression reads as therapy-speak summary rather than credible irrationality under pressure.

No embodied emotion under pressure; the "heart swelled with pride" is label-only sentiment at a moment that warrants concrete physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)

    Aria is defined by her role and her "persistently curious gaze," but these remain labels without embodied contradiction or cost. The woman's grief is sketched through tears and a tight grip, yet no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or genuine struggle—her acceptance arrives without visible trade-off. The hearing aid device and Aria's method are told rather than dramatized through consequential action, leaving motivation abstract and unmotivated by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's "claustrophobic spelunker" trait creates a logical inconsistency that undermines motivation clarity—claustrophobia typically means fear of enclosed spaces, yet she "navigates dark, cramped corridors with ease." Her stated motivation "to stand by the unremembered" arrives as backstory assertion without prior dramatization or internal conflict. The ability to "track invisible things" remains label-only; no on-page choice demonstrates this trait under pressure. Emotional states are largely summary ("felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.2)
    Akira's motivation ("death certificate error survivor," seeking to understand a digital ghost) is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or embodied pressure. The interiority relies on abstract phrasing—"sense of midnight solace," "inexplicable urge"—rather than specific, character-particular perception. The final act (letting the shard slip) reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost that forecloses a path; no prior choice makes this renunciation inevitable. Emotional progression is linear and lacks the messiness of genuine decision under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.2)
    The copper-veined storyteller remains entirely static—a vessel for observation rather than a character making choices under pressure. No internal contradiction appears; the protagonist simply watches birds, seeks patterns, and creates sound without any visible cost, renunciation, or foreclosed path. The "quietly articulate" trait functions as decorative labeling rather than a constraint that shapes action. Motivation is asserted ("urgency to capture") but never tested by competing wants or material limits.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lena's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("gravitationally playful nature," "quirky sense of humor") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is told repeatedly but never shown through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The herbalist remains a wispy cipher without distinct pressure. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the protagonist observes and receives rather than deciding under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    Luna is defined solely by her external role and mission statement—"to bring back the vibrancy of life"—without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The statues transition instantly from stone to human with no felt cost or individual resistance; their gratitude is generic. The locust shell is held throughout but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("the key to breaking free") rather than lived, contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    The mailman remains a cipher throughout; his "respectfully rebellious" trait is asserted but never dramatizes contradictory impulses in action. Motivation ("find where broken promises heal") is abstract and declared rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The shadowy recipient offers no relationship crucible, and the protagonist's internal experience remains generic—no embodied emotion or character-particular perception that would distinguish this voice from placeholder prose. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carpenter's "quietly persistent" nature is asserted rather than shown through difficult micro-choices. Interior life remains generic—"thoughts turned to," "curiosity piqued"—without contradictory impulses or embodied stress. The decision to follow the singer lacks visible cost or trade-off; the return to work feels inevitable rather than earned. The singer's ambiguous reality is posed but never forces the carpenter into a stance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    The librarian remains a type rather than an individual: "sanely eccentric" functions as a label without embodied contradiction or on-page friction. Interiority consists largely of abstract declarations ("believed that stories...were living, breathing entities") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The "reawakening" itself—the pivotal choice—is told through summary ("her work done") rather than dramatized decision-making. Embodied emotion is absent; the scarf "glows" and "shimmers" externally while the character's internal state remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian remains a vehicle for atmosphere rather than a character with contradictory impulses. The "cipher of longing" and "runaway dream" are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. Motivation is told through abstract longing without embodied stakes or visible cost that forecloses a path. The repetitive ritual lacks any moment where Elian's flaws or limits create friction that compounds before the non-resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under visible pressure. Interiority consists of generic motivational labels ("curiosity and determination," "improbable longing") rather than character-particular texture. The final act of freeing the lock yields "satisfaction and wonder" but no felt cost or foreclosed path; the protagonist glides through the task without genuine struggle or trade-off. Agency is present but unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.2)
    Emilia's interiority relies on abstract labels ("chronically curious," "fierce determination") rather than embodied contradiction. Her goal to "recover stolen memories" is asserted but never dramatized through a difficult choice with cost—she simply wades, picks a mushroom, and walks away. The final resolve ("She was ready") substitutes declaration for earned change. No on-page action forecloses a path or reveals competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    The archivist is characterized primarily through decorative attributes (brown eyes "holding sorrow," the backwards-walking habit) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies on abstract labels—"combative tenderness," "fierce protectiveness"—without embodied perception or micro-choices under pressure. The final "quiet triumph" and smile feel asserted rather than earned through prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. The walking-backwards trait is mentioned twice but never constrains an on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Aria remains a stock fantasy archetype without internal contradiction or embodied emotion. Her "insatiably creative spirit" is told but never shown constraining a choice or creating visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.8)

Interior experience consists largely of mood and atmosphere rather than embodied, contradictory emotion during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eli's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through pressure-driven choices. The "delicate, quietly analytic mind" attribution remains label-only; no on-page action tests analytical method against emotional stakes. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("physics of letting go") without embodied contradiction or a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending shift feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    The balladeer remains a passive observer for most of the story, watching and pondering rather than making choices that alter her situation. Her interior life consists of vague "wonder" and generic contemplation without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The final departure reads as unmotivated wandering rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Her picking up the bolt plate and creating graffiti are actions, but they lack the internal conflict and stakes-driven motivation required to anchor characterization in the mid-band or higher.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a vessel for exposition rather than an agent under pressure.

The ending's "sense of peace" arrives unearned, a declared epiphany without prior causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    The face-blind portrait artist is established early with fractally precise skill, but their motivation ("to mirror the sky inside walls") remains abstract and doesn't generate meaningful internal conflict or on-page choice friction. The character acts with consistent reverence and absorption, yet no contradictory impulses appear in scene—they work, discover, interpret, and depart in smooth sequence without visible cost to the final departure. The closing act of gathering belongings and leaving reads as contemplative transit rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's interiority is present but largely label-driven ("diligently curious nature kicked in," "absorbed expression").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of repair") remains abstract throughout; no micro-choices under pressure translate this desire into embodied contradiction or cost. The interiority relies heavily on filter verbs and generic phrases ("deep shade of indigo," "quiet resolve," "sense of peace") that assert states rather than dramatize conflicting impulses. The protagonist observes and absorbs without internal friction or any foreclosed path—by the ending Kael simply "knew" their craft, an unearned epiphany with no visible struggle or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria remains largely observational despite being framed as the protagonist; her "altruistic ghost" status is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The settlers as a collective lack individual voice or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Lyra appears briefly but never acts under pressure, and the "strangely trustworthy" attribute is asserted without dramatized cost or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The adjuster remains abstract—no embodied contradiction, no micro-choices under visible cost. Interiority is label-heavy: "burden of bruised awe," "deep-seated need" without grounded perception or action. The puppet head functions as static symbol rather than catalyst for on-page struggle. Agency reduces to performed reverence; no foreclosed path with felt cost appears.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.8)
    The caretaker's motivation remains abstract throughout; we never see her internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. The "sudden surge of determination" from holding a nut is unearned, and the final satisfaction feels declared rather than embodied. The mechanical birds watch "with cold, unblinking eyes" but never create genuine threat or force difficult choices. No visible cost attends her success—the work simply completes, travelers appear, and she smiles.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maria's grief and scientific work are clearly motivated, but her emotional arc moves too smoothly from pain to renewal without genuine contradiction or cost.

The critical moment where she hesitates before incising the bottle shows potential internal conflict, but her pivot to "quantifying absence" reads as intellectual concept rather than felt struggle.

Therapy-speak phrases like "mindfully scattered" and "sense of clarity emerged" flatten what should be charged moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's ability to taste memories is established but never constrains her choices in pivotal moments—she moves through the fortress, approaches the pavilion, and absorbs remorse without visible cost or trade-off shaping her decisions. The "emotionally contagious through touch" trait appears only as label in two beats (sand, coral) without altering tactics or forecloses options. Internal contradiction is absent; the character arc (resilient healer) reads as summary rather than dramatized struggle with on-page micro-choices under pressure. Backstory and reflection ("She believed…", "Elara's motivation was…") occupy ~25% without anchoring to present micro-choices that tilt stance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)

The protagonist acts on their craft but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; the work proceeds smoothly from analysis to strumming without friction.

However, some moments lean toward told rather than shown, slightly reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; emotions are stated rather than shown through specific physicality, such as "heart swelled with excitement and trepidation" feeling tell-y. Micro-choices under pressure are present but not deeply conflicted, limiting emotional complexity. The final choice to open the box is earned, but cost is lightly felt, keeping it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sentimentalist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority expressed through cosmic imagery.

    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown through his agonizing over narratives.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Emilia's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with embodied emotion and credible endurance. However, some telling phrases like "Her motivation was clear" slightly reduce interiority depth, and no contradictory impulses act in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The statue's telepathy and kindness are clear, but it lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; motivation is passive, with revelations feeling externally triggered by the ampoule rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with the protagonist's grim optimism driving endurance. However, motivation to "capture the texture of a missed opportunity" remains abstract, told rather than fully dramatized through choices, weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in her sparkling eyes and historically oriented mind, but lacks contradictory impulses or deep internal conflict under pressure. Her final purpose is earned through the thawing revelation, but the cost is more thematic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like "fingers itched to touch it," but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The change is earned through active puzzle-solving, yet the character's flawlessness limits complexity. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but the absence of significant blind spots reduces authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by morbid curiosity and guided by the whispering advisor. Interiority is present but relies on some stock phrasing like "unsettling connection," and internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The surveyor's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority ("sense of interlaced absence," "heart burned with a hushed blaze") and micro-choices under pressure (retrieving the inkwell, placing notes). However, the character leans slightly passive, with limited contradictory impulses acting in scene, though the final endurance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation to trace origins is clear and consistent, driving her deciphering and hypothesis shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaito's motivation to transform grief is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like polishing glass and folding cranes. Contradictory impulses of solace and torment act simultaneously, and the final release of the crane is earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, some emotional descriptions like "luminous torment" edge toward abstract labeling, slightly reducing concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Amira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion in key beats like clutching the crystal. However, her emotional progression from numbness to determination feels somewhat tidy and rushed, lacking deeper internal contradiction under pressure. Dr. Patel applies secondary pressure, but Amira's choices, while compelling, could benefit from more nuanced micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her search, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; "furiously tranquil" effectively shows contradictory impulses. The poet's motivation to understand her scars drives the narrative, and her decision to open the envelope is earned by prior reflection, with visible cost in her newfound peace. However, some abstraction in "cartography of scars" slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aurélien's motivation and interiority are clear, with the mechanical arm and philosophical drive integrated, but the "diplomatically fierce" attribute is more told than shown, and internal conflict is minimal, reducing depth.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maria is clear as a contemplative, scientifically minded protagonist, and her leave of absence plus fascination with patterns feel consistent. However, she faces virtually no on-page pressure or conflicting impulses; her “arc” is more confirmation than transformation. Emotional states are mostly labeled (“felt a sense of kindled humility”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final stance costs her nothing tangible, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.5)
    The artist’s core motives—uncovering family secrets and reorienting her craft—are clear, but mostly told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her emotions are generalized (“sense of clarity,” “peace settle within”) with little embodied specificity or contradiction under pressure. The survival of the prior attempt is mentioned but never really complicates her present reactions. The final shift into “guardian of her family’s legacy” feels thematically appropriate but earned more by assertion than by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    The survivor’s core motive—to make music from post-catastrophe silence—is clear and consistent, and Eli’s wordless focus complements it. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or genuine pressure on her values; she moves from frazzled to peaceful without any real struggle. Emotional states are more labeled than deeply embodied, and her identity as a “capsize survivor” never meaningfully shapes on-page choices. The relationship with Eli is warm but low-friction, so it never quite functions as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The undertaker’s core desire (to give rest a “permanent address”) is clear and consistent, and his choice to descend and then remain as guardian tracks with that. However, his interiority is largely summarized in abstract terms (“felt a sense of peace,” “weariness lifting”) rather than embodied, character-specific perception. The “inadvertently stubborn” trait is told, not dramatized in a way that constrains or complicates choices. His final state of peace feels more declared than earned via visible internal conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Akira is clearly sketched as a determined, caring leader, but her motivation is almost entirely stated rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices. We’re told she is “gently persistent” and does midnight food runs, yet we never see her pushed into a conflicted moment that tests or complicates that trait. Emotional states lean generic (pride, hope, determination) with little contradiction or specificity. The final stance feels more like a restatement of who she already is than a change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria has a clear spiritual curiosity and longing (“to find where unused love was stored”), and her attachment to Kwan Yin’s Tear gives her a concrete emotional anchor. However, her internal life leans on generalized language (“deep sense of peace,” “newfound understanding”) rather than embodied, character-specific reactions, which flattens her. The pilgrim is more a function than a person, exerting little individuated pressure. Her final shift toward peace and self-acceptance is motivated but comes a bit too easily, without visible ambivalence or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elian has a clear vocation and goal, and the curiosity/trepidation mix is a decent start, but their inner life never deepens beyond stated wonder and determination. The “metaphysical odyssey” is told rather than dramatized through conflicted impulses or costly choices. There’s no real moment where competing values pull Elian apart or where a decision visibly costs them something. The closing choice to “weave its secrets into their next hedge maze” feels intellectually motivated but not emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.0)
    The liberator’s goal (protecting and distributing the seeds) is clear and consistent, but interiority remains generic and largely summarized (“heart swelled with purpose”). There is almost no on-page internal conflict or contradiction; they never doubt, hesitate, or misjudge. Emotional experience is labeled rather than embodied, which flattens the character into an allegorical figure. The closing “legacy” framing further abstracts them from lived, specific personhood.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra’s basic motivation (to capture “the sound of trust breaking” as a tool for healing) is clear and consistent, and her synesthetic perception gives her some individuality. However, interiority stays mostly on a single note of quiet longing and gentle pain; we get little contradiction, ambivalence, or real struggle around what she’s doing. Her grief over her mother is told rather than dramatized in a way that forces a present-tense choice, so the final sense of peace feels lightly earned. Without on-page pressure or a renunciation, her arc reads more as a descriptive state than a change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lumina’s motives (capture “illuminated moments,” follow destiny’s whispers) are clear but remain abstract and untested, so we learn little about them beyond labels. Interiority is largely generalized awe rather than concrete, idiosyncratic thought or embodied feeling. There is no real internal contradiction or difficult choice; Lumina simply notices, decodes, photographs, takes the jar, and leaves. As a result, the ending “one step closer” sensation feels unearned because we have not seen any real cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian has clear traits (contemplative, purposeful) and a defined motivation, and the glassblowing action aligns with their reflective temperament. However, internal conflict is almost absent: their “thawing heart” is asserted more than dramatized, and we rarely see contradictory impulses in tension. The decision to “abandon the familiar and venture into the unknown” feels pre-decided rather than wrestled with on the page. Emotional states are largely summarized rather than embodied in concrete, idiosyncratic reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core contradiction—phobia-ridden stunt double masking fear with competence—is promising and coherent, and his drive to decode the message tracks with that setup. However, emotions are often labeled rather than embodied (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive nature,” “desire to prove that vulnerability is power”), flattening what could be messier internal conflict. The final shift from anxious searching to confident resolve feels somewhat tidy and under-costed, given the supposed depth of his betrayal and fear. More specific, irrational, or self-sabotaging impulses in the moment would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The oracle’s core desire—to map the endless night via silence—is clear and consistent, and her choices (to listen, to speak, to step out, to return) track with it. However, interiority remains generic and reverent rather than character-specific, so she reads more as an archetypal mystic than an individual. There’s almost no contradictory impulse or real emotional friction; she never doubts, resists, or pays a visible price. The final “change” feels more like the world conforming to her will than a hard-earned personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zeta has a clear motive (curiosity about its own thoughts) and a gentle arc toward understanding, but this is conveyed mostly in summary rather than embodied in specific, pressured choices. The "looped timelines" and the moment of seeing the violin shattered are told about, not lived through, which flattens emotional texture. Its "remarkably composed" nature is asserted rather than dramatized via conflicting impulses or cost. The final realization feels somewhat declarative instead of earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The registrar’s basic motivation (“to thaw mistrust with transparency”) is clear and consistent, but it’s told to us rather than dramatized through hard choices or relational pressure. Her emotional life is generalized—“mistrust,” “secrecy,” “peace,” “clarity”—with little concrete embodiment or contradiction. The shift from burdened to “freed by honesty” feels more declared than earned because we never see a specific lie, risk, or personal cost on the page. The result is a coherent but somewhat flat interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dresser’s outward devotion, age, and ritual with the marbles create a coherent, if archetypal, figure with clear stated motives. However, their internal life remains largely summarized rather than dramatized in specific contradictory impulses or difficult choices. We’re told about a “mended deception” and a need to prove gardens know their gardeners, but we never see these tensions tested on the page. The final peace feels more asserted than earned through visible, pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kaelin has a clear, consistent motivation (to prove her sideways-time theory) and some embodied detail (“mechanically warm hands”), but she faces little genuine inner conflict or cost. Her decision to touch the nexus comes with almost no hesitation, fear, or competing impulse, which flattens the decisive moment. Emotional texture trends to generalized awe rather than character-specific contradiction. The final “new sense of purpose” feels under-struggled for given how smoothly everything works out.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rachel’s motivation (to decode the maestro’s message and reconnect with music) is clear and consistent, and her small experimental choices with the program fit that drive. However, she remains thinly characterized beyond “sensitive musician drawn to liminal spaces,” with little contradiction or specific, embodied emotional texture. The internal shift from restlessness to peace reads more as declared than earned through sharply dramatized struggle. The lack of visible cost or thornier impulses undercuts the depth of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motivation (to uncover the “swallowed truth”) is clear, but it mostly manifests as generalized study and reflection rather than pressured, specific choices. Her interiority is often abstract (“fault-tolerant nature,” “context-dependent construct”) instead of embodied contradiction, so we don’t feel her struggle moment to moment. The fever and its breaking promise an emotional rupture that never becomes a concrete dilemma on the page. The arc from certainty-seeking to accepting provisional truth is credible but thematically told rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    The explorer has a clear curiosity-driven motivation and a loose internal aim (“find the weight of a swallowed truth”), but they remain fairly generic and under-particularized. Emotional states are largely labeled (“excitement mixed with trepidation,” “drowsy alertness”) rather than embodied through idiosyncratic reactions. The final “clarity” arrives as declaration more than earned, conflicted choice. No real contradictory impulses or costly renunciations surface on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.5)
    The chronicle keeper’s motive (to witness without judgment) and temperament (loose grip on reality, attraction to silence) are clearly articulated but more told than dramatized. Their main choice—abandoning the quill to burrow—is thematically apt yet emotionally underdeveloped, with minimal embodied conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Interiority stays at an abstract, almost mantra-like level instead of showing specific, idiosyncratic reactions. As a result, the character reads more as a symbolic function than a fully inhabited person.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria has a clear, consistent motivation as a mellow music therapist who wants to nurture wonder, and her external actions align with that. However, she lacks real internal contradiction or struggle; there’s no moment where competing impulses pull her in different directions. Eli reads more as a symbolic child of wonder than an individuated character, with minimal interiority. The ending “satisfaction” feels earned enough but carries no visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Emilia’s motivation—to collect the stories walls have heard—is clear but largely untested, with no meaningful resistance or cost. Her interiority is summarized in generic terms (“deep-seated desire”) rather than shown through specific, contradictory impulses. There is no on-page moment where she must choose between competing values; she simply does the thing she likes doing from start to finish. The ending sense of “completion” feels declarative rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Oracle has a clear role and a few distinguishing traits (cryptic, prophetic, fortune writer), but interiority never deepens beyond generic awareness that “life is about to change.” Their choices—deciding to “orchestrate” the meeting and later returning to their writing—aren’t tested against any real opposition or internal contradiction. The stranger remains a cipher with no discernible motive, leaving the relationship empty of pressure. The final sense of change feels told rather than earned through dramatized micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.5)
    The priest’s motive (“illuminate hidden assumptions,” avert possession) is clearly stated but never deepens into conflicted interiority or embodied emotion. He never faces a real dilemma; his ritual proceeds smoothly from start to finish with no visible cost or doubt. The closing “smiled, knowing that his work was done” feels unearned because nothing on the page has threatened his success.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The writer has a clear, consistent longing to reclaim childhood-inspired creativity, but this remains generalized rather than particular to a specific, lived person. Interiority is mostly abstract (“chronologically homesick heart,” “deep longing”) and lacks concrete contradictions or sharply individuating details. Actions (unfurling the map, tracing memories, leaving) align with the stated motive but never force a hard trade-off or reveal a flaw. The final “sense of purpose” feels more asserted than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation (“to conquer the labyrinth of self” and master the tablet) is stated but not deepened into character-specific conflict or contradiction. Her “periodically eternal existence” is intriguing yet never dramatized in behavior beyond abstract mention. She meets “echoes of herself” but integrates them without struggle, so interior change feels declared rather than earned. The final empowerment reads as a generic ascension beat with minimal visible cost or nuanced psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s core motivation—escaping emotional numbness through a tactile, silent relationship with music—is clear and consistent, and the deaf music teacher detail individualizes her. However, her interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized through concrete moments of doubt, resistance, or contradictory impulses. There are almost no real micro-choices under pressure beyond a generalized decision to remain in the cavern. The ending shift to peace is believable but low-cost, with little on-page struggle earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The storm recorder has a few defined traits (meticulous, solitary, principled, curious), but her interiority is generic and largely summarized rather than embodied. Her fear of being watched never meaningfully conflicts with her drive to investigate; there’s no sustained on-page push-pull between caution and curiosity. The resolve to “uncover the truth, no matter the cost” is rhetorically big but not earned by dramatized sacrifice or visible loss. For an elite venue, the character feels more like a role in an outline than a fully inhabited mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s grief, nostalgia, and sensitivity to scent are clear and consistent, but they’re mostly told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her “transformation” from burdened to peaceful feels a bit tidy, with little sense of contradictory impulses (e.g. wanting to hold on vs. let go) playing out in scene. The backstory about her mother and perfumery adds dimension but doesn’t produce new, pressured behavior in the present moment. Overall she reads specific but emotionally smoothed, not yet at the level of lived complexity this venue would require.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet has a clear, consistent motivation (to understand the new world and the “texture of time”), but she rarely faces on-page pressure that forces revealing choices. Her emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and we don’t see contradictory impulses acting in the moment—only calm curiosity and wonder. The rope and the energy beings hint at darker stakes, yet they never push her into genuine internal conflict. The closing “understanding” feels gently asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The violinist’s desire to find “beauty in the unfinished” is clear and consistent, and her choice to play is a believable extension of that motive. However, she remains largely emblematic rather than individuated; we don’t see contradictory impulses or specific, character-particular reactions under pressure. Her emotional journey from desolation to hope feels smooth and unconflicted, which makes the final peace slightly under-earned. The elderly woman is purely facilitative and doesn’t apply meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dealer’s role and professional mindset are clear, but she never faces genuine pressure that forces revealing choices. Her motivation to craft “almost, but not quite, real” emotions is interesting yet remains largely declarative. Internal conflict is minimal; “subsuming her own emotions” is asserted, not dramatized in a moment of strain. The final sense of peace feels unearned because little has challenged her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena and Sophia are clear, kind, and coherent, but they read as types more than fully realized people, with minimal contradiction or pressure-tested emotion. Lena’s “shrewd seaside cargo broker” identity hardly affects her choices beyond a line of exposition. Motivation (to uplift silent contributors) is explicit and consistent but never really challenged, so there’s little sense of cost. The relationship forms quickly without friction, which keeps characterization from deepening.

    Kael’s desire for belonging and expression through art is clear and consistent, and the marsh-reed sculptor detail gives them some individuality. However, there is almost no dramatized contradiction or hard choice—Kael rarely faces resistance, doubt, or genuine risk on the page. Emotional states are often summarized in abstract terms (“deep longing to belong,” “luminescent ache”) instead of embodied, character-specific reactions. The final “transformation” into peace and connection feels announced more than earned through interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra has a clear, particular motivation (finding the birthplace of echoes, driven by years of study) and a defined vocation, but she faces almost no real resistance or internal contradiction once the spell begins. Her emotions are mostly told in elevated abstractions (“deep sense of connection”) rather than embodied in specific, pressured reactions. The final change—her art being “infused with the essence of the infinite”—is asserted more than earned through hard choices or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conjurer has a clear, consistent motivation (understanding “the mathematics of emotion”) and a coherent emotional palette, but she remains mostly an abstract type rather than an individuated person. Her interiority leans on labels like “ambiguous loss” without much concrete, embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The “discovery” arrives with little dramatized struggle or cost, so the internal shift feels more declared than earned. As a result, there is change on the page, but it’s muted and somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dweller has a clear, specific sensibility—gentle, meticulous, attuned to scraps and hidden spaces—but their emotional life remains mostly singular (quiet longing to be seen) with little on-page contradiction or friction. The sense-memory triggered by the tape is vivid yet doesn’t expose a deeper flaw, blind spot, or irrationality; it just reinforces wistful nostalgia. Motivation “to become visible to those who needed them” is asserted late rather than built through pressured choices. The closing endurance/renunciation (remaining hidden while wanting visibility) is conceptually strong but under-dramatized, so the cost doesn’t land fully.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia’s desire for change and fear of it are clearly articulated, but they’re mostly told in abstraction rather than shown through specific, pressured choices. Her “circuitously sincere nature” is labeled, then explained, rather than revealed via conflicted on-page behavior. The final shift—deciding to embrace metamorphosis—feels thematically apt but relatively low-cost because we haven’t seen her truly resist or fail before. Character reads coherent but not deeply particularized or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator’s motive—processing war trauma through art and seeking meaning via the brooch—is clear and consistent, but emotionally rendered in fairly generic terms. Interiority leans on summary (“I felt a sense of closure,” “I became obsessed”) more than embodied contradiction or nuanced conflict. The stranger functions more as an exposition device than a pressure-bearing character. The final shift into “closure” is told rather than earned through difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.0)
    Aria functions more as an emblematic mystic than a fully individuated person, with motivations and inner life summarized in abstract terms (“her task was not merely to foresee the future but to magnify the everyday magic”) rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Her surprise at not foreseeing the pilgrim’s arrival is promising but not followed by genuine doubt, fear, or contradiction. Emotional states are labeled rather than embodied, and her “change” is an uncomplicated expansion of power with no visible cost or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist’s core motive—to compile fragments into a healing narrative—is clear and consistent, but she remains more a function than a fully dimensional person. Her “reactively visionary” nature is asserted rather than dramatized through specific missteps or contradictions, and we rarely see embodied, conflicting impulses under pressure. The shopkeeper exists only as a brief catalyst with no real relational crucible. The closing sense of pride and accomplishment feels plausible but a bit over-neat because we never see her doubt, fail, or pay a visible emotional price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    Emilia’s goal is clear and consistent—she wants to reach the fortress of unspoken truths—but her inner life stays generic, mostly summarized with phrases like “trembling certainty” and “overwhelming urge” rather than dramatized through concrete, character-specific reactions. The “meticulous route mapper” and “analytically artistic” traits are barely enacted and never put under pressure. There is little sense of internal contradiction; she is simply drawn forward and succeeds. Her transformation at the end is asserted rather than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    Emilia’s curiosity and skeptical-but-open disposition are clear, and her goal—understanding the tile and its memories—is consistent, but she faces no meaningful resistance that forces revealing choices. Interiority is mostly abstract (“sense of purpose,” “understanding deepened”) rather than embodied or idiosyncratic. There is little genuine internal conflict; she never seems truly torn or at risk. Her change at the end (newfound appreciation, peace) is declared rather than earned through hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael has a clear baseline (bored immortal, piqued by the amulet) and a legible shift from apathy to awe, but his inner life is largely summarized in generic terms (“curiosity was piqued,” “mixture of wonder and trepidation”) rather than embodied, character-specific feeling. The duplicate Kael is an idea more than a person, so their interaction lacks friction or real psychological tension. Contradictory impulses are barely dramatized; there’s no genuine struggle about whether to risk the cursed fragment or what it might cost. The final understanding about goodbye feels more declared than earned through nuanced interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lena has a coherent inner lens (father’s teachings, attraction to the ink pot, questions about “fair trade”), but her internal conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in choice. The “honest child of a con artist” tension is gestured at but never truly pressures her into a specific, costly dilemma. Her final stance—being “ready to take a chance”—feels generically earned rather than sharply particular to her flaws or blind spots. The father reads as a lightly sketched archetype, functioning more as premise-delivery than as a fully realized pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stationer has a clear, consistent motivation (collecting “textures” and invented histories), but she lacks internal conflict or meaningful contradiction, and her emotional life remains abstract. Her actions are all of a piece—note-taking, walking, observing—with no moment where values collide or a choice carries cost. We’re told about her fascination and satisfaction rather than feeling any embodied struggle or ambivalence. The ending registers as a continuation of baseline traits, not an earned shift or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    The survivor’s core motive—to reconstruct erased histories—is clear, but remains almost entirely abstract and untested. Interiority is generalized (“a morbid fascination,” “need to understand the texture of memories”) rather than embodied or character-particular, and we never see contradictory impulses under pressure. The final “sense of clarity” is told more than felt, with no real cost or renunciation on the page. Overall, the figure functions more as an idea-carrier than as a fully realized person.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.8)
    The myth buster’s core desire (decode the universal riddle) is clear, but we get almost no real internal contradiction or struggle around it. “Gloomy cheerfulness” is named rather than dramatized in specific, conflicting impulses. Her emotions are mostly summary (“a sense of triumph washed over her”) without embodied, character-particular texture. The final “newfound understanding” feels unearned because we haven’t seen her pay any emotional or moral cost to get there.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Ava’s motives (protect the city, resist gentrification) are clear but largely told rather than dramatized, and we rarely see concrete, pressured choices. Her profession and “orderly intuitive nature” are labels more than embodied traits, and internal conflict around her “dual allegiance” is asserted without being staged in specific moments. The piece lacks contradictory impulses in scene or any visible cost she pays. As a result, she reads more as an emblematic agent of theme than as a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation (documenting the last lunar flora) is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans on generic phrasing (“poignant reminder,” “fragility of life”) rather than character-specific contradiction or complexity. Her curiosity about the sand grain is a nice touch, yet it doesn’t expose deeper flaws or competing impulses under pressure. Emotional beats (awe, melancholy, satisfaction) track logically but without surprising or idiosyncratic shading. The closing acceptance of bittersweet loss feels earned but relatively low-stakes internally.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia is clearly established as a calm, gifted, soulful artisan with a distinctive method and blindness, but we see almost no internal conflict or emotional modulation as she works. Her motivation—fix the drone—is straightforward and never meaningfully strained, so there’s little sense of risk or cost. The blindness shapes her technique but not her psychology under pressure. The final sense of satisfaction is pleasant but not deeply earned because nothing in her stance had to change.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s motive (track the singular convergence) is clear and consistent, and we get a few gestures toward contradiction (subtle confidence vs inner turmoil), but those tensions never materialize into a concrete, pressured choice. Her emotions are mostly summarized in generalized terms (“turmoil,” “fierce determination”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The “dry-witted atlas editor” promise is never really cashed out on the page; her voice and perceptions feel interchangeable with any earnest seeker. The final step onto the ice suggests resolve but not a visibly costly or morally complicated turn.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The tuner is more a ritual function than a psychologically realized person: we get labels (“infinitely patient”) and role, but almost no interiority, contradiction, or embodied emotion. Motivation is stated in abstract terms (“restore a shared balance”) rather than dramatized through pressured choices. There is effectively no internal conflict or visible cost to their stance. This keeps the figure archetypal but thin for a venue demanding rich characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to preserve the temple’s memories—is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans on generic formulations (“overwhelming sense of purpose,” “deep sense of loss”) rather than character-specific texture. We glimpse little contradiction or genuine struggle; once she commits, success feels untroubled by doubt or error. Her emotional life is largely summarized instead of embodied in concrete, idiosyncratic reactions. The result is functional but not yet vivid or singular enough for high-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    The boy’s central desire—to “thread the labyrinth with his own story”—is clear, but his interiority is more stated than dramatized, with little contradiction or specific psychology beyond inherited legacy and curiosity. Emotional texture leans on generalized awe and “sense of purpose” rather than idiosyncratic reactions to concrete stimuli. His choices are minimal (he keeps walking, he touches the lock), and no on-page cost or renunciation reconfigures him by the end. The legacy of his father is gestured to but never meaningfully pressures or complicates his present decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivations are clear—ghost bride wants to repay a multi-lifetime debt, alchemist wants “resonant awakenings”—but both are delivered as exposition rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The alchemist barely has interiority beyond “longing,” and her key act (grasping the bead) feels inevitable rather than pressured. The ghost bride’s “lovingly venomous” nature is stated, not shown in a dilemma or morally fraught act. The relationship is touching but emotionally smoothed, with little contradiction or real cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motivation—to transform ruin into reverence through weaving—is clear and consistent, but largely declared rather than dramatized through specific, pressured choices. Interiority stays abstract (“orchid solace,” “tapestry of hope”) instead of giving us contradictory impulses or embodied feeling. There’s no real moment where her resolve is tested or a meaningful option is foreclosed. The ending “change” feels like a restatement of her initial stance rather than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya’s core motivation (reconnecting with heritage, restoring lost faith) is clear and consistent, and her actions—excavating, returning to the sundial—align with that. However, she faces almost no concrete resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses in scene; her emotional life is mostly reported as steady “cautious enchantment.” Phrases like “she felt a sense of harmony growing within her” are generic and flatten specificity. The final “rebuild” within herself is asserted more than earned through dramatized, pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cipher’s core motive—to encode and send a meaningful letter—is clear but emotionally thin and almost entirely unpressured. Interiority is generalized (“felt a sense of peace,” “thrill of excitement”) rather than embodied in concrete, idiosyncratic reactions. There is little sense of contradictory impulses, doubt, or genuine cost to their choices; the recipient is abstract and never sharpens into a relationship under pressure. The ending stance (satisfaction, anticipation) largely repeats the beginning rather than reflecting a meaningful internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The embroiderer has clear motives (listening for hidden stories, preventing a coup) and a defined persona ("disguise wisdom as foolishness"), but these remain mostly told rather than dramatized. There is little embodied emotion or specific, character-particular perception beyond generic “sense of urgency.” Internal conflict is almost absent; the embroiderer never confronts a concrete trade-off or doubt on the page. The closing stance shift—from working to acting as a future guide—is conceptually present but not earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s motivation—to uncover the truth behind the unsent letters and inhabit “the moment before deciding”—is clear and consistent, and her role as conduit for unspoken regret is well-established. However, her interiority leans on summary (“thoughts were consumed…”) rather than embodied contradiction or specific blind spots under pressure. The confrontation with the manifested letter-writer is emotionally sketched but lacks granular, character-particular reactions or micro-choices. The change at the end (carrying the essence of the unsent letters) feels earned but not deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael’s role and inner state are clear, but they stay at the level of broad labels—“anxieties,” “old wounds,” “lotus-hearted ache”—rather than specific, character-particular contradictions. Her conflict-zone background barely informs any concrete choice in the scene. The turn from haunted to peaceful hinges on decrypting the cast, but this arrives as an unstruggled epiphany rather than a pressured decision with visible cost. She feels more like an archetype of wounded empathy than an individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lena’s core motivation—escaping stagnation and rediscovering joy—is clear and consistent, and we see her make a few concrete choices (exploring the orchard, taking the fragment, making and leaving the mural). However, her interiority is fairly generalized (“lost and uninspired”) rather than sharply particular, with little embodied contradiction or real struggle under pressure. The shift from wandering in the orchard to suddenly “back at her easel” is conceptually interesting but doesn’t deepen her psychological complexity. Her change at the end feels pleasant but low-cost and somewhat unearned in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lena’s core motivation (restoration mastery becoming stifling, desire to go beyond boundaries) is clear and consistent with her choice to experiment with the mirrors. However, her inner life remains relatively generalized—there’s little concrete, character-specific contradiction or cost beyond “certainty vs. curiosity,” and her emotional shifts are summarized more than dramatized. The grandmother/coin connection suggests depth but is only lightly touched rather than tested under pressure. The change at the end feels earned but emotionally low-risk and somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lyra’s motives (resisting thought-taxation via coded gardening) are clear but almost entirely told rather than dramatized, with no true on-page dilemma or contradictory impulses. Her “charming rogue scholar” aspect never meaningfully complicates or costs her anything, and we rarely feel her body or emotions under pressure. The arc is more a static portrait of competence than a character undergoing strain or change. As a result, the final endurance of her work reads conceptually earned but not emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s core drive—to transform turmoil into beauty—is clear and consistent, and the centuries-long vigil gives her a distinct psychology. However, her inner life is mostly single-note longing and purpose; there’s little real contradiction or messy ambivalence under pressure. The shift at the end toward peace and “reef-shadow joy” lands, but it feels relatively costless and untested. More embodied, conflicted reactions to the postcard or to her isolation would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caretaker has a clear, specific motive and a consistent melancholy, but she rarely faces actual pressure that would reveal contradictions or force meaningful choices. Her “labor of love” reads more as static vocation than evolving internal conflict. Moments like her glance at the cracked chime hint at richer complexity that the story never fully dramatizes. The ending reprises her stance rather than developing it.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to restore trust after a damaging misinterpretation—is clear and consistent, and the past mistake gives her a concrete emotional wound. However, most of her arc is summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told she dedicated herself and felt the weight lifting rather than seeing her face any real-time dilemma or pushback. Internal conflict (fear of renewed isolation vs. drive toward breakthrough) is present but cushioned, with little on-page cost to her choices. The final self-trust beat feels gently earned but emotionally low-stakes for a piece aiming at elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelin’s professional identity and reverent connection to the site are clear, but her internal life is largely one-note: she moves from already-committed to slightly-more-committed without a felt struggle. The supposed conflict between preservation and safety is asserted rather than dramatized in her thoughts or choices. “Her heart tremble[s]” and “resolve deepened” read as labels more than the culmination of contradictory impulses in action. The final sense of belonging feels pleasant but under-earned because no meaningful alternative stance or flaw is tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia’s role and habits are clear, and her need for secrecy versus connection gives her a credible internal tension, but it stays mostly summarized rather than dramatized. We’re told she’s meticulous, has reinvented her past, and has learned to trust again, yet we rarely see those traits tested in a concrete choice. Emotions skew toward labels and atmospherics (“bittersweet sensation,” “sense of peace”) more than embodied, idiosyncratic reactions. The ending “change” (peace, balance) feels gentle and plausible but not strongly earned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrator has a clear through-line—curiosity and a desire to understand “necessary distances” and sacred thresholds—but emotional texture remains generic (“I felt a surge of determination… a sense of peace”) and mostly uncontradicted. The child/adult voice mismatch (sophisticated diction for a supposedly lost child) weakens character-particular interiority. The father is more symbol than person, appearing as a benign, unpressured reward at the end. The final “change” (no longer lost, having found father and path) is asserted rather than earned through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.0)
    The astrologer’s motivation (“to learn the rhythm of belonging”) is clear but almost entirely told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses or concrete choices. We never see them hesitate, doubt, or misread the place; interiority is abstract and interchangeable with many lyric protagonists. The supposed change at the end (having “uncovered the hidden rhythms”) arrives without visible cost or struggle. As a result, the character feels more like a functionary of theme than a fully realized person.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    The recollectionist has clear motive and a consistent emotional throughline, but she remains more archetype than individuated person. Her “cheerful gloom” is stated rather than dramatized via contradictory impulses in tense moments. The key realization at the symbols reads as a smooth, unconflicted epiphany without visible internal cost. Most feelings are summarized abstractly rather than embodied in distinctive, character-specific perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elian has a clear vocation and aesthetic philosophy, but he never encounters meaningful resistance or internal contradiction; his “analytical” nature doesn’t clash with his attraction to serendipity in any dramatized way. Emotions are mostly labeled (“felt a sense of harmony,” “deep connection”) rather than embodied. Micro-choices (using the bishop, planning the act) don’t reveal competing values under pressure. The closing “hint of mischief” and weight of the bishop suggest potential depth, but the story doesn’t force a change or costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation (to create the “cosmic verse”) is clear and consistent, and her choice to dance functions as a concrete response to that drive. However, she experiences almost no contradictory impulses or real resistance; she moves from contemplation to fulfillment with little struggle or ambiguity. Emotional embodiment tends toward generalized serenity and awe rather than character-specific texture. The final sense of purpose feels lightly earned because we haven’t seen her genuinely risk failure or confront a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The glazier’s vocation and worldview are clearly sketched, and her drive “to illuminate value in the mundane” is consistent. However, she encounters almost no real pressure, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or hard choices that would deepen her. Emotions are mostly summarized (“a sense of peace,” “a sense of wonder”) rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The ending’s self-definition (“she knew that she was not just a glazier, but a seeker of meaning”) feels more told than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s basic profile (scarred wildfire fighter, burdened by experience, unexpectedly gentle) is clear and coherent, but his motivations stay generalized (“make a difference,” “enlighten others”) rather than dramatized through specific contradictory impulses in the moment. His emotional life is told in broad terms (“world of pain,” “fractured soul”) without much idiosyncratic embodiment. The shift from skeptic to “messenger” is stated rather than earned via a concrete choice that costs him something on the page. Overall he reads more like an emblematic figure than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motive—“to puzzle out new equations for hope”—is clear and consistent, and her actions (sitting, arranging, envisioning) align with it. However, her interiority stays generalized and largely unconflicted; we are told she is a “logical dreamer” but rarely see contradictory impulses or a concrete flaw under pressure. The brief overwhelm in the vision (“exhilarating and terrifying”) never forces a difficult trade-off or visible cost. The closing serenity feels pleasant but not deeply earned by dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.5)
    The cartographer has a clear, consistent motivation (curiosity, desire to understand the estate and its “dreams”), but interiority is almost entirely summarized and unpressured. We’re told they are “sensitively perceptive” and deeply affected by the diaries, yet we rarely see conflicting impulses or concrete, embodied emotional responses under strain. The final sense of peace and purpose is plausible but feels lightly earned because no real dilemma or cost is dramatized. Overall they read as a thin vessel for theme rather than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The painter’s goal—to coax the mirrors into revealing possibilities—is clear and consistent, but she remains more an archetypal “mystic artist” than an individuated person. Interiority is almost entirely summary (“perceptively calm,” “sense of wonder”) rather than particular, embodied contradiction under pressure. Her emotional trajectory is essentially flat: serene, then serenely satisfied, without a felt internal conflict or cost. The closing “content to be a part of it” reads as unearned serenity rather than the endpoint of a dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian’s motivation (end a “forever war” at great personal cost) is clear but rendered mostly in abstract summary, with very few concrete micro-choices under pressure. His “flawed beauty” and exhaustion are asserted rather than dramatized in specific behaviors or contradictions. No other characters appear on the page in a way that pressures him directly, so relational dynamics and real-time struggle are absent. The closing sense of personal peace is conceptually earned, but the emotional cost is thinly embodied (mostly sleeplessness and generic burden).

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The interiority is clear—her hidden sentimentality versus the “amoral philanthropist” label—but this contradiction never truly bites or forces a difficult trade-off. Her plan is fully formed before the scene starts, so we don’t watch motivation intensify under pressure. Emotion is often told in abstract (“pang of sentimentality”) rather than embodied in idiosyncratic ways. The ending shows satisfaction but not a meaningful cost or altered self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courtesan’s motivation—to escape “the lullaby of conformity”—is clear but largely abstract, with little in the way of concrete, character-specific history or contradiction. Her interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“weight of expectation,” “new sense of purpose”) rather than idiosyncratic thought or embodied emotion. The transformation feels more declared than struggled for; we don’t see her genuinely torn between staying bound and breaking away. As a result, the closing change reads more like a symbolic pivot than a fully earned, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Amaranth has a clear, consistent motivation (“on a mission to explore the ethics of storytelling”), but she rarely faces on-page pressure that forces revealing choices or contradictions. Her emotional state is mostly summarized (soothed, satisfied, grateful) rather than embodied in concrete, character-specific reactions. The earlier “heated argument” is off-stage and never complicates her present behavior. By the end she’s essentially the same person with a slightly re-affirmed sense of purpose, so change and cost feel minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s core motive—to honor overlooked histories through ritual craft—is clear and consistent, and her actions (knotting thread, building structures, leaving with resolve) align with it. However, she experiences almost no internal contradiction or real pressure; there’s no competing desire that complicates her reverence. Emotion is largely summarized (“felt a sense of peace,” “deep sense of reverence”) rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic sensations or irrational impulses. The final “resolve” reads more like a gentle continuation than a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    Akira’s core motivation—preserving forgotten names after self-forgiveness—is clear and consistent, and her craft focus gives her some specificity. However, almost all of this is told rather than dramatized, and there is little sense of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her gentleness and technical skill are asserted but not really tested. The closing sense of peace feels somewhat unearned because we never see her seriously doubt or risk failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Hindsight’s core motivation (understanding “why some paths choose their walkers”) is clear and consistent, but largely told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Emotional texture is abstract—there’s almost no embodied reaction to the “decaying directive” or the dream revelations. Internal contradiction or genuine struggle with limitations (e.g., only retrospective sight) is asserted but not enacted. The final acceptance that the path has chosen them reads more like a calm restatement than a hard-earned, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The astronomer’s core motive—to decode the tile and seal a covenant—is clear but largely asserted rather than dramatized through specific, pressured choices. We rarely see contradictory impulses in motion; skepticism versus wonder is named (“empirically ironic”) but not embodied in concrete reactions or missteps. Emotional life is abstract (“sense of unity,” “deep and abiding sense of wonder”) rather than grounded in sensory, character-particular experience. The closing transformation into a being of “profound purpose” feels unearned because little resistance or cost has been shown on the way there.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—guiding resentful people toward release—is clear and consistent, and her pacifism plus “scheming” angle is at least conceptually interesting. However, she remains largely idealized and unconflicted; there’s no real evidence of contradictory impulses or visible cost as she acts. Her emotional life is described in abstract, generalized language (“she pondered the concept of shifting grace”) rather than embodied, character-specific perception. The change she effects in others is big, but her own inner state barely shifts, which flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.5)
    The mirror maker has a clear want (to capture a runaway dream) but little textured interiority or contradiction; her emotions are mostly told rather than embodied. Her choices (claiming the sextant, making the mirror, entering it) align with this motive but are never meaningfully tested or conflicted. The shift from “firmly grounded” to dissolving into the dream-world registers conceptually but without much felt cost or psychological nuance. She reads more as a function of theme than as a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara has a clear profile (devoted healer, estranged mother) and consistent motive, but she rarely faces on-page pressure that forces contradictory impulses to collide. Most emotional material is summarized rather than dramatized, so we’re told about her vows and longing for Aria more than we feel them in embodied micro-choices. Aria herself functions almost entirely as an idea until the very end, giving their reunion limited psychological texture. The final change—mother and daughter tending together—feels gentle and plausible but not deeply earned through prior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    The curator has a clear throughline of curiosity and unease, but they remain generic, with little individuating detail beyond their role and “disquiet.” Their key choice—to follow the robed figure and accept the book—fits their stated curiosity yet lacks on-page resistance or visible cost. Emotional states are mostly labeled (“disquiet,” “brightened disquiet”) rather than embodied. The internal shift to “sense of purpose” is asserted more than earned through dramatized conflict.

    Elara’s motives (knowledge + prestige) are clear and consistent, and her “carefully resourceful” nature produces some credible tactics, but her interior life is mostly summarized rather than embodied. There’s almost no real internal conflict; she never has to choose between competing values in a costly way. The late “new sense of purpose” reads as declared rather than fully earned by specific, dramatized dilemmas. The time traveler is a functional foil with minimal depth, and the relationship never becomes a genuine crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s desire (to find the Garden) is clear and consistent, and her pattern-seeing ability loosely informs her actions, but she remains largely untested and unconflicted. Emotional states are labeled more than embodied, and her final “shift” into peace feels more assumed than earned by struggle. Traits like “chimera twin discoverer” and “blissfully aberrant” don’t manifest in concrete, pressured choices. The arc from curiosity to serenity lacks a visible cost or a decisive internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia and the professor have clear roles and consistent traits (adaptable archivist; warmly methodical elder), but their interiority remains thin and largely untroubled. Emilia’s “surge of understanding” and lasting change are asserted rather than earned through visible struggle or contradiction. There’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk that would deepen her motivation beyond curiosity and professional duty.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mapkeeper has a clear, consistent motivation and role, and her craft (reading crack patterns) individualizes her somewhat. However, her emotions and inner life are mostly summarized rather than embodied, with little contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. She rarely faces a difficult choice; success comes smoothly once she begins her process. This flattens her arc and undercuts a sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The custodian’s core motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning and rekindle lost knowledge—is clearly stated but rarely dramatized through conflicted choices. Emotional life is mostly summarized (determination, awe, hope) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. There’s little sense of internal contradiction or cost; they move steadily from curiosity to triumph. The final sense of “deep and abiding sense of purpose” feels earned enough but also generic.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.0)
    The archivist’s desire to understand and define herself via collective memory is clear and consistent, and her interior lens on the world feels specific. However, she faces almost no real resistance or contradictory impulse; the “weight of her task” never forces a difficult trade-off or visibly costs her anything. Her final acceptance of being a guardian feels more like a graceful restatement of what she already was than a pressured, earned shift. This limits the depth of characterization under a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s basic motivation (recovering inspiration, “defy the gravity of hopelessness”) is clear and consistent, and her occupation gives her a specific perceptual filter. However, she faces almost no genuine on-page pressure, makes no difficult choice, and shows little internal contradiction—her mood simply lightens as inputs arrive. The emotional shift from hopelessness to renewed purpose is told rather than deeply dramatized in embodied, idiosyncratic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.5)
    The chronicler’s core motivation (to understand the “texture of time”) is clearly stated, but rarely tested; she remains serenely contemplative throughout, with no real contradictory impulse or cost. Her interiority is mostly abstracted thought rather than character-specific conflict, and the two frozen figures never become true relational pressure. The ending offers a modest deepening of her calm stance rather than an earned shift. This is competent but emotionally safe characterization for a venue aiming at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eli’s motivation (collecting silences to ease claustrophobia) is clear and consistent, and the father’s plan provides a legible frame, but emotional life is mostly summarized rather than embodied. We’re told they feel excitement, dread, and later peace, yet we rarely see concrete, character-specific reactions to space or confinement. The internal contradiction between fear of enclosure and attraction to the trellis is stated rather than dramatized in scene. The change at the end (claustrophobia “no longer the dominant force”) is plausible but reads as gently asserted rather than wrestled for.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    The gondola operator has a clear, consistent motivation (to “teach silence how to comfort”), but she reads more as an embodiment of an idea than as a fully individuated person. Interiority is abstract and placid, with almost no contradictory impulses or real friction under pressure. Her actions (gliding, monitoring, contemplating) pose no emotional cost or dilemma. The result is coherent but emotionally thin characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation (claim the throne, restore Xylophia-IV) is clear and consistent, but she rarely feels under genuine pressure, and her emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied. The “wisely adventurous” label never really manifests as a live internal contradiction or difficult tradeoff. Her final assumption of the throne feels more like the fulfillment of a foretold role than a costly, character-specific decision. As a result, she reads more as an archetype than an individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper’s motivation (preserve, then revive the sanctuary; “teach suffocating to breathe”) is clear but largely told rather than dramatized in specific, embodied choices. Interiority leans on general melancholy and longing without sharp, character-particular contradictions. The decisive change—choosing no longer to remain isolated—lands, but its cost feels lightly sketched and emotionally under-tested. Overall, the character is coherent but not yet deep or singular enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lyra has a clear backstory (pyramid scheme survivor) and concrete curiosity driving her choices, but her interiority remains generalized and conflict-free. She moves from problem to solution without real doubt, contradiction, or moral tension. The “virtuously mischievous” label is repeated but not deeply dramatized in action. Her change at the end (finding her place in the world) feels asserted more than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dynasty ender’s motivation (to uncover a hidden truth) is clear but extremely one-note and faces no meaningful internal resistance. We never learn anything concrete or idiosyncratic about who they are beyond their role and reverence for knowledge. Emotion is narrated in abstractions (“maelstrom of images and emotions”) rather than embodied contradiction or specific feeling. The final shift into “their dynasty would be the last” is asserted without being meaningfully earned through prior, character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.5)
    The knight’s basic motive—responding to an uncanny pull and wanting to “capture the shape of possibility”—is clear, but their interior life is thin and largely summarized. “Withdrawn” versus newly purposeful is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or specific habits. No real contradictory impulses appear; once the name Lysander appears, the knight cooperates with the experience without hesitation or cost. The closing change of nature (withdrawn → purposeful conduit) is legible but emotionally under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s basic motivation—to find and honor forgotten stories—is clear, but it’s almost entirely told to us rather than dramatized through conflicted choices under pressure. Her “broken-hearted” state remains abstract; we never see a specific wound or contradiction that complicates her new purpose. The internal shift from despair to purposeful guardianship feels unopposed and therefore a bit frictionless. This limits the sense of cost or depth to her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motivation (resisting erasure and indifference) is clear and consistent, but it’s almost entirely told rather than dramatized through pressured choices. We rarely see contradictory impulses—she never seriously hesitates about leaving hiding or speaking at the gathering. Her resourcefulness is asserted but not meaningfully tested on the page. The final endurance (“she had held the line, for now”) lands, but without a concrete felt cost to deepen her as an individual.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent—she wants to hush the prophecy—but we never feel an internal struggle or layered emotional life behind that aim. Interiority is almost entirely implied through the music, with very little embodied or idiosyncratic reaction. She reads more as a symbolic function than a person, which blunts the impact of her “victory.” The ending offers no visible cost or contradiction in her stance, only serene fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    The seed sorter has a clear throughline of curiosity and reverence for the arbor, and her actions (prodding the speck, building monuments, decoding the leaves) are consistent with those traits. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; emotions tend toward flat “wonder” rather than layered, embodied feeling. The transformation at the end is asserted more than earned through conflicted choices, with little visible cost. As a result, she reads as a functional vessel for atmosphere rather than a fully individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian has a coherent throughline—broken tinkerer seeking direction—but his inner life stays abstract, with emotions often summarized (“felt a sense of calm,” “sense of clarity”) rather than made particular. His shift from trying to “impose order” to “befriending uncertainty” is stated more than dramatized, so the cost of that change never fully lands. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses in the moment of building or choosing to step into the unknown. As a result, he feels more like an emblematic figure than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to redeem herself and reconcile material and mystical realms—is clear but largely told rather than dramatized through concrete choices. Her emotions are abstract (“luminous regret,” “insatiable desire”) with little embodied texture or contradictory impulse on the page. The shift from disillusionment to renewed purpose is asserted via summary (“as the weeks turned into months…”) instead of being earned through specific moments of struggle. As a result, the final peace feels conceptually plausible but not fully felt.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The collector is clear in role and temperament, but her interiority stays generalized (“sense of satisfaction,” “sense of purpose”) and largely unconflicted. Her choices—to approach, listen, comfort—align with her stated motivation yet never strain her or expose genuine flaw. The young woman’s character is mostly a vessel for a summarized backstory, not a live presence exerting pressure. The ending offers endurance rather than change, but without a sharply felt cost that would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s basic drive (to confront her trauma and “understand the mathematics of mercy”) is clear and consistent, and her decision to leave the clinic gives her real agency. However, her interiority often leans on generalized trauma language (“trauma responses,” “taste of fear and adrenaline”) rather than character-specific perception. The shift from shattered post-interrogation state to serene understanding in the clearing happens abruptly, so the final change feels under-earned emotionally. Arin functions more as a gentle plot enabler than a crucible that complicates her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lena has a clear role and impulse—drawn to liminal spaces, compelled by hidden stories—but her interiority stays generalized and rarely embodied. The key shift (“motivation, long buried, began to resurface”) is told in abstract terms rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or costly choices. Her profession as a “between-worlds translator” is thematically apt but not enacted in specific behaviors. The emotional arc is coherent but too smooth and unchallenged for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ezra’s core traits—ghost-seer, elevator tech, compulsive observer—are clear, but she rarely feels under genuine pressure, so we don’t see those traits tested. Her motivation to uncover secrets is consistent yet unconflicted; there’s no real clash between desire, fear, and cost. The discovery of the logbook affects her mood rather than forcing a difficult choice. As a result, she reads more as a static sensibility than a fully dramatized, changing character.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    The operator remains more emissary of an idea than a person; we get no concrete contradictions, fears, or costs beyond a generalized sense of reverence and purpose. Motivation (“compressing eternity into a moment”) is declared and consistent but never pressured or complicated. Interior experience is mostly paraphrased (“knew that this was the key”) rather than dramatized in embodied, character-particular ways. The legacy/endpoint is therefore conceptually legible but not emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist has a clear history and present motive (from revolutionary to archaeologist-poet) and a legible internal stance, but we rarely see concrete contradictory impulses in scene—most of her conflict is summarized longing. Her emotional life is largely abstract (“burnished sorrow,” “solace”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or fraught micro-choices. The final “reborn” self-understanding feels somewhat declared rather than earned via visible pressure. Still, she reads as an individual with a coherent worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Erebus has a clear role and stated motivation, but he remains largely an archetypal “reverent craftsman” with minimal concrete interiority or contradiction under pressure. His desire “to reclaim the light stolen by midnight” is told rather than dramatized and never forces a difficult choice. The lack of on-page relational or situational friction keeps him from feeling fully human. His final satisfaction is believable but comes cheaply because nothing substantial challenged him en route.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist’s desire to uncover the lagoon’s and compass’s secrets is clear, and her interior focus is consistent, but her psychology remains generalized and largely untextured beyond “questing awe.” There’s little embodied contradiction or real cost—no moment where she genuinely hesitates or pays a price—so the final unity reads more like a stated outcome than the culmination of dramatized struggle. “Sensibly eccentric” never materializes as a behavioral pattern. Overall she functions as a vessel for mood rather than a fully individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s creative drive and curiosity are clear, but they’re mostly asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted, high-pressure choices. Her emotional life is relatively one-note—awed, inspired, thoughtful—with little internal contradiction or cost. The GPS failure, the storm, and the slide never force her into a genuine dilemma; they simply enable reflection. The closing satisfaction feels pleasant but low-stakes, so her “change” reads more like a gentle reaffirmation than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    Luna’s core motivation—understanding night-blooming flowers and the natural world—is clear and consistent, but she rarely faces concrete choices or trade-offs that would deepen her as a character. Her interiority leans on abstractions (“understanding,” “mysteries,” “umbral tenderness”) rather than specific, idiosyncratic thought. The shift in her art from vibrant to contemplative is stated more than dramatized, so the arc feels smooth rather than earned under pressure. Emotional contradiction (awe vs. doubt, wonder vs. fear) is largely absent, keeping her from feeling fully human.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Naomi has a clear professional identity and motivation (civil-rights archivist drawn by an encrypted diary), but her interiority stays generalized—she “feels connected” without complex, contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her one meaningful choice is to “reach out to Ada,” yet we don’t see the content of that parley or how it costs her or alters her stance in concrete terms. Ada is intriguing (retrocognitive, arranging debris) but mostly a function, not a pressured personality. By the end Naomi’s resolve is restated rather than sharpened by a visible internal conflict or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to revive and fundamentally reimagine the town—is clear and consistent, and the rejection of nostalgia gives them a distinct stance. However, their inner life remains schematic: we’re told of “fierce determination” and reverence, but almost no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The character feels more like an allegorical figure than a fully individuated person. The shift from contemplation to action at dawn is motivated but low-cost and emotionally underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.8)
    The scribe’s role and surface motivation (“to archive emotional patterns”) are clear, but interiority remains generalized and static throughout. We never see a concrete contradiction or specific personal stake beyond abstract wonder/trepidation. The third-grade memory hints at depth but isn’t tied to any difficult choice or revealed flaw. As a result, the scribe feels more like a functionary embodiment of mood than a fully realized character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The seed saver has a clear role, vocation, and sense of duty, but her inner life remains largely abstract, expressed in generalized purpose rather than concrete, individuating detail. “Furiously tranquil” is evocative but never quite dramatized as conflicting impulses on the page. Her major “choice” is essentially to accept a destiny already framed as inevitable, so the arc feels more affirmed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    Ember has a clear, consistent motivation—to favor listening over noise—and the curiosity trait is coherently dramatized in her work with sensors and the bell. However, she rarely experiences genuine internal conflict; her evolution from tester to “guardian of the wind” is smooth, with little resistance or cost. Emotional states tend to be summarized rather than embodied, and moments that could be crucibles (e.g., the hesitation at the bell rope) don’t deepen into a true values clash. The resulting arc feels pleasant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The janitor has a clear sensibility (spiritually curious, soothed by stillness) but almost no embodied internal conflict or difficult choice on the page. Motivation “to find strength in vulnerability” is told rather than dramatized, and there’s no real resistance to that desire. Interiority leans on abstractions (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance”) rather than character-particular thought. The end’s “renewed sense of purpose” feels unearned because we’ve never seen a contrary impulse or real risk.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The recluse’s core motive—to preserve the “unspoken words” in the box—is clear and consistent, and their small sequence of choices (approach, open, read, close, keep watch) tracks with that. However, their interiority leans on generalized sorrow and summary (“thoughts were a jumble of conflicting emotions”) rather than specific, character-particular contradiction under pressure. The claimed astonishment at the world’s unraveling is told, not really dramatized in present action. The final endurance/acceptance beat is credible but emotionally underpowered for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    The timekeeper has a clear role and goal, but they remain an abstract functionary rather than a textured person. Motivation (“understanding the texture of time passing”) is repeated rather than deepened or put under pressure. There is almost no contradictory impulse or real emotional cost on the page, so their final “newfound understanding” feels unearned. The lack of embodied feelings or specific personal stakes limits character resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet’s sensibility is consistent—she’s contemplative, receptive, and oriented toward beauty—but she remains largely archetypal. Motivation is told rather than dramatized (“Her motivation was not to create something perfect…”), and there’s almost no internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her final “deep understanding” feels like an extension of a pre-existing stance rather than an earned, pressured shift.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    The caretaker has a clear throughline—a calm, methodical botanist facing terminal illness—but remains largely schematic, with interiority summarized rather than embodied. Motivation (legacy, interspecies respect) is repeated instead of deepened via specific, pressured micro-choices. We never see genuine contradiction (fear vs. serenity, attachment vs. letting go) dramatized in the moment. The final endurance in the face of death reads conceptually earned but emotionally underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The skeptic has a clear curiosity/doubt mix and a conceptual motive (“chemistry of homecoming”), but we rarely see concrete, pressured choices that reveal contradiction or cost. Emotions are largely summarized (anticipation, serenity) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final “realization” that the pilgrimage is self-discovery is not strongly earned by prior micro-choices. The entity’s interiority and relational dynamics with the skeptic remain almost entirely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.8)
    The coachman has a clear, gentle motivation to heal the land, but we get almost no textured interiority beyond serene dedication. There is no visible internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he never doubts, resents, fears, or wavers. His emotional state is described in broad terms (“sense of peace”) rather than embodied specifics. The ending “change” is simply his satisfaction at completing a task, which feels small and uncostly.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra and Kael have clear, consistent motives (scavenging, seeking the spring, escaping a death-haunted past), but they remain relatively surface-level and free of real contradiction or internal conflict. Kael’s history as a body-finder doesn’t pressure his current choices in any specific way beyond a faint tonal sadness. The bond between Lyra and Kael is warm but under-tested; they never have to choose against comfort or safety for each other. The final sense of “purpose” feels earned in outline but not deeply dramatized through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria has a clear surface motivation (transforming confusion into exploration) and some history via the family sky-sketching custom, but her interiority remains generalized and low-friction. The “blessed pariah” label and “temporally stretched existence” hint at complexity that never meaningfully constrains or complicates her choices. Emotional beats skew toward summary (“overwhelming sense of disconnection,” “sense of wonder”) rather than embodied, character-specific contradiction. Her final step into the unknown is gently earned but largely costless.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Moonwhisper’s goal and basic traits are clear, but they remain almost entirely virtuous, with no real contradiction, blind spot, or pressure-exposed flaw. Interiority is shallowly idealized—“chivalrous nature demanded that they press on” is emblematic—and we never see stress degrade their thinking or force a messy choice. The mission succeeds without genuine struggle, so their self-concept as an “apprentice of wonder” is affirmed rather than tested. The final sense of change (“they had truly become an apprentice of wonder”) feels more declared than earned by hard decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characters are sketched through roles and labels (crisis actor, survivor, historian) more than through embodied, conflicted behavior. The crisis actor’s “benevolently ruthless” nature never manifests in a pressured choice, and the survivor’s shift at the end feels told rather than earned through struggle. Interiority is thin and largely abstract. Relationships never really become crucibles; everyone aligns too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    The seer has a clear through-line—she’s motivated to find the stone, unlock buried talents, and “understand the shape of home”—but her inner life remains largely told rather than dramatized. Her big choice (to seed a new reality) arrives with almost no hesitation, doubt, or conflicting impulse, so the moment feels less earned than declared. Emotional embodiment skews to external atmosphere rather than specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The result is coherent but not yet deep or sharply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tutor’s guilt and need for redemption are clear and consistent, and his occupation as a chess tutor gives his failure a specific, plausible shape. However, his emotional journey is largely summarized rather than dramatized in concrete moments of doubt or resistance. The labyrinth sequence offers little real contest between contradictory impulses; once he decides to go, everything flows smoothly toward forgiveness. As a result, the final peace feels somewhat under-earned despite being coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    The artist’s central drive (to uncover a truth and wrestle with forgiveness) is clear, but her interiority stays generalized and abstract rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. We’re told she is “defiant” and haunted by the price of forgiveness, yet we rarely see concrete conflicting impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The shift from defiance to “deeper understanding” at the end reads more as authorial declaration than as a hard-won, dramatized change with visible cost. As a result, she feels more like a symbolic figure than a fully lived person.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaelin’s motivation—to decode the statue and honor her mentor’s kintsugi philosophy—is clear and consistent, and her bodily strain (blurring vision, stale air) grounds her determination. However, her “uncertain alchemist” status never meaningfully complicates her choices; she doesn’t doubt herself in ways that alter tactics or create genuine internal conflict. The emotional palette leans on repeated abstractions (“weight of her task,” “edge of oblivion”) rather than sharply individuating traits. The final sense of peace reads earned enough, but at a relatively generic level rather than as a deeply character-specific shift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter’s core desire—to capture fleeting beauty and honor a private promise—is clear and consistent, and her profession provides a coherent frame. However, interiority is mostly summarized in abstract terms (“sense of freedom,” “intimately aloof nature”) rather than dramatized in concrete, pressured moments. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. freedom, exposure vs. secrecy) are implied but never truly clash on the page. The final “change” is more an affirmed self-concept than an earned, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s fascination with the vial cork and belief in “vibrations of intent” gives him a clear, particular interiority, and his ritual in the garden grows logically from that. However, his emotional life is almost entirely harmonious with the thesis; there is little contradiction, doubt, or friction under pressure. The final “change” is largely declared (“he knew that he had been changed”) rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with cost. As a result, he feels credible but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The navigator’s grief and desire to “navigate the geography of loss” are clear and consistent, but they’re delivered mostly in summary rather than through concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her patchwork body and moon-linked abilities are evocative traits that never really complicate her decisions or produce visible mistakes. Emotional states are labeled (“sense of peace,” “raw solace,” “acceptance”) more than embodied, which flattens her interiority. The final acceptance feels plausible but somewhat declarative, not deeply earned moment by moment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    The forager’s motives (outcast due to involuntary honesty, seeking cures to soften that) are clear, but they’re mostly conveyed in abstract summary rather than embodied scenes. Emotional states are labeled (“psychological safety,” “trauma”) instead of dramatized through concrete reactions or contradictory impulses in action. The final “resolve” feels more stated than earned because we never see their honesty actually cost them something in scene. As a result, the arc reads thoughtful but thin for elite-level literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael and the stranger are legible but thinly drawn; Kael’s “eccentricity” never concretely manifests in action, and the stranger’s interiority remains mostly guessed at. Motivation (“to decode the stranger’s final gesture”) is clear but mostly told rather than pressured into difficult choices. The final moment—Kael choosing to pick up the boutonnière and feel the “weight of the memories”—is a modest shift but not deeply earned through layered internal conflict. Emotional texture is often summarized (“a mixture of sadness and resolve”) instead of embodied in specific, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s basic motivation (fulfilling her father’s promise) is clear and consistent, and her curiosity about the chip leads logically to action. However, her interior life is mostly summarized rather than embodied, with very little contradiction or specific emotional texture beyond “sense of wonder” and fulfillment. The “series of trials” and growing confidence are declared, not dramatized, which flattens potential conflict in her characterization. The final realization about her father’s legacy feels emotionally intended but not fully earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.0)
    The queen’s desire to understand her dreams is clear, but her personality never develops beyond “disenchanted ruler drawn by ominous visions.” Interiority leans on generic phrases (“sense of purpose,” “sense of trepidation”) rather than concrete, character-specific thought. The companion barely registers as a person and exerts no pressure on the queen’s choices. The climactic “truth that would change her forever” is told, not dramatized, so the transformation reads unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist’s curiosity and “scientifically romantic” worldview are clear and consistent, and her motivation to understand the shell gives the piece a coherent through-line. However, she faces almost no resistance, internal or external, so we learn very little about her limits, blind spots, or capacity for difficult choice. The emotional palette stays in a narrow band of wonder and quiet satisfaction. As a result, her final “change” feels more like a gentle clarification than a costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrator has a clear desire (to record and make sense of their dreams) and a legible arc from confusion to a kind of creative peace, but the interiority is abstract and generalized rather than embodied or idiosyncratic. Phrases like “feral nostalgia” and “jaded wonder” label complex states instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. The jealousy of past selves is an interesting flaw but appears briefly and never forces a difficult choice. The final sense of change feels somewhat unearned because the struggle on the page is too smooth and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara has a clear central wound (loss of smell) and vocation, but her interiority leans heavily on abstracted language (“map emotional terrain,” “humanize the mundane”) rather than concrete, character-specific feelings or contradictions. Her only real on-page choices are to sit, handle the screw, and resolve to continue her work, which feels more declared than earned. There’s little sense of internal conflict between grief, anger, and purpose; she moves smoothly to insight. The result is a coherent but somewhat generic interior life lacking textured, pressured moments.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaito’s motivation (to transform his scars into stories and unlock the runes) is clear and consistent, and his choice to write through the mystical prompting tracks. However, his “scars” remain abstract, so the emotional stakes feel generalized rather than embodied in specific memories or contradictions. Internal conflict is mild—there’s little simultaneous pull between opposing impulses. The resulting change at the end feels gentle and somewhat under-costed for the language of transformation being used.

    Lyra’s motivation—to deliver an overdue apology to Astra—is clear and consistent, and her belief in “imperfect miracles” gives her some specificity. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped; we’re told she wronged Astra but never see a concrete memory or a sharp, contradictory impulse on the page. The magic works without cost or serious hesitation, so we don’t see her pushed into difficult micro-choices. Astra as a relationship crucible is entirely off-page, which blunts the emotional stakes of Lyra’s change.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aria’s motivation (“to unify the fragmented truths…”) is clearly stated, but her emotional life remains abstract and largely unembodied. We’re told she gains clarity and understanding, yet we never see a concrete struggle, doubt, or contradictory impulse on the page. Her internal journey feels declared rather than dramatized, with no meaningful cost to the change. As a result, she reads more as a symbolic function than a fully realized person.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.8)
    The shepherd has a clear, consistent motivation and a mild interior life, but almost no contradictory impulses or pressured choices. Emotions are largely summarized (“deep sense of satisfaction,” “peculiar sense of belonging”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final “renewed intensity” and vigilance feel like a restatement of the opening stance more than an altered one, so change costs are weak. Overall, the figure is more a contemplative function than a fully realized person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena has a clear intellectual motive and some sensory relationship to the farm, but her interiority leans on abstractions (“physics of letting go,” “new paradigm”) rather than character-specific contradictions. We’re told she’s an intrusion detection specialist and spatially gifted, yet these traits never meaningfully complicate or deepen her emotional responses. Her “breakthrough” at the end feels more declared than earned, with little on-page struggle or trade-off. The lack of visible internal conflict undercuts the weight of her final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (helping her compulsive-gambler father after his heart attack) is clear and consistent, but her interiority stays abstract and largely unembodied (“clover melancholy,” “widen perspectives responsibly”) rather than dramatized in specific, pressured moments. Her supposed rebelliousness and attraction to paradox are told more than shown; we don’t see her make a hard or self-costly choice. The emotional progression from concern to resolve is plausible but smoothed over as a tidy realization rather than a struggle. The father remains entirely off-page, so the central relationship never becomes a crucible that actively complicates her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.9)
    The operator’s core desire for connection-through-estrangement is clear, but almost everything is summarized rather than dramatized in specific scenes or choices. We never see a single concrete interaction with a caller, so emotions and motives stay abstract and generalized. There’s no meaningful internal contradiction or pressured decision that reveals deeper layers. The closing “peace” feels more asserted than earned because we’ve never watched them genuinely risk or lose anything.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist’s core motive—to preserve “the weight of small moments” and to understand the couple’s fate—is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains generalized and low-friction. She rarely faces a concrete dilemma or reveals contradictory impulses; nearly every action is an unpressured extension of her established traits. Emotional states are labeled (“pang of melancholy,” “haunted euphoria”) more than embodied through specific, character-particular perception. The ending offers endurance rather than change, but without a strongly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.0)
    Raven’s core motivation (curing loneliness) is clear and consistent, and their emotional state does shift by the end, which gives the arc some integrity. However, almost all of this is told in abstract terms rather than embodied in specific sensations, thoughts, or contradictory impulses in the moment. The “desperately jocular” façade never really clashes with their interiority on the page; we’re merely informed it falters. The final peace feels more asserted than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The mapmaker’s goal and backstory are clear, but interiority leans on summary (“labyrinth of sorrow and loss”) rather than dramatized contradiction or specific memories. Motivation to find the stillpoint is stated more than tested, so we rarely see competing impulses in action. The closing “newfound understanding” feels a bit pre-packaged because we haven’t witnessed real internal struggle. Still, there is a coherent sense of character through their sensory focus and reverence for the forest.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation—to “thresh meaning from experience” and unlock the pen’s potential—is clear and consistent, but remains largely abstract and unembodied. We get little in the way of concrete, character-specific emotion or contradiction under pressure; the weeds are regretted, then smoothly reinterpreted. Her final shift (seeing the weeds as necessary and embracing the pen) feels conceptually earned but emotionally underdeveloped. The piece reads more as an idea about a person than as a fully inhabited person on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.7)
    The advisor and the old man are sketched as archetypes rather than individuals, with motives told in abstract terms (“to translate silence into music”) rather than grounded in specific, idiosyncratic history or contradiction. Emotional states are labeled more than embodied, and there’s little sense of internal conflict or competing impulses. The relationship between them is touching but frictionless, so their bond never quite becomes a crucible that forces a costly choice. The closing understanding feels gentle but not particularly earned by micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s core motive (honoring a promise to a lost friend) is clear and consistent, but their inner life is rendered mostly in abstract labels rather than concrete, character-specific thought. The striking label “lending library arsonist” never meaningfully constrains or complicates choices on the page. There’s little genuine internal contradiction or moral friction—no moment where their obsession with art or arson genuinely endangers the promise. The closing emotional shift feels earned enough but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motivation (to nurture a shared dream and ease entangled memories) is clear and consistent, and her drumming as a coping/connecting tactic is a concrete behavioral anchor. However, her “quietly rebellious” nature is more told than shown, and we see little genuine contradiction or internal struggle beyond wistful sorrow. Emotional states are often summarized in abstract terms (“auroral sorrow,” “deep sense of connection”) rather than grounded in specific, character-particular sensations or memories. The final sense of peace is plausible but largely declared instead of earned through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The maintenance worker has a clear, consistent motive and some professional texture, but her inner life remains thin and largely unconflicted. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses in play. Her thrill-seeking “calculated spontaneity” is asserted more than tested. The final satisfaction feels low-cost and mildly pat rather than earned through pressure on her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    The guardian and the figure remain archetypal, with almost no interiority beyond reiterated calm and mystery. Motivation is baldly stated (“driven by a desire to teach darkness the value of stars”) rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. The only real action choice—the guardian reaching out a hand and tracing patterns—doesn’t clearly cost them anything or complicate their state. As a result, the closing “understanding” feels more declared than earned from character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s core motivation—to foster “forests of second thoughts” via a humble rebellion—is clear and consistent, but it remains almost entirely untested. Interiority leans on abstract formulations (“sense of purpose,” “amplified quiet determination”) rather than embodied, character-specific feeling. There’s no true internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he never doubts, fears, or miscalculates. His final stance mirrors his initial one, so change is more expansion than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael’s longing for heritage and freedom is legible and consistent, and the whale-call plunge is a clear, if somewhat preordained, choice. However, her inner life leans on generalized language (“insatiable hunger to find freedom,” “true nature”) rather than character-specific contradiction under pressure. The shift from dock worker to “guardian of the sea’s secrets” feels more declared than earned through concrete struggle. The emotional cost of shedding her past is gestured at but never made specific enough to feel cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    Echo is clearly sketched—a solitary, ritual-bound performer whose art is an emotional coping mechanism—but interiority remains abstract and generalized. We’re told they are morally ambiguous and emotionally barren, yet we don’t see specific, pressured choices that complicate or expose those traits. The most concrete action, bringing home the bouquet, happens without dramatized hesitation or contradiction. As a result, Echo feels more like an emblem than a fully lived character.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra has a clear artistic motivation and a consistent sensibility, but she remains largely emblematic—a “cloud-shadow poet” more than a psychologically particular person. Her change (from constrained to liberated) is told rather than enacted through difficult, value-testing choices. Internal conflict is minimal; she never seriously hesitates or risks anything tangible to gain this revelation. The result is an effective lyric presence but not yet a fully realized character for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.8)
    The painter and glassblower are sketched in broad strokes with clear but largely untested motives; “innocently cunning” and colorblindness are told rather than dramatized in specific, pressured choices. Emotional interiority is thin and mostly abstract—he “began to awaken to the beauty around him” without a concrete conflict or cost attached. The relationship between painter and glassblower is harmonious from the outset and never truly functions as a crucible, so any change in them feels low-stakes. The closing state reads more like a narrated ideal than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    The bell ringer’s core trait (curiosity/gentleness) and motivation are clear, but they face no real opposition, and we never see contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is largely summarized (“felt a deep sense of connection”) rather than dramatized through specific, character-particular perceptions or choices. Their “journey of self-discovery” is asserted, not earned through difficult decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mourning jewelry maker has a clear, consistent motivation, but their inner life remains generalized and abstract rather than particularized and conflicted. We’re told they hit rock bottom and seek healing, yet we never see a specific failure, regret, or contradictory impulse tested on the page. The shift from despair to peace feels narratively declared more than earned through dramatized micro-choices. As a result, the final emotional change lands, but with limited depth or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer’s motivation—to decode lost cultural patterns after the crashes—is clear and consistent, but largely uncontested and un-pressured. Interiority is generalized (“sense of purpose,” “solace”) rather than particularized into contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. There is no real internal conflict or visible cost to her choices, only a calm continuation of a preexisting path. The ending’s “quiet satisfaction” feels earned but low-stakes, more a mood than a transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Her drive for forbidden knowledge is clear and consistent, and we get some interior texture (“anguished joy”) around the pagoda and vision. However, she rarely makes pressured choices—accepting and using the pagoda is essentially unopposed—and there’s little genuine contradiction or moral friction. Emotions are often labeled rather than embodied, and “steadily unpredictable curiosity” is told, not dramatized. The colleague is purely functional, adding no relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dusk noticer has a clear, consistent motive (to understand and preserve hope) and a recognizable temperament, but her inner life remains idealized and largely unconflicted. Emotions are often labeled (“felt a sense of luminous regret”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. Her final decision to share her findings is motivated but low-cost and not deeply dramatized. Overall she reads as an archetype more than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lena’s vocation, doubt, and wish to re-balance her values are clearly sketched, but mostly in generalized, abstract language rather than through concrete, pressured choices. We get a sense of her gentleness and introspection, yet her internal conflict rarely manifests as simultaneous, competing impulses in a specific moment. The “con” that sparked her crisis is gestured at but never dramatized, so its psychological pressure feels thin. Her shift toward renewed purpose at the end is plausible but emotionally under-earned because very little on-page struggle precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s core motivation (“closure seeker,” wanting to read “stories in scars”) is clear and consistent, and their comfort in oppressive silence plus the reopened wound give some texture. However, their interiority stays mostly at the level of abstract yearning and awe, with little contradiction, moral tension, or specific personal stake beyond generic curiosity. The final sense of “closure” feels declared rather than earned through a visible internal conflict or costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The crystal gazer has a clear desire (to uncover “where this love was stored”), but they mostly function as a receptive vessel for symbolism rather than a pressured, choice-making character. Emotions are largely summarized (“felt an inexplicable pull,” “mind reeling”) rather than embodied in specific, contradictory reactions. The final “newfound understanding” reads as an unearned epiphany because we don’t see any real internal struggle or alternative impulses tested. This limits the sense of genuine change or cost in their arc.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dreamer’s motivation (freeing her trapped creativity) is clear and consistent, but she remains more archetype than individuated person. Interiority leans on generalized awe and receptivity (“moonstruck dreamer,” “attuned to the universe’s subtle language”) rather than character-specific contradictions or embodied conflict. The final change—renewed purpose—is asserted more than earned through dramatized struggle, with little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.0)
    Asa has a clear role and goal, but her interiority is thin and largely summarized (“dreamless freight guard,” “her motivation was clear”) rather than dramatized through conflicted, character-specific impulses. She rarely faces a difficult choice; the process of merging with and then leaving the dune happens without visible hesitation or cost. Actions do align with her stated task, yet we don’t get a strong sense of her personal stakes beyond duty. The result is competent but emotionally undercharged characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The philosopher has a clear desire—to explore his mind and understand his translocations—but his inner life stays abstract and largely unconflicted. Emotions are mostly labeled as curiosity and wonder rather than embodied in specific, pressured moments. The apparent “change” at the end (perspective shifted) is asserted rather than earned through difficult choices on the page. As a result, he feels more like a vessel for mood than a fully realized, contradictory individual.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    Eira and the travelers have clear, simple motivations (guiding and seeking courage), but they remain archetypal rather than individualized. Interiority is almost nonexistent; we’re told about resolve and trepidation without concrete, character-specific thought or embodied reaction. There’s no visible internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page, only a smooth progression from uncertainty to determination. As a result, the closing “threshold of a new world” feels conceptually earned but not emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.3)
    The bellhop has a clear role, vow, and internal question (the cost of safety) but their interiority leans abstract and generalized rather than embodied and particular. We rarely see contradictory impulses in action; doubt and acceptance are mostly told in summary. The fleeting connection with the figure hints at deeper conflict but isn’t dramatized enough to feel like a crucible moment. The final “choice” to see silence as strength reads more like a narrated conclusion than a pressured decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.0)
    Kael’s motivation (unmask the pretender, protect reality) is clear and consistent, and their patience/rigor read believably, but interiority is thin and largely summarized rather than dramatized. We rarely feel embodied emotion beyond “quiet excitement” at the end, so their cost and doubt never really land. The pretender is a cipher, appearing only at the very end with no particular voice or presence. As a result, the final unmasking feels more like a plot function than a clash of fully realized people.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s core motivation (understanding disappearing paths/rhythms of the sea) is clear and consistent, and her actions—assembling the drum, poring over logbooks, making a new map—align with it. However, her interiority remains relatively generalized and serene; we don’t see sharp contradictions or real internal pressure. The realization that “the truth she sought was not in the maps or the data, but in the rhythms of the sea itself” feels more granted than earned through struggle. As a result, she reads as a well-framed, but somewhat undifferentiated, lyric protagonist rather than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stargazer’s motivation (to rekindle her purpose and the rebellion) is clear and consistent, but largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. “Awkwardly confident” appears as a label with only light behavioral evidence and no real cost. Her transformation at the circle is swift and unresisted, which blunts the sense of internal conflict. The ending resolve feels emotionally plausible but somewhat under-earned at this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    Akira is vivid on paper—an insurgent grandmother telepathic with plants—but her interiority stays mostly straightforwardly determined, with little contradictory impulse or real doubt. Her motive (find the embryo, fulfill destiny) is clear yet untested by any real on-page cost or moral friction. The peak choice (unsealing the orb) feels inevitable and unconflicted, so the “change” at the end is more coronation than earned shift. Strong concept, modest emotional and psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Amira’s motivation—to find peace after the drone strike—is clear and consistent, and her bodily responses (breath, shoulders, nerves) are at least partially embodied. However, the emotional progression is unusually smooth and tidy for such severe trauma, with limited contradiction or flare-ups once she reaches the cliff. Phrases like “anchor optimism in realism” and “quietly talented at finding solace” feel summary-like and abstract rather than earned through specific, pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The artist’s motive—rebuilding her sense of reality and purpose through art—is clear, but she remains largely archetypal, with few concrete, individuating details. Her main micro-choice (to methodically untangle the threads) aligns with that motive yet faces little real internal resistance. Emotions are often labeled in elevated language (“crestfallen,” “luminescent ache”) rather than embodied through particular sensations or memories. The final “change” in her is asserted more than felt as a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael has a clear goal and a few specific traits (albino, “serene anger,” fixation on time dilation), but their interiority stays summarized and largely generic. Emotional states are labeled more than embodied, and the “deep connection” and newfound understanding at the end feel asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The missing person remains mostly an abstract figure or symbol. The final shift toward “newfound appreciation” lacks a visible cost or hard choice that would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria has a clear role and stated motivation, but her interiority leans on abstractions (“bravely conflicted heart”) rather than dramatized contradictory impulses. Her choice to disseminate the letter feels lightly contested and comes with minimal on-page struggle. Emotions are often labeled (“pride and trepidation”) rather than embodied in specific behavior. The change from archivist to revolutionary is asserted more than earned through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s pacifism, attachment to the roses, and rejection of her father’s path are clear and consistent, and the sword on the wall is a solid emblem of her renunciation. However, nearly all of this is told rather than dramatized through in-scene micro-choices. Internal conflict is minimal: she never seriously wavers or faces a live test of her values. The final “choice” to remain as she is reads as a reaffirmation without felt cost, keeping the arc shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fisher has a clear, consistent motive and a few distinct behaviors (cool-headed, transliterating emotions), but she remains largely emblematic rather than individuated. There’s little contradiction or internal conflict under pressure; she never faces a real dilemma. Her emotional response to the goddess’s echo is summarized (“her heart sang”) rather than embodied in a specific, character-particular way. The closing “renewed spirit” feels unearned because we haven’t seen what it costs her to seek or what specifically changes in her.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Adelaide’s core motivation (protecting the family legacy by seeking truth) is clear and consistent, and her choice to pursue the scandal provides a modest internal shift from burden to purpose. However, she faces almost no articulated internal contradiction—her impulses largely align, so the “regret vs duty” tension never really sharpens. Emotion is mostly summarized in abstractions (“weight of this legacy,” “sense of purpose”) rather than embodied. The final determination feels plausible but low-cost and somewhat over-declared.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tattooist is emotionally legible—haunted by guilt, seeking peace through her work—but her guilt is abstract, with no specific past act to complicate her choices. Her key decisions (using the cord, reinterpreting the haunted firmware) feel motivated yet not deeply contested on the page. Interiority is pleasant but somewhat generalized, relying on summary (“The dissonance of old guilt had been haunting her for years”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift toward peace arrives smoothly, without much visible internal struggle in the decisive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The artist’s interiority is consistent—unlearning, searching for meaning, oscillating between unease and peace—but it’s largely summarized rather than dramatized through distinct, character-specific contradictions. Her key choices (altering the mandala, accepting lingering unease, stepping into the mist) track logically with her motives, yet they lack sharp, individuating detail beyond generic “spiritual seeker.” Feelings are often labeled (“lilac unease,” “turmoil”) instead of embodied in more idiosyncratic perceptions or behaviors. The final sense of resolution is earned but mild, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motive—to “cradle empathy in arms of steel”—is clearly stated and consistent, but we rarely see it tested against resistance or contradictory impulses. Her emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and there’s little concrete behavior beyond walking, remembering, and declaring. The “gentle radical” label is evocative but not deeply dramatized in distinct, character-specific choices. The final sense of purpose is therefore credible but not hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    Echo’s core desire for an encore and eventual peace is clear and consistent, but we largely get her as a concept (“stage ghost,” “synesthetically blessed”) rather than as a psychologically specific person under pressure. Her emotional beats lean on generalized nostalgia and longing without much contradiction or textured interior conflict. The key turn—finding peace through the coin and echoes—feels inevitable but not deeply earned because we haven’t seen her struggle with a genuine alternative. As a result, the endurance/closure reads more like fable logic than character-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Luna’s blend of artist and scientist, plus her “affectionate skepticism” and reliance on somatic markers, gives her some specificity and grounding. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal contradiction or hard choice; her curiosity is never meaningfully at odds with fear or cost. Much of her interiority is labeled rather than dramatized (“Her motivation was clear…”), which flattens complexity. The final sense of growth and peace is asserted more than earned through difficult micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria has a clear vocation and desire “to become the voice of the unknown,” and her attachment to the fossil adds a bit of texture, but her emotional range stays narrow—mostly wonder and contentment. There is almost no internal contradiction or real doubt under pressure. Her closing sense of peace feels unearned because no meaningful cost or test of that identity appears. As a result, she reads more as a role plus aura than as a fully individuated psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The turner’s motivation is repeatedly declared (to preserve, to prophecy, to uncover truth) but never really pressured or complicated, so we learn little beyond a generic spiritual diligence. Interiority stays abstract—no embodied emotion, doubt, or contradictory impulses—and there are no real micro-choices under strain. The “quietly inspired” trait is told rather than dramatized. The ending realization that prophecy is “raw possibility” feels announced rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    The spy’s core desire (to mend what’s broken and reclaim courage) is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans on generic phrasing (“she felt a sense of peace,” “a sense of hope”) rather than character-specific contradiction. The burns and profession rarely affect concrete choices, reading more as labels than live constraints. The encounter with her other self has emotional potential but lands as a smooth epiphany without much dramatized struggle. Overall she feels coherent but not deeply particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The coachman has a clear interior motivation (his “vow…to distill complexity into essence”) and a consistent contemplative temperament, but he rarely faces pressure that forces difficult or contradictory choices. The young woman is more emblem than character. His final sense of satisfaction feels like an extension of mood rather than the culmination of a tested flaw or conflict. Characterization is specific and coherent but emotionally low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Akira is sketched with a coherent sensibility—gentle, contemplative, drawn to kindness—but she rarely encounters genuine friction or contradiction. Her “resistance to change” is stated rather than dramatized through competing impulses or costly decisions. The key shift (leaving with the lantern glass and a new understanding) feels mild and largely consequence-free. As a result, she reads more as a thematic device than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The gardener’s motive—to tend hidden beauty and “reflect light into the dark corners of the city”—is clear and consistent but mostly stated rather than dramatized under pressure. Interiority is pleasant yet generic, with little contradiction or sharp individuality beyond “wistfully pragmatic.” The lockmaster backstory hints at a more complex identity but never forces a difficult choice or visible cost. The closing sense of deepened connection to the city feels lightly earned but emotionally low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is present but largely summarized in abstract terms (“brittle awakenings,” “translate the isolation… into independence”) rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured choices. Her past-life memory and role as keeper of knowledge are evocative traits, yet they don’t generate visible contradiction or on-page struggle—she remains serenely contemplative throughout. The shift at the end toward “new understanding” feels more declared than earned by specific micro-decisions. As a result, she reads as a mood-vector more than a fully inhabited, conflicted person.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena has a clear desire (to understand connections) and a distinct angle (love-letter ghostwriter/keeper of secrets), but most of this is told rather than dramatized. Her whimsy and curiosity are asserted, with few concrete, pressured micro-choices revealing contradiction or cost. The final realization about creating the thread feels somewhat neat and unresisted. Character is coherent and pleasant but not yet deep or particular enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lyra’s goal and competence are clear, but she experiences almost no genuine doubt, contradiction, or cost as she works, so she reads more as a role than a fully inhabited person. Her “cautiously hopeful” nature is told rather than dramatized in a hard choice. The victory comes too easily to reveal deeper flaws or blind spots. The final sense of calling feels unearned because we’ve not seen her risk anything meaningful to get there.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra’s motivation (the long search for the lost chronicles/key) is clear and consistent, and her claustrophobia plus “prudently adventurous” nature sketch a plausible profile. However, these traits rarely create on-page friction—she doesn’t visibly struggle with the tunnels, and her prudence never forces a hard choice. Her emotional arc (claustrophobia melting into cosmic freedom) comes largely as a bestowed effect of the crystal rather than a conflicted decision. The interiority is serviceable but somewhat generic, with few idiosyncratic thoughts or embodied contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characters are clear but largely emblematic: “face blind artist” and “detective haunted by cold cases” function as roles more than deeply individuated people. Motivation (awakening empathy, thawing numbness) is asserted rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The artist’s interior shift is explained in abstract terms (“lance the boil of her own emotional numbness”) without much embodied ambivalence or friction on the page. The relationship remains cordial and static; no pressure tests their values or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s core motive (honoring her ancestor) and a few traits (idealistic, nervously confident) are clear but largely told rather than earned through specific, pressured choices. Her interiority circles the same realizations (“questioning her own identity,” “drawn into the sailor’s world”) without concrete, character-particular reactions. We get almost no embodied emotion beyond shivers and generalized dread. By the end, her stance has not clearly shifted in a way that forecloses an option or reveals a new, specific flaw or strength.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The fiddler has a defined role and some interiority (secrets, guilt about the hitchhiker, urge to tell), but most of it is summarized rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices. Motivation skews abstract—“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—instead of being grounded in a specific, personal want with clear stakes. We never see real contradictory impulses clash on the page; the shift from weighed-down to purposeful happens with little resistance. The result is a sketched arc rather than a fully inhabited character.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael has a coherent backstory and sensibility (highway robber’s son turned failed founder drawn to “forgotten pathways”), but his interiority stays abstract and largely unembodied. We’re told his “perceptively calm nature” and disillusionment more than we feel them through specific, pressured choices. His shift toward wanting to “dissuade others” lands conceptually but without a visible internal struggle or cost. Overall, he reads more like a thematic mouthpiece than a fully dramatized person.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s motivation (decode inscriptions to relieve present burdens) is clear and consistent, but she remains idealized and largely untroubled by internal contradiction. Her emotions are told in generalized terms (“sense of purpose,” “midnight solace”) rather than embodied specifics, which flattens her under pressure. We see almost no genuine struggle or competing impulses; she simply reaffirms what she already believes. The final “change” is a mild renewal of determination, with little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The druid’s goal and core trait (“ability to find lost things”) are clear, but interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, so they feel more like a role than a person. Emotions like “trepidation and determination” and “warlike serenity” are labeled rather than embodied in concrete, contradictory behavior. The reunion with the frozen figure from the past skims over what that relationship means, blunting what could be a crucial character crucible. The ending realization lands conceptually but without a strong sense of personal cost or change rooted in their specific flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motivation and trait set (“root-bound visionary,” “purposefully curious”) are clear and consistently aligned with her actions, but she faces little real resistance or inner contradiction. Her choice to enter the maze and touch the tree reads as inevitable rather than pressured, so there’s no felt cost or moral tension. Interiority is present but abstractly phrased; we rarely see a conflicted or degraded thought process under stress. The closing readiness “to explore them all” feels more like a continuation of her baseline than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent—she comes to heal herself and follows through—but “reckless idealist” never becomes more than a label, and her inner life stays generalized (“holes in her soul,” “darkness within her”) rather than embodied in specific contradictions or blind spots. Her spellcasting proceeds without any real friction or error, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. The final sense of peace feels under-earned because there’s little dramatized struggle or cost on the way there.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jack’s core situation and dissatisfaction are clear, and his profession/backstory give him some specificity. However, his interiority leans heavily on generalized, stock phrasing (“spark of determination,” “void,” “newfound resolve”) rather than character-particular perception. The internal conflict between craving quiet and missing the road is stated more than dramatized, so his late resolve feels relatively low-cost and easy. The public failure that supposedly drives his arc is told in a single vague line, weakening motivation and the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara’s intellectual motivation is clear and consistent, but she remains largely a flat archetype—“kindly,” “methodical,” “gift for analogical thinking”—without embodied contradiction or concrete behavior under pressure. Her interiority is almost entirely summary-level cognition (“she began to ponder,” “she realized”), with little specific sensory or emotional texture. The “change” at the end is an untroubled shift from seeking to having basically succeeded, with no visible cost or renunciation. Overall, she reads more as a vessel for theme than as a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The librarian’s core disposition and ethos (mechanical/organic blend, preserving wonder, tidal identity) are clear, but they’re largely asserted rather than tested. We rarely see concrete micro-choices under pressure—movements are framed as “meditation” and “deliberate dance,” not as decisions with competing impulses. The moon-phase fluctuation and migrating identity are described but never force an on-page trade-off. As a result, endurance at the end feels more like a static state than earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria has a clear emotional throughline—her pull toward the pearl and connection—but her interiority stays abstract and generalized (“walls that had been built around her own heart”) rather than character-specific. Her profession as a doomsday bunker inspector never meaningfully colors her perceptions or choices. The final expansion of her heart is stated rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured micro-choices, which keeps the change from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara has a clear role, goal, and sensibility (river chronicler seeking self-forgiveness), and her attention to the map/accordion gives her a recognizable temperament. However, her guilt and need for forgiveness are gestured at in the abstract; we never see the specific wrong or a concrete test of her resolve. Internal conflict is minimal—she mostly affirms the same realization about forgiveness being a journey. The stopping of medication is a potentially rich, fraught trait that never meaningfully complicates her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dreamer’s core motivation (to find the library of unspoken words) is clear and consistent, and their actions broadly align with it. However, interiority leans abstract (“a motivation that had been burning within them”) rather than concretely embodied. We don’t see contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict; they never doubt, resist, or misstep. The final realization that the library is “a state of being” lands as an epiphany more stated than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s vocation, belief in the violin, and sense of obligation to her dream versus the empire are clear, but they remain at a summarized, abstract level. We’re told she feels a “mulberry ache” and is torn, yet we rarely see concrete, character-specific contradictions (e.g., a precise temptation or fear) play out in action. Her final determination to step into the unknown feels emotionally plausible but lightly earned, since no specific path is actually foreclosed on the page. As a result, she reads more as a vessel for mood and concept than as a fully individuated person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s core motivation—to complete one last act of beauty before surrendering to “stillness”—is clear and sustained, and there is a credible inner pull between obliteration and craft. However, her interiority tends toward abstract spiritual language rather than concrete, character-specific feeling, which flattens complexity. The “beautician mortician” role is evocative but underused to reveal moral or emotional contradiction. Her final readiness for the threshold feels more asserted than earned through dramatized struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s core traits (caretaker, kindly decisive seeker of contentment) are clear and consistent, and her bond with the plants and hairpin gives her some specificity. However, her interiority leans on generalized reflection rather than concrete, embodied contradiction or on-page struggle. There is little sense of competing impulses—she moves calmly from care to contemplation to epiphany without visible friction or cost. The final “change” into contentment feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.6)
    The conscience remains more an emblem than a fully inhabited person: we’re told their nature (“sincerely insincere,” “protected vulnerability”) but rarely see concrete, pressured choices that reveal contradictions. Motivation is clear but abstract—“to welcome nuance into certainty”—and the emotional process of engaging with this troubled client is mostly summarized. The brief flicker of self-recognition in the shard is the most compelling character beat, but it arrives late and lightly. Overall, interiority is thematic rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.0)
    The researcher has a clear surface motivation (to teach) and the student visibly progresses, but both remain generic archetypes with almost no individuating detail. “Backwards aging” is never dramatized or tied to her inner life. There’s no real internal conflict, ambivalence, or cost to the lesson for either party. The final “change” is an untroubled understanding rather than a pressured, character-revealing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The skimmer has a clear desire—to “learn to navigate without moving”—and a consistent contemplative disposition, but there is almost no internal contradiction or pressured choice. Its “historically reverent nature” is told rather than dramatized, and emotional states remain abstract (“serene contemplation,” “weathered resolve”) rather than embodied. The only real change is the integration of the wandering pulse, but this happens without visible struggle or cost. As characterization, it functions, but it does not yet reach the complexity expected for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eira has a clear motivation and interiority—the fear of creative withering in an automated world—but much of it is told in thesis-like sentences rather than dramatized under pressure. Her choices (exploring, touching, unstrapping) align with her goal but happen without significant hesitation or contradictory impulses. The “underachieving” trait never meaningfully complicates her tactics; she succeeds too smoothly. The final renewal feels emotionally plausible but lightly earned given the lack of real struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael has a clear, simple motivation and some embodied reaction (“heart quickened”), but his interiority stays generic and unconflicted: he never wavers, doubts, or pays a visible price for this quest. The role of “keeper of the luminous vows” doesn’t alter his behavior in a specific way. His emotional progression is largely flat—curiosity to wonder to a tidy epiphany—with no contradictory impulses under pressure. The final change (“he knew that he would never see the world in the same way again”) feels asserted rather than earned through concrete, character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    The decision maker has a consistent, gentle obsession with deciphering the prophecy, but their psychology remains abstract and archetypal rather than individuated. Motivation—to align with cosmic purpose—is clear but largely untested by resistance or competing desires. The final act of drinking the droplet follows logically yet lacks a palpable sense of cost or inner struggle. Emotional states (“quietly enthusiastic,” “stellar doubt”) are repeated rather than deepened into contradiction or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    The reaper’s longing and grief are clear, but rendered mostly in generalized emotional summary (“their heart remained heavy”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Their core motive—to understand sacrifice and nameless fears—drives the choice to crystallize echoes, but that choice is never sharply tested or complicated. Internal conflict (duty vs. heartbreak, curiosity vs. pain) is implied rather than dramatized in specific micro-choices. The quiet endurance at the end counts as a small Earned Stasis, but the cost is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mage’s motivation (“to right a cosmic imbalance”) is clear, but interiority remains generalized and largely untested by resistance. “Lukewarm” and “earnestly naive” are labels rather than dramatized contradictions, so we never see them grapple with doubt or fear mid-ritual. Micro-choices (deciding on the dripping method, persisting through the ritual) are present but frictionless. The end pride and sense of purpose feel more declared than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    The warden has a clear, decent motivation (to help the community heal) but very little individuating texture beyond that, and almost no contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional states are largely summarized rather than embodied, and we don’t see concrete costs or risks to them in the present. Micro-choices (picking up the label, deciding to walk and photograph) feel generic, not deeply character-specific. The ending doesn’t register as a change in the warden so much as a restatement of who they already were.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s curiosity, reverence for the orchard, and goal of harmonizing logic and intuition are clear and consistent, and her choice to experiment with the crystal tracks with those traits. However, her interior life leans on declarative summary (“The touch of wonder was something Elara cherished”) rather than embodied, character-specific conflict. We rarely see contradictory impulses (risk vs. caution, logic vs. intuition) actually tugging her in scene. The closing sense of peace is pleasant but largely costless, so the arc feels more affirmed than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lyra has a clear role and competence (midnight pattern seeker, former cloud jumper), but her interiority rarely moves beyond reiterated duty, burden, and trust. Almost no contradictory impulses appear on the page—she is simply diligent and resolute—so we don’t see value trade-offs or real emotional friction. Her “change” by dawn is effectively that she’s tired but proud, a small shift that doesn’t feel hard-won. The parachute buckle hints at a deeper past and fear, but that tension is invoked rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaito’s motivation (defeating numbness, resolving his “duplicate” identity) is clear and consistent, but his emotional life is mostly told in abstract terms (“identity crisis,” “emotional numbness”) rather than embodied specifics. Internal conflict is described as something he had rather than something he’s actively wrestling with in scene; there are few moments of simultaneous, contradictory impulse. The shift from turmoil to peace at the end feels more asserted than earned through concrete struggle. Overall he reads more like a thematic function than a fully particular person.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The proprietor has a clear core trait (receptive, imaginative) and goal (protecting her escape rooms as spaces of innovation), and her choice to turn the mystery into a design project is coherent. However, her interiority is mostly summarized in abstract terms (“sense of purpose,” “motivation”) rather than rendered through concrete, character-specific contradictions. There’s little genuine internal conflict or cost—she’s curious, then inspired, without friction. The ending change (new theme, renewed purpose) is pleasant but lightly earned and emotionally thin for a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maestro Elwes has a clear, consistent motivation (restore laughter) and a defined vocation, but he remains largely an emblem rather than a psychologically specific person. Interiority is almost entirely summarized (“poured his heart into the performance”) instead of rendered through distinct thoughts or embodied contradictions. There is no real internal conflict or competing impulse under pressure. His slight softening at the end registers as change, but it’s generic and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The guardian’s mood and burden are clear, and there is a credible shift from crushing responsibility to a tentative peace. However, interiority leans abstract (“dimensionally homesick,” “make friends with uncertainty”) rather than grounded in character-specific memories or embodied reactions. We get few concrete micro-choices under pressure beyond “waiting” and opening herself to the mist. Her change feels plausible but somewhat costless and generalized rather than idiosyncratically hers.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to interrupt a stifling destiny through creative destruction—is clear, but the inner life remains abstract and largely declarative. We’re told they are “hopeless” and “stoically sensitive,” yet we rarely see embodied conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. The experiment succeeds without visible emotional degradation or irrationality; there’s awe and trepidation at the end but little cost. The final sense of “true calling” feels under-earned because we haven’t watched them struggle through a real dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s vocation and curiosity are clear, but she reads more as a vessel for mood than a fully individuated person with contradictions. Her motivation to “uncover hidden truths” is repeated rather than deepened through specific, pressured choices. Emotional states tend toward generalized wonder and awe rather than embodied, idiosyncratic reactions. The final “change” (carrying the memory and being guided to the next mystery) feels gentle and low-cost, more stated than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara has a clear core—curious, hopeful, duty-bound—and her choice to step into the unknown tracks with her established fascination with patterns and parallel timelines, but she faces little real internal contradiction or cost. Her “resilient positivity” is asserted rather than tested, so emotions rarely move beyond calm wonder and mild trepidation. Marcus exists mainly as a warm voice on the radio, not as a crucible relationship. The final choice feels consistent but not deeply earned or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The architect has a clear, consistent motivation—seeking “rational enchantment” and the “texture of connection”—but we learn almost nothing character-specific beyond those abstractions. Her emotions are mostly labeled (“unsettling calm,” “mesmerized”) rather than embodied in idiosyncratic ways. There’s no real internal contradiction or difficult micro-choice under pressure; she simply follows the guiding thread. The final “change” feels more like reiterated statement than an earned, costly shift in her character.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lyra’s motivation as a devoted navigation instructor and explorer of cosmic mysteries is clear, but she faces no concrete resistance or conflicting impulse on the page. Her emotions are mostly summarized (pride, wonder, purpose) rather than embodied in specific, pressured choices. There is no visible internal contradiction or cost to her stance. The result is a coherent but flat characterization lacking the complexity expected at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aria’s role and broad motivation are clear, but her interiority remains generalized—“persistently curious” and “sense of responsibility” are told rather than dramatized with concrete, character-specific contradiction. The grieving woman is reduced largely to tears and desperation; we get little about her beyond the search for her sister. Aria’s “change” at the end is essentially a reaffirmation of what we’re told she already does, with minimal visible cost. The lack of textured, idiosyncratic thought under pressure keeps the characterization from feeling truly alive.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra has a clear role, skillset, and mission, and the “claustrophobic spelunker drawn to tight spaces” is intriguingly paradoxical, but the interiority never deepens beyond functional thoughts. Her fear, flaws, or contradictions don’t actually complicate on-page choices; she moves through the facility with near-effortless competence. The motivation “to stand by the unremembered” is stated rather than dramatized through costly decisions. The ending change (“left her changed”) is asserted more than earned by conflicted behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Akira’s motivation—to understand the digital ghost and, ultimately, to fetch wisdom from failure—is clear and consistent, and her final sense of peace reads as a credible internal shift. However, her interiority leans toward generalized, almost interchangeable mystical phrasing rather than character-particular thought. We rarely see contradictory impulses in play; she moves steadily toward insight without much inner resistance or moral friction. The “death certificate error survivor” detail is evocative but underused as a live psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The storyteller has a clear, consistent motive (preserving the ancients’ whispers), but we get almost no contradictory impulses or embodied emotional texture under pressure. Their interiority is mostly summarized reverence and purpose rather than conflict or specific feeling. The shift from seeking to creating a new lexicon is interesting but arrives without a visible cost or hard choice. The result is archetypal more than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.6)
    Lena’s core motivation (coping with darkness via humor, seeking to restore balance) is clear but mostly told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices. Her emotional shifts—unease, transformation, renewed determination—are summarized in broad terms without embodied contradiction or specific behavior. The herbalist functions as a static guide rather than a pressure source. The final “frostbitten hope” registers as a shift but feels under-earned because we never see Lena genuinely torn or forced into a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Luna’s motivation is clearly stated and consistent—she wants to reawaken beauty—but she faces no real resistance or contradictory impulses on the page. Her inner life is delivered in abstract terms (“fragile beauty,” “mechanical world”) rather than embodied, character-specific feelings. The statues are purely reactive; they do not pressure her or complicate her choices. The final choice to depart feels thematically aligned but emotionally untested, with no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mailman has a clear role and stated motivation, but his inner life is largely summarized rather than dramatized. His desire “to find where broken promises heal” never meaningfully complicates the concrete delivery choice. He faces no real internal conflict at the crossing; he simply executes his plan. The recipient is purely functional, adding no relational or status pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carpenter is consistent—quiet, searching, devoted to craft—but remains mostly an emblem of “quiet persistence” rather than a fully particular person. Motivation (“to interpret silence as possibility”) is clear yet untested by any real cost or contradiction. Their few choices (following the song, returning to work) are gentle shifts instead of pressured decisions. The emotional arc feels told and generalized rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    The librarian has a clear, consistent motivation (to find where stories “live” and reawaken them), but we get almost no contradiction or internal tension—her desire is never tested. Interiority is mostly abstract belief statements rather than character-specific thought under pressure. Her emotions (“sense of wonder and awe,” “peace”) are labeled but not deeply embodied or complicated. The final contentment is earned enough for this gentle piece, but the arc lacks felt cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s motivation—to pursue a “runaway dream” via art—is clear and consistent, but mostly told rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured choices. There is almost no internal contradiction or on-page conflict that forces Elian to choose between competing values. Emotional life is abstract (“cipher of longing,” “essence,” “mystique”) rather than embodied in sensory or situational specifics. The closing stance (continuing the pursuit) feels like a restatement of the opening, not a changed or costlier position.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith’s overarching motivation is clear—freeing the trapped idea—but their interiority remains abstract, mostly summarized as “curiosity and determination” without textured contradictions. We don’t see genuine hesitation, fear, or competing impulses that would stress-test this goal. The moment of “improbable longing” at the end is promising but arrives somewhat unearned, more stated than dramatized. The character feels more like a role in an allegory than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s curiosity and professional identity as a folklorist are clear and consistent, and her fascination with the mushroom and the sky matches those traits. However, she faces little real on-page pressure, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or a difficult trade-off. The future loss of memories is told rather than dramatized, which softens the impact of her stated determination. The final “choice” to follow the thread feels more like affirmation of an existing disposition than a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist has clear, specific traits (sorrowful eyes, backward-walking habit, “combative tenderness”) and a coherent motivation to guide the exiled soul, which gives them texture beyond a stock mystic. However, they face little on-page friction: no real opposing impulse challenges their protectiveness, and the emotional arc from anxiety to “quiet triumph” reads smooth rather than hard-won. The habit “slowly subsiding” as tension eases is a nice touch but still doesn’t constitute a meaningful, costly change. The result is vivid but somewhat low-pressure characterization for the level of ambition implied.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aria reads more as an archetypal nature-mage than a fully individuated person; “wise orchard pruner” and “insatiably creative spirit” are labels not dramatized through contradiction or cost. Her motivation to restore balance is clear, but there is no real internal conflict or competing impulse as she works. The final sense of peace feels unearned because nothing has threatened her stance or forced a painful trade-off. Her choices (planting the seed, weaving the spell) are straightforwardly aligned with her stated goal and never challenged.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    The restorer’s core motivation—to ground the spirits—is clear, but her interior life remains thin beyond vocation and purpose. We get little in the way of contradictory impulses or specific, embodied emotion; she rarely feels like more than a functionary of the ritual. Her “lucid unrest” is gestured at but not dramatized in conflicted choices or behavior. The quiet endurance at the end is credible but not deeply earned as a personal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation (a perceptive, methodical listener to maps and silence) is clear and consistent, but remains largely untested—there’s no genuine dilemma or competing impulse on the page. Her emotional shifts (skepticism → awe → peace) are told in broad strokes rather than grounded in specific, pressured micro-choices. The final “sense of peace” feels earned enough for a quiet piece, but the cost of that shift is never really articulated or dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.3)
    Eli’s intellectual drive and melancholy curiosity are clear and consistent, and small physical details (shiver, red-rimmed eyes) keep him somewhat embodied. However, his interiority leans heavily on abstract labels (“sophisticated sorrow”) and tidy formulations rather than felt, scene-specific contradiction. The final “understanding” of letting go arrives as a declared insight more than an earned, pressured choice with visible cost. This keeps the arc interesting but short of the depth and messiness expected at top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The balladeer’s core motivation—to communicate with the “ghost in code” and articulate unspoken needs—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. However, her interiority remains mostly generalized awe and curiosity, with little concrete, character-specific contradiction or cost. The closing sense of “hidden truth about herself” feels asserted rather than deeply earned through dramatized inner conflict. As a result, she reads more as a lyric function than as a fully realized, idiosyncratic person.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s curiosity and empathy are clear and consistent, and her role as a quietly observant, determined servant comes through. However, she rarely faces genuine internal contradiction or pressured choices; she mostly drifts from insight to insight. Emotions skew toward labeled states (“sense of peace,” “quiet understanding”) rather than embodied reactions. The final shift toward peace is pleasant but feels lightly earned because no real conflict has tested her motives.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra has a clear role and motivation—an aviation meteorologist intent on memorializing storms and proving “empty spaces remembered”—but she rarely faces concrete pressure or dilemma. Her emotions are mostly labeled rather than embodied, and we don’t see substantial contradictory impulses in action. The final “calling” realization feels somewhat unearned because nothing on the page really tests or threatens that calling. Characterization is coherent but static and more conceptual than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    The artist has a clear temperament (reverent, meticulous, curious) and a distinctive condition (face blindness), but interior conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in specific moments of doubt or divided impulse. Their motives—to keep working, to open the safe, to engage with the coin—are legible and consistent. However, the emotional effect of the demolition, the coin’s revelation, and the act of leaving remains generalized and could be more embodied. The final stance (departing with “essence” and limits) feels conceptually motivated rather than rooted in a hard personal trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli’s curiosity and diligence are clear and consistent, and their small choices (coaxing the light out, decoding, withholding the discovery) align with those traits. However, there’s almost no internal contradiction or real emotional struggle; excitement rises but never clashes with fear, doubt, or competing values. The “sociable isolation” moment hints at richer interiority but isn’t pushed into conflict. The final stance (“ready to set course for the unknown”) lacks a visible cost or renunciation, so the arc feels mild rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s motivation (“to learn the rhythm of repair”) is clear and consistent, and their choices (studying, decoding, seeking, opening the door) align with it. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or emotional struggle; Kael never wavers, doubts, or pays a visible personal cost. Interiority is mostly summary-level, with little embodied emotion beyond awe and nostalgia. The final sense of “peace” reads as an unearned epiphany because no serious resistance or sacrifice precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to help the settlers tap the nebula for communal flourishing—but it’s presented almost entirely in summary, without embodied interiority or contradictory impulses. Lyra is decorative rather than active; her garden and bell never test her values or force a choice. Emotions are labeled (“comforting,” “trust”) rather than dramatized through specific reactions. The ending offers no visible personal cost or internal shift for any individual, so change feels conceptual rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    The adjuster’s motive—to preserve the universe’s fragile balance—is clear, but it sits at a relatively abstract, saintly level with little friction or contradiction. Interiority is almost entirely reverent summary (“a burden of bruised awe”) rather than embodied or conflicted emotion. We do not see genuine doubt, fear, or selfish impulse complicating their sense of duty. The closing pride and accomplishment are plausible but feel lightly earned because nothing has forced a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (restore orchard / guide travelers), but interiority is thin and generic, with reluctance mentioned then quickly overridden by determination without textured conflict. Emotional beats tend to be labeled (“sense of pride and satisfaction”) rather than embodied in character-specific ways. Her choices track logically, yet we rarely feel contradictory impulses or a personal cost beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maria’s grief, guilt about “the time they had spent apart,” and professional curiosity are clearly laid out and consistent, and the sister backstory gives her a credible emotional center. However, almost everything is told rather than dramatized; we rarely see her making concrete, pressured choices in the present. The resolution from grief to renewed purpose feels somewhat tidy and unresisted, with little sense of contradictory impulses on the page. As a result, the change reads more like a declared insight than a hard-won turn.

    Ember’s curiosity, professional creed, and longing for meaning are clear, and the micro-choice not to incise the bottle is consistent with those traits. However, her interiority leans on generalized calm/clarity rather than distinct, embodied contradiction, and the “profound realization” arrives with little dramatized struggle. The cost of her choice (preservation over transgression) is only lightly felt. She reads more as a vessel for the premise than an irreducible individual.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to sand down others’ painful memories—is clear and consistent, and her profession and ability are well integrated. However, her interiority leans on declarative summary (“Elara’s goal was…”) rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses in scene. The choice to walk into the pavilion and take on its remorse comes quickly and without much visible ambivalence or cost. As a result, the final change feels more asserted than deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.0)
    Emilia has clear traits (harmonious, empathetic, visionary) but they are mostly told rather than dramatized, and she faces no genuine opposition or dilemma. Her “decisiveness” never meets resistance, so there’s little sense of cost or internal contradiction. The kinship with the cuckoo weight and her mission to bridge silos hint at depth but never move beyond emblematic gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to unlock “entangled memories” and become an “archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is clear and consistent, and her competence fits the role of an engineer. However, nearly all of this is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is thin: she is “exhilarated and unsettling” but never faces a consequential dilemma or contradiction that changes her tactics. Her transformation at the end is asserted more than earned through visible struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist’s curiosity and determination are clear and consistent, and her profession-specific lens (reading doodles as maps, recognizing threshold phenomena) gives her some individuality. However, her inner life remains largely unconflicted: she feels an “intense urge” and follows it without any visible ambivalence or cost. The emotional palette stays narrow—wonder, purpose, responsibility—without textured contradiction under pressure. Her final “sense of purpose” feels somewhat pre-declared rather than earned through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sculptor has a clear, consistent motivation and a gentle sense of vocation, but interiority remains schematic and largely summarized (“driven by a deep motivation”) rather than textured or conflicted. There is no real internal contradiction or difficult choice; the work seems to cost them nothing. Emotions are mostly implied by serene action rather than embodied with specificity. The closing smile lands, but feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor’s exile, method, and vow give him a clear, coherent inner life, but his emotions remain mostly labeled rather than embodied and rarely show genuine contradiction. Motivation (to find beauty/meaning in exile) is stated rather than dramatized through tough micro-choices. His final “shift” into purposeful seeker feels more like a reiterated thesis than a costed decision. Overall he reads as an idea-figure more than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s sensibility and pacifist/intuitive traits are clearly established, and her interior focus on empathy is consistent, but she lacks real contradiction under pressure. The decision to violate Lyra’s privacy is under-motivated and treated as benign curiosity rather than a morally fraught act. Emotional states are often labeled (“deep desire,” “sense of purpose”) instead of being fully embodied. The ending’s “new understanding” feels more declared than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra has a clear through-line—ambitious, gifted, seeking “undercurrent of wisdom”—and her actions (buying the seed, tending it, journaling) align with that. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or meaningful doubt, so her final serenity feels like confirmation rather than a hard-won shift. Emotional experience is described more than dramatized under pressure. The future-summary of her renowned apothecary flattens any sense of enduring flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra’s basic motive (curious, competent pilot seeking the orchard’s secret) is clear and consistent, and her professional competence reads credibly. However, her interiority is fairly generic and low-friction: we are told she’s uneasy about inverted gravity, but that never meaningfully complicates a choice. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine risk to her identity or values. The final “changed” state is mostly an informed awe rather than a hard-won reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    Her motivation (understanding the crash / cultivating foresight) is clear and consistent, but she remains more of a role than a fully particular person. Interiority is largely abstract—“precision that bordered on obsession,” “desire to cultivate foresight”—without many idiosyncratic, embodied contradictions or concrete micro-choices under pressure. The patch matters to her in principle, yet her feelings about the crew or any complicating guilt, fear, or doubt never sharpen into a live internal conflict. The ending’s shift to “clarity” and “determination” is plausible but a bit declarative because the emotional cost of that clarity isn’t distinctly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s motivation—to “certify wonder as essential” and unfetter the sculpted hush—is clear and consistent, but she experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her synesthesia and vocation are stated rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices. Emotional texture stays mostly in one serene, reverent register, even at the climax. The final sense of purpose feels more like a restatement than a change earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The relic keeper has a clear through-line—post-guardianship restlessness and a drive to understand failure—but her interiority is abstract and generalized. We never glimpse a specific failure or contradictory impulse; “it was her failures that had taught her the most valuable lessons” gestures at depth without embodying it. Her transformation at the end is asserted (“She felt changed, transformed”) more than dramatized through concrete shifts in perception or choice. The lack of particularized emotional texture keeps her from feeling fully singular or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.0)
    Echo’s obsession and method are clear, but they remain largely a single-note visionary without much on-page contradiction or cost. The “habitually borrowed personalities” trait is told rather than dramatized and never meaningfully alters a choice. Emotional states are mostly labeled (“intensity that bordered on obsession”) rather than embodied in specific, stressed behavior. The final “newfound sense of purpose” feels lightly earned because we haven’t seen genuine internal conflict or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eira has a clear profile (jittery courier, drawn to the liminal, soothed by the pendant), but her motivation never faces a hard test, and she makes no difficult choice on the page. Her emotions are mostly told rather than dramatically embodied (“sense of peace settle over her”), and internal contradiction is faint. The encounter with the aurora-woman hints at deeper potential but stays at the level of a single, unpressured look. The closing sense of purpose feels pleasant rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mystic has a clear, consistent motivation (to commune and to prove objects absorb emotions), but her interiority stays generalized and largely unconflicted. We rarely see contradictory impulses or a real cost to her pursuit; she moves smoothly from intent to revelation. Emotions are more labeled than embodied, leaning on abstractions (“profound truth,” “deep connections”). The final “life-changing” realization feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    The loom spinner’s longing and resolve are clear, but they’re expressed in fairly generic terms (“melancholic reverie,” “deepest longings”) rather than in character-specific perceptions or contradictions. We rarely see her make concrete micro-choices under pressure beyond working the loom and puzzle and then deciding to leave. Her emotional state is largely told and reiterated instead of dramatized through distinctive behavior. The final decision to journey is motivated but feels abstract, with little felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    The blacksmith’s core motivation (to forge resilient beauty from discarded materials) is clear and consistent, and the quiet temperament is well established. However, there’s almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; he wants something, works toward it, and gets it without serious doubt or pressure. The apprentice arrives too late and exerts no real relational or status pressure. As a result, the final “choice” to mentor and explore feels low-cost and emotionally undercharged.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    The map maker has a clear, consistent motivation and a defined professional lens (“sensory map maker”), but her interiority stays abstract and largely interchangeable with any generic seeker of cosmic truth. We’re told she feels excitement, wonder, and clarity, yet we rarely see contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity, cost vs. desire) operating in the moment. Her profession doesn’t meaningfully shape her specific choices beyond a few references to “charting” and “topography.” The final change in her understanding is asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle or conflicted decision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    The skipper’s inner life is coherent—quiet duty, longing for safety, attraction to small luminous things—but largely unlayered and low-contrast. His key choices (pocketing the glass, stacking stones, resolving to protect the lighthouse) align with his traits but never face genuine internal contradiction or cost. The “luminescent ache” feels bestowed rather than earned through a series of pressured decisions. This keeps him from reading as fully three-dimensional at a publishable-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    The herald has a clear, consistent motivation (performing an inherited ritual to steer the dawn), but her inner life stays generic and largely unconflicted. Emotions are labeled rather than embodied (“sense of purpose,” “shadowed elation”) and we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her “joy” and “responsibility” never sharpen into a difficult choice or visible cost. As a result, she reads more as a role or symbol than as a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kaito’s curiosity and quiet obsessiveness come through, especially in his careful manipulation of light and tea, but his inner life remains largely one-note—wonder with only a light brush of “caution.” The donor heart is a massive biographical event that barely shapes his on-page decisions beyond a vague “insatiable curiosity.” There is no real internal contradiction or moment where his motives strain against fear or cost, so his final “understanding” feels low-stakes and somewhat pre-packaged. Overall, he reads more as a thematic vessel than a fully individuated person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    The maintenance worker has a coherent role and a gentle, service-oriented temperament, but remains largely archetypal and emotionally generalized. Motivation (drawn to “broken things,” tending the machinery of the universe) is told rather than pressured into difficult choices. There is little internal contradiction or genuine struggle on the page; the sorrow easing happens smoothly. The final sense of purpose feels pleasant but lightly earned, with minimal visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The memory keeper’s role and overarching motivation (“preserving the memories of a dying realm”) are clear, but her inner life remains abstract and largely unembodied. We rarely see contradictory impulses or a genuinely pressured choice; she moves serenely from duty to hope with minimal frictions. Emotional states are told more than textured through specific, character-particular perception. The final “renewed determination” feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elys is clearly sketched as an empathetic recluse with a coherent inner life and a consistent coping method (“staying while leaving”), and the reframing of the invitation creates a modest but legible change. However, their empathy and past mistake are mostly told rather than dramatized, with little embodied conflict or concrete behavioral contradiction on the page. The emotional shift toward peace is somewhat tidy and untroubled by lingering ambiguity or cost. This keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    The noticer has a clear longing for peace and “absolution,” but her interiority stays abstract—“past transgressions” and guilt are gestured at, never particularized. Her choices (returning to the tea house, savoring the bread) don’t evolve much under pressure, so we don’t see contradictory impulses sharpened by any real test. The gardener functions more as an emblem of care than a person with her own tensions. The ending shift toward gratitude is plausible but feels lightly earned because we never see what it truly costs her to change.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve and interpret the “luminous vows”—is clear and consistent, and her meticulousness is shown through her handling of the slide and records. However, her interiority stays on a generalized, reverent register with little specificity or contradiction, so she never feels fully individuated beyond “devoted archivist.” There is no real internal conflict or difficult trade-off; her realization near the end (“her task was not just to catalog… but to illuminate the path forward”) arrives as a declared epiphany rather than one earned through pressured choices. The result is functional but emotionally low-stakes characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena’s primary motive (find the watch fob/help her father) is clear, but her interiority stays generic—her “curiously steadfast” drive is stated more than embodied in contradictory impulses or costly choices. The relationship with her father and with The Shadow is almost entirely told, not dramatized, so we don’t see status or emotional dynamics under pressure. Her reactions to key beats (recognition of the fob, confronting The Shadow) are too smooth, with little internal conflict or specific embodiment. The claimed “mission success” at the end lacks an on-page decision or sacrifice to make it feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s core motivation—reconciling scientific skepticism with mystical pull and understanding “weather-carriers”—is clear and consistent, and her emotions are at least lightly embodied (shivers, breath, sensory focus). However, her internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized in real-time contradictory impulses, and she rarely faces a choice with visible cost. The shift from “luminous skeptic” to seeker feels largely frictionless once the ring activates and the stranger appears. Her final understanding arrives as a gift rather than something wrestled from genuine resistance or error.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s creative blockage and urge to overcome it are clear, and her choice to draw in the cave tracks with her established traits. However, her interiority leans on generalized language (“auroral sorrow”) rather than precise, idiosyncratic thought, and we see little genuine contradiction or messy ambivalence. The epiphany about the “true key” comes quickly and reads as more declared than earned through struggle. Her final peace feels somewhat tidy, with limited sense of ongoing cost or unresolved flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s core motivation (curiosity and a hunger for candor) is clear and consistent, and her profession colors her perspective. However, her internal conflict is minimal—she never faces a genuinely difficult choice or visible cost. The line about her ink wilting near dishonesty is suggestive but never dramatized as a constraint that complicates her pursuit. The final “newfound sense of purpose” feels somewhat declarative rather than earned through layered, contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    Aria is more a role (harmonious bell tuner) than a fully inhabited person, with almost no interior conflict or embodied emotion. Her only discernible choice—incorporating the iceberg fragment—is frictionless and instantly affirmed by the narrative. Motivation is broad and abstract (“preserve the color of wonder”) and never really tests her. The ending smile reads as a foregone, unearned serenity rather than the outcome of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s motivation to “resolve the inner static” is clear and consistent, and her decision to use the burn as a personal turning point is logically motivated. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“inner static,” “fragmented wholeness”) rather than concrete, character-specific sensations. We rarely see contradictory impulses truly collide in-scene—the struggle is described more than dramatized. The final sense of peace comes quickly and tidily, with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s curiosity and belief in the healing power of listening are clear, but they remain largely declarative, with little embodied contradiction or cost. Her “investigation” unfolds without genuine struggle or moral friction, so we don’t see her tested. The writer is essentially a function, not a character, arriving summarized at the end. The final satisfaction feels unearned because Emilia has not had to choose between competing values or pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria has a clear goal (escape) and a distinct trait set (lyrical, code-breaker, dancer), but her inner life is more stated than dramatized, with little genuine contradiction under pressure. Motivation to "encrypt her vulnerability as strength" is articulated yet never truly contested by a tempting alternative or palpable fear. Her final shift from defiance to "gratitude for the experience" feels unearned because no on-page cost forces that reframing. Overall she reads coherent but somewhat schematic rather than fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lantern lighter has a clear, consistent motivation (to understand/delete memories) and a few concrete traits, but interiority is thin and mostly summarized rather than dramatized. We rarely feel embodied confusion, fear, or conflict when confronting anomalies or the crystal; the journey reads as serene rather than pressured. The final sense of wonder and reclamation is conceptually motivated but emotionally under-earned because we have not seen what losing those memories cost. As a result, the character feels more like a vessel for atmosphere than a fully realized psyche under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    The summoner’s core motivation—to hush the prophecy and restore balance—is clear and consistent, and their actions track logically with that aim. However, interiority remains abstract, with almost no concrete, character-specific emotion or contradiction under pressure. We never see competing impulses or any cost beyond effort, so the final satisfaction feels inevitable rather than earned. The summoner reads more as a ritual functionary than as a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    The tutor and student are clearly sketched but remain fairly archetypal: the kindly mentor, the eager acolyte. Motivation is stated plainly (curiosity, desire for “secrets”) rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Emotional states are mostly told (“eyes sparkled with curiosity,” “sense of satisfaction washing over him”) with little contradiction or textured interiority. The final “connection” the tutor feels lands more as a sentiment than an earned, conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s core motivation—using the shell to reclaim buried memory and reframe isolation as independence—is clear and consistent, and the basic arc from avoidance to acceptance tracks. However, her interiority leans on abstract labels (“sense of resolve,” “profound longing”) rather than embodied, idiosyncratic feeling. The “charmed skeptic” tension is asserted but never meaningfully dramatized in her choices under pressure. The transformation at the end feels earned in outline, but not deeply individualized or emotionally costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    The forger’s core motivation—to “forgive the unfinished” and subvert an unjust document—is clear but largely told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. She never faces a credible internal dilemma or external pushback over committing “calibrated treason,” so her mastery feels frictionless. Interiority is generic, with little contradiction or specificity beyond reverence for her craft. The closing sense of peace is conceptually earned but not bought with visible cost or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation (to understand why people “echo”) is clear, but she experiences almost no resistance or genuine dilemma, so we see little of her under pressure. Her interiority is largely abstract (“she knew,” “she felt”) rather than embodied in specific, character‑particular reactions. There is no visible internal conflict—only a stable, lyrical curiosity—so the final stance to continue the journey costs her nothing. This keeps her from feeling like a fully individuated, high‑literary protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation—salvaging “something pure from the wreckage” and exposing patterns via dreams—is clear and consistent, but it rarely sharpens into concrete, pressured choices on the page. Her interiority is mostly mission-summary and wonder rather than conflicted, embodied emotion. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or real cost when she decides to touch the globe or step into the glacier. As a result, she reads more as a lyrical function than a fully pressured, individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist has a clear sensibility—contemplative, attuned to craft and subtle beauty—but she never faces meaningful pressure or a real dilemma. Motivation (seeking “hidden patterns”) is stated rather than dramatized through hard choices or contradictions. Her emotional journey is mostly a steady, calm appreciation that culminates in a declared epiphany, which feels unearned because nothing truly tests or complicates her. This yields a coherent but thin characterization not yet at publishable depth.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s goal and skillset are clear, but her inner life is mostly told in generic terms (“curiosity was piqued,” “she was driven by a desire to uncover the facts”) rather than dramatized through specific, pressured choices. There’s little contradiction or genuine struggle—she moves from intrigue to wonder without friction or visible cost. Her identity as a “conspiracy debunker” rarely complicates her reactions to the seemingly supernatural discovery. The result is competent but surface-level characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.9)
    The visionary’s motives (sense shifting allegiances, guide a new dawn) are clear but entirely told, not dramatized, and she never faces a concrete, pressured choice. Interiority is generic (“felt a sense of calm,” “sense of pride and accomplishment”) rather than character-particular. There is no visible internal conflict or contradiction; she is serenely right from start to finish. Her “change” at the end (no longer lonely) is asserted but not earned through on-page struggle or decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s motivation (retrospective regret, desire for purpose) is clear and consistent, and his choice to write at the end grows plausibly from the jars and the music box. However, his inner life leans on generalized formulations (“patchwork of lost opportunities and forgotten dreams,” “sweeten the bitter taste of his existence”) instead of more idiosyncratic, embodied contradiction. There’s little sense of genuine internal conflict—he moves from sadness to purpose without a real on-page struggle or competing impulse. The change feels gentle and somewhat preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    Azure’s core motive (protecting and tuning the artifact) is clear and consistent, but she is largely untested—there’s no meaningful opposition to expose deeper contradictions or force costly choices. Her “logically emotional” mind is asserted more than dramatized through conflicted impulses. Interiority is present yet fairly generic, with little idiosyncratic thinking or behavior that would make her feel singular. The closing sense of peace feels earned enough, but it comes cheaply because nothing has truly threatened her goal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The mapper’s motivation (spark a revolution via moon-mapping) is clear but largely asserted rather than revealed through conflicted choices. Interiority is generic—she “felt a surge of determination,” “a thrill of excitement”—with little specificity or contradiction. Her main action (raising her hands to the moon) is symbolically loaded but not meaningfully weighed against risk or fear. The result is a functional but not yet vividly individual character.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    Maya’s core motivation—to solve a preventable death and free herself from her past—is clear and consistent, and the final internal shift to “peace” feels broadly earned. However, her emotional life is largely summarized rather than embodied; phrases like “watchfully calm” and “fortified vulnerability” are labels more than dramatized contradictions in action. Her “sensitivity to residual emotions” is stated but never forces a difficult choice or mistake, so there’s little real pressure on her competence. The arc is credible but safe, with minimal visible cost to the change.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chaplain’s guilt over the wrongly imprisoned man gives him a clear motive, but his inner conflict resolves too smoothly into a neat insight with little felt struggle. His emotional life is mostly summarized in abstractions (“weight on his conscience”) rather than being embodied in specific, pressured moments. The proprietor functions as a stock wise old man whose advice does not really test or complicate the chaplain’s stance. The final change in purpose feels plausible but under-earned for the scale of the stated failure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zephyr has a clear, consistent motivation (curiosity and the bell), but she lacks real internal contradiction or moments where competing impulses clash in scene. Her emotional life is mostly narrated in abstract terms (“irreverent awe”) rather than embodied, character-specific feeling. The final “change” is largely stated—she realizes she’s transcended her design—without a prior pattern of concrete, costly dilemmas to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lena’s core motive (solving the cold case as a displacement for her own grief) is clear and consistent, and the late recognition that she’s been “lying to herself” gestures toward real interior conflict. However, almost all of this is told in summary rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure, so we don’t feel her contradictions in scene. Her “transformation” at the end (“newfound sense of wonder and awe”) feels asserted more than earned by specific actions. The lack of other on-page characters also limits relational pressure that might expose more facets of her.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.0)
    The peacekeeper has a clear, consistent motivation and some interiority, but she experiences almost no real friction or contradiction; she moves serenely from perception to success. “To map empathy onto action” is an interesting driver, yet it’s mostly told rather than tested. Her competence is never meaningfully challenged, so we don’t see flaws or blind spots shaping choices. The final stance (quiet resolve) is earned but carries only a faint sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrator’s core situation and motive (failed euthanasia attempt, disorientation, tentative turn toward life) are clear and consistent, but the interiority often leans on generic phrasing (“I felt a sense of…”) rather than sharply particular contradictions. The choice to join the volunteers is under-pressured; it feels convenient rather than the outcome of a dramatized internal struggle. We’re told of despair and change more than we see that conflict enacted in specific micro-choices. The final fragile peace is plausible but not strongly earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentinel has a coherent role and sensibility, but her desires never sharpen beyond abstract guardianship and contemplation. Interiority stays generalized (“deep contentment,” “sense of belonging”) rather than sharply contradictory or particular. There is no real moment where conflicting impulses force a choice; she simply aligns with what the text has already told us she is. The result is a stable mood rather than an earned, costly shift in character.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The line walker has a clear surface motive (preserve the echo of wisdom) and some inner turmoil, but the conflict between turmoil and composure is mostly stated rather than dramatized in concrete, character-specific ways. Their “strangely honest” nature never forces a difficult, costly choice; they mostly cooperate serenely with the prophet’s purpose. Emotional shifts (turmoil → calm → confidence) feel smooth and under-tested, with little sense of real risk if they failed. The relationship with the prophet is reverential but thin, functioning more as ritual validation than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    Luna has a clear role and goal, but her psychology remains thin: we’re told she cares about “collective healing” and feels peace, yet we never see specific memories, contradictions, or costs that would individuate her. Her calm is generic rather than particularized in behavior under pressure. There is no true internal conflict or difficult choice; she simply does what she came to do. The “subtle puzzle archivist” label is never dramatized, which flattens what could have distinguished her.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scholar’s reticence, exhaustion, and obsessive focus on the “pattern of growth” are clear, and their unease at being summoned to testify gives them some interior tension. However, their inner life remains largely abstract; we’re told they feel a burden and turmoil, but we rarely see sharp, character-specific contradictions under pressure. The choice to go with the visitor is plausible but too unresisted for the weight the text claims it holds. The visitor is a flat functionary presence rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prophet’s core motive (to locate/capture the sound of growing older) is clear and consistent, and her actions (walking, arranging driftwood, discarding the chalk) align with it. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“tidal longing,” “deep, abiding peace”) rather than individuating detail or embodied contradiction. We see little real internal friction—no competing impulse to resist or redefine her quest—so the final acceptance feels gently asserted rather than hard-won. She reads as a mood-figure more than a fully realized person.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli has a clear occupation and stated motivation, but his interiority stays generic and mostly paraphrased (“felt a deep connection to the universe,” “luminous ache in his heart”) rather than embodied and particular. His shift from fascination with the clock hand to a broader realization about transcendence is conceptually coherent but arrives as a told epiphany rather than being earned through concrete, conflicted choices on the page. There is little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure; he simply does what the narration declares he must do. The result is functional but not yet psychologically rich enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena is clearly sketched as a devoted, gentle professional, and her motive to give Emma a “flawless goodbye” is consistent, but she lacks contradiction or real internal friction. Emma remains more a receptacle for care than an active character with her own complex interior. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final understanding between them feels earned enough, but without visible cost or ambiguity on Lena’s side.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s core motivation (understanding shadows/sealed awakenings) is clear and consistent, and her temperament as methodical scholar comes through. However, interiority stays generalized and expository—there’s little embodied emotion or contradictory impulse under pressure. She never faces a concrete dilemma that forces a visible trade-off, so we don’t see a hierarchy of values tested. The closing “sense of excitement and trepidation” reads as told rather than earned through specific, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s core disposition (forgiving skeptic, drawn to mystique) is clear, but it’s mostly asserted rather than dramatized in specific, pressured choices. Her internal change—from unsettled doubt to newfound purpose—tracks, yet emerges via summary-like realization instead of a concrete, costly decision on the page. The tension between nostalgia and innovation is interesting but rarely embodied beyond being named. Emotional texture skews generic (“sense of wonder,” “spark of curiosity”) rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The star watcher’s motive—sharing a gentle, fireless light—is clear and consistent, but largely uncontested and untested. Interiority stays in a single key of tranquil purpose without real contradiction or emotional layering. Micro-choices (to polish, to continue, to reflect) don’t force trade-offs or reveal deeper flaws. The final “change” is essentially a restatement of existing serenity rather than an earned shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aria’s core qualities—hurt, quietly proactive, seeking healing—are clear and consistent, and her gestures with the pendant and the flower align with them. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told she feels exposed and determined rather than seeing contradictory impulses clash in real time. The unnamed figure is purely functional and has no interiority or distinct presence beyond concern and kindness. The final shift toward “strength” and readiness feels a bit tidy and low-cost, undercutting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist’s conflict—paralysis versus the urge to write—is clear and consistent, but mostly stated rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. Her “change” (resolving to write again) arrives with little on-page struggle in the moment; the fear of failure is named, then simply yields to encouragement from the apparition. Interiority leans on generalized formulations (“she had always been drawn to the mysterious…”, “she knew that she had to continue writing”) rather than character-specific thought patterns or embodied contradiction. The woman in white functions more as a symbolic projection than as a crucible that forces difficult, value-testing decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s primary motivation—to remedy the villagers’ longing by restoring sacred practices—is clear and consistent, and her tinkerer role is credibly embedded. However, she faces virtually no resistance, and there is little internal conflict or contradiction in her desires or feelings. Emotional states are often summarized (“deep satisfaction,” “newfound sense of purpose”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final “change” is more the village’s mood shift than a hard-earned personal transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s motivation (to complete the enchantment and translate heartbeats into maps) is clear and consistent, and her outward patience is well established through repeated slow, ritualistic actions. However, there’s almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; her emotions stay on a single track of focused devotion with a brief, tidy “exhaustion and triumph” at the end. We don’t see her struggle with fear, doubt, or the cost of giving up her “own essence,” so the crucial act of sealing feels under-interrogated psychologically. The result is a competent but somewhat one-note characterization that doesn’t fully meet the piece’s lofty thematic ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s motivation (curiosity and the need to “store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is clear and consistent, but he experiences almost no real internal contradiction or pressure. His emotions are largely summarized rather than embodied and specific, so he feels more like a function of the premise than a fully individuated person. The “reflective locksmith” idea has potential, yet his locksmith identity rarely sharpens his choices beyond generic competence. The final sense of connection reads as an untested, cost-free evolution rather than an earned, pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.5)
    The weaver functions more as an archetypal priestess/artist than as a psychologically specific individual, with almost no contradiction or lived texture in her interiority. Her motivation—“to collect the weights of different burdens”—is stated but never really tested or strained. Micro-choices are mostly procedural (walk, enter, weave) rather than value-charged. The ending does not register as a costly change for her so much as a ritual completed.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    The widow’s grief and coping ritual are clear, but her interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“contain the pain,” “harvest lessons”) rather than sharply individuating detail. Her choices—to work, drink tea, endure the afternoon—track consistently with someone recently bereaved. There is little genuine contradiction or irrationality under pressure; the emotional progression feels smooth and tidy. The final “rust-hued peace” is earned enough for this scope but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scavenger’s core motivation—using found stories to negotiate with their own ghost—is clear and consistent, and the final act of taking the photograph credibly caps that drive. However, interiority is expressed in broad abstractions (“regret,” “eroded ambitions”) rather than character-specific perceptions or contradictory impulses in scene. We get almost no concrete, idiosyncratic physical reactions or micro-choices beyond walking, collecting, and clicking the shutter. The change toward “a measure of peace” feels plausible but largely asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s core traits (curious, hopeful, technically minded) are clear and consistent, and her decision to restore the terminal follows from them, but her interiority stays generic and largely unpressured. Emotions are often summarized (“a sense of wonder, a sense of awe”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular perception. There’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; she wants something, pursues it, and gets it without moral or emotional friction. Her final “change” into renewed hope feels asserted more than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elian’s temperament and abandoned dream are clearly established, and his quiet epiphany is motivated by the encounter with the bear. However, his interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“sense of peace,” “newfound sense of purpose”) rather than concrete, character-specific contradictions under pressure. We don’t see much genuine struggle between the safety of the tower and the risk of reclaiming his dream; the choice feels relatively easy. The emotional arc is coherent but not deeply particularized or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra’s core motivation and vocation are clear and consistent, but they remain mostly at the level of stated traits rather than dramatized contradictions. The final realization about having lied to herself gestures toward internal conflict, yet we haven’t seen specific prior self-deceptions in action, so the epiphany feels somewhat generic. Emotional texture is calm and reflective throughout, with little evidence of genuine struggle or degraded thinking under pressure. The arc works conceptually but doesn’t yet feel earned at a character-specific level.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    The collector’s motivation—to preserve ancient methods and decode the rope—reads clear and consistent, and her affinity for the sea is well grounded. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or genuine dilemma; her patience is a static asset rather than a trait under pressure. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in embodied, character-particular ways. The ending offers acceptance and satisfaction but without a visible cost or renunciation that would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator has a clear stated motivation (to understand “the geography of healing”) and a distinct occupation, but their emotional life is largely summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Aside from the decision to write, there are no real micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values. The late “sense of peace” feels more asserted than earned by on-page struggle. Character reads as consistent but somewhat generic and under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prince’s motivations (to restore beauty to a broken world despite despair) are clear and consistent, and his choice to build the device grows credibly from that. However, his interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“pang of sorrow,” “bitterly sweet nostalgia”) rather than character-specific perception. We see little contradiction or genuine flaw beyond weariness, so his emotional arc from hopelessness to wonder feels somewhat too smooth. The final tearful rebirth beat works, but it isn’t anchored in sharply individualized psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation—to heal rather than harm despite her lineage—is clear and consistent, and the firefighter/arsonist-daughter contrast is promising. However, her internal conflict is mostly stated rather than dramatized in specific, pressured choices. The scars/wise-woman insights arrive as tidy, unstruggled realizations. The final stance feels more like confirmation of an already-fixed identity than an earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s goal and temperament are clear, but she reads more as an archetypal seeker than a fully individuated person. Her “luminous skeptic” stance and “sidereal patience” are mostly labels rather than dramatized contradictions under pressure. We don’t see genuine internal conflict or a meaningful cost to becoming the guardian of the city’s memories. The emotional beats (excitement, trepidation, responsibility) are stated but not embodied in specific, character-particular ways.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The sentimentalist has a clear, consistent motivation—sharing cosmic understanding without destructive “fire”—but their inner life remains abstract and generalized. We don’t see contradictory impulses or concrete, pressured choices, only a steady, serene commitment. The gear and sonar method hint at specificity but never really expose flaws or blind spots. As a result, the final stance feels more declared than earned through dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.0)
    The carver’s grief, vocational focus, and attachment to her mentor are clear, but they remain largely told rather than dramatized through pressured choices. “Turmoil within” versus outward calm is asserted without many concrete, contradictory impulses in scene. Her final peace feels plausible but arrives via narration and setting rather than a sharply rendered internal struggle. Still, the vocation and family customs give her a specific, non-generic profile.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s guilt and desire for redemption are clear, but they’re rendered in generic terms (“the weight of her past actions,” “the harm she had caused”) without specific incidents or textured contradiction. Her shift from turmoil to determination feels smooth and untested, with little sense of competing impulses in the moment. The “ethically diligent” trait is mostly asserted rather than dramatized at cost. As a result, she reads more like an archetype of atonement than a fully individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    The gardener has a clear, consistent motive (understanding the echoes) and some occupational shading, but interiority is thin and mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. We rarely see contradictory impulses or real internal conflict; they simply and serenely keep working. The “change” at the end—new purpose—comes as a declarative realization more than an earned, costly shift. As a result the character feels more like a vessel for mood and concept than a fully inhabited person.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The cartographer’s motivation (breaking stagnation, “to seed innovation within the boundaries of the given”) is clearly stated but not truly dramatized under pressure. Interiority stays abstract and idealized; we never see contradictory impulses or meaningful doubt, just serene purpose. Micro-choices (retrieving the box, attaching the nib, letting models “unfold”) don’t reveal new facets of character. The ending “smiled, knowing that their work would prevail” feels unearned because no cost or struggle leads to that certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia has a clear, specific motivation (to capture the pirate broadcast and teach dust to tell stories), and her profession as a copyist is nicely woven into her actions at the desk. However, she experiences almost no internal contradiction or real moral/emotional cost; her “obsession” is told rather than dramatized under pressure. The implied presence behind her does not meaningfully alter her behavior or reveal new facets of her character. The ending reassurance and satisfaction feel untested, which keeps the arc from reaching deeper complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena’s role and sensibility are clear, and her profession is intriguingly specific, but her inner life remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or concrete micro-choices. Her shift—from worker executing a task to someone with “newfound appreciation”—is told more than earned via on-page struggle. Eli functions mostly as a mouthpiece for theme rather than a character exerting pressure on her. The ending change feels plausible but low-cost and underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael’s motives and worldview are clear—withdrawal from the “official story” and obsession with preserving ancient methods—but they are largely told rather than dramatized. His contradictions (rebellious yet reclusive, craving truth yet avoiding people) are present but not actively tested in scene. Aside from choosing to stay underground and dig, he doesn’t face a specific dilemma that forces a visible, costly choice. The final smile confirms his existing stance more than it reconfigures him.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia’s core motivation—to preserve harmony and unlearn hatred through music—is clear and consistent, and the zither/rosette reactions give her some specificity. However, she remains idealized and largely unconflicted; there’s little evidence of contradictory impulses or genuine moral ambiguity under pressure. Almost all of her interiority is thematic reflection rather than embodied struggle. The final “resolve to continue” feels credible but low-cost and not meaningfully different from her starting position.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s core traits—memory-tasting, reverent craft, desire to create beauty from decay—are clear and consistent, and her vocation is woven into her worldview. However, she faces no real dilemma or contradictory impulse, so we don’t see her forced to choose at a cost. Emotional texture stays largely at the conceptual level (“gentle rebellion,” “healing”) rather than embodied responses under pressure. The final “knowing” reads more as an authorial epiphany than a hard-won internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The toll keeper and the woman are sketched clearly but thinly; we know the keeper is candid and respected, and the woman is curious, but neither displays much internal contradiction or pressure-driven choice. The keeper’s “motivation” to preserve wonder is asserted rather than dramatized. Their decision to go up and investigate is consistent but almost frictionless. The emotional cost of their realization is gestured at, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli’s curiosity about “why some houses seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy” gives her a clear throughline, but her interiority remains generalized and low-friction. We’re told what she ponders more than we see embodied, contradictory feeling on the page. Her key choice—to perform the sanctifying ritual—is motivated but not tested, so there’s little sense of cost or internal conflict. The perfumer is a pleasant sketch rather than a pressure-bearing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    The statue has a clear nature (telepathic, “incisively kind”) and a loose motivation (to understand and then revitalize the garden), but it experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or difficult choice. Its shift from uncertainty to peace is told rather than earned through dramatized struggle. The parrotfish functions more as a mouthpiece for backstory than as a pressure on the statue’s desires. As a result, change feels conceptually asserted rather than psychologically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator’s obsession and “grim optimism” are clear and consistent, and the desire to solve perpetual motion via the dice provides a coherent through-line. However, internal conflict is mostly told rather than dramatized—there are few concrete micro-choices beyond “keep climbing and keep thinking.” The emotional register is fairly one-note, circling the same ideas without deepening contradiction or revealing new facets. The final stance (content to be bound) feels plausible but not strongly earned by specific prior trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.0)
    The painter’s core motivation—to revive lost languages and prove that kindness persists—is clear and consistent, and her decision to finally pick up the brush is reasonably earned. However, she experiences very little genuine internal conflict; the piece moves from mild longing to fulfilled purpose without contradictory impulses grinding against each other. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic ways. The “insomniac” trait and her flaws never meaningfully complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elena is sketched with clear traits (cultured, historically oriented, guardian of heritage), but her interiority stays generalized and largely summary-based. We rarely see contradictory impulses or a real micro-struggle—she “revels” in tales and “feels a sense of purpose,” but no cost or doubt complicates that. The group of visitors are faceless and exert no pressure on her stance. Her final commitment to be the city’s guardian is thematically aligned but emotionally under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The clock maker’s drive—curiosity and hunger for mystery—is clear and consistent, and his actions (entering, lifting the stone, solving the yoyo) align with it. However, his interiority leans on generalized excitement and “neatly inventive mind” rather than specific, character-particular thought. There is little real internal conflict: fear is briefly named but never complicates his choices. The final change (“never be the same”) is asserted more than earned through dramatized struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator’s basic motives (morbid curiosity, desire to “trick fear”) are clear and consistent, but the interiority stays generic rather than character-specific. Emotions often arrive as stock phrases (“creeping sense of dread,” “I shuddered at the thought”) instead of idiosyncratic reactions. The relationship with the whispering advisor has potential but never sharpens into a specific psychological dynamic beyond “temptation/urging.” The final change—being “forever marked”—is asserted more than dramatized through a textured inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prophet has a clear artistic motivation but almost no dramatized internal conflict or contradiction; she never struggles, doubts, or pays a price. Interiority is mostly implied through atmosphere rather than specific, idiosyncratic thought. Her emotional state stays in a single, serene register, so there’s no meaningful arc or earned endurance. This flattens what might otherwise be a vivid, particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s core motivation—curiosity about the lost expedition and the watchers—is clear and consistent, and her profession concretely informs her actions (reading shells, deciphering codes). However, her interior life is somewhat generic, with emotions often labeled (“unease,” “dread”) rather than rendered in idiosyncratic, embodied ways. There’s little sense of internal contradiction or genuine hesitation when she chooses to leave the city, so the final decision feels less costly than it could. The “quietly driven” trait is mostly asserted rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s motive—to uncover the truth behind a noble lie—is clear and consistent, but almost entirely summarized rather than dramatized. Her “emotionally rational” nature is told, not shown, and she encounters no real inner conflict or hesitation. Micro-choices under pressure are absent because the story never truly pressures her. The ending “triumph” feels costless, so change reads as confirmation of her starting position rather than growth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.0)
    The surveyor has a clear vocation and motivation, and their reverence for ruins/absence is consistent. However, interiority is largely told in generalized terms (“a sense of reverence washed over them,” “heart burned with a hushed blaze”) rather than embodied, character-particular feeling. There’s almost no internal contradiction or live struggle on the page; choices are serene and unpressured. The closing “smiled, knowing…” reads as an untested, tidy self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s core motivation—to trace honest origins—is clear and consistent, and her cryptographic competence reads plausibly. However, emotional texture stays generalized (“sense of excitement,” “sense of pride”) rather than deeply embodied or contradictory, so she feels more like a function than a fully particular person. Internal conflict is minimal: doubts about the cipher resolve quickly into confidence without real friction or cost. Her change at the end (new purpose, hope) is more told than earned through pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kaito’s grief, longing for the basilica, and dedication to craft are clear and consistent, and his motivation to transform sorrow into objects gives him a legible inner drive. However, his emotions are often summarized in abstract terms (“luminous torment,” “aching longing”) rather than grounded in concrete, contradictory impulses in scene. The key actions—releasing the crane and returning to work—imply a subtle shift, but the cost and internal conflict around those choices are under-dramatized. He feels more like an archetypal mourner-artisan than a sharply individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Amira’s core motivation (escape trauma, then find the source of the destruction) is clear, but her emotional journey feels rushed from devastation to almost mission-statement purpose. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“unfiltered awakening,” “unused potential”) rather than specific, embodied contradictions under stress. Her choices mainly advance exposition (going to the observatory, deciding to “hunt”) rather than revealing complex flaws or blind spots. The closure beat asserts a tempered, resilient self but doesn’t fully earn that shift through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena’s goal (decode the “frequency of belonging”) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a pilot/decoder is evident, but her inner life stays generic. The late epiphany about belonging feels more told than earned, with little on-page struggle or contradiction leading up to it. Emotions are summarized (“excitement,” “trepidation,” “sense of belonging”) rather than embodied in idiosyncratic reactions. Her final sense of arrival in herself lands, but without visible cost or a prior, dramatized flaw it reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s guilt and unease are clear and consistent, and her profession gives her an inherently rich internal contradiction (truth-seeker who manufactures lies). However, most of this is told rather than dramatized, and her key “choices” (take a walk, return to client) feel low-pressure and somewhat generic. We rarely see her hypocrisy or conflict bite in a concrete, character-specific way beyond generalized dread. The final resolve to “uncover the truth, no matter the cost” isn’t fully earned by prior, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.5)
    The negotiator has a clear, consistent motivation (facilitate the exchange and transform resentment into wisdom), but her interiority remains generalized and almost entirely composed of calm resolve. We rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine strain; there is no moment where she is visibly tempted to give up, lash out, or compromise her values. Her actions—holding the drawer pull, speaking to the parties—are aligned but low-cost. The result is functional but emotionally muted characterization rather than a fully realized, pressured person.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    Jack’s motivation (recovering from divorce and regret) is clear, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract labels (“backlash of regrets,” “sense of purpose”) rather than concrete, character-specific thought or behavior. His shift from lost to hopeful feels under-struggled, with little sense of competing impulses live on the page. The “merrily melancholic” descriptor is asserted rather than embodied, so he reads more like an archetype than an individual.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena’s role as a “clean slate seeker” with a stubbornly clinging past is conceptually strong, and her pull toward the lake and the ball is at least minimally motivated. However, her interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“felt an inexplicable connection,” “weight of her past”) rather than character-specific contradiction or embodied conflict. The piece tells us she’s jaded and driven to kindle empathy, but we rarely see that tension dramatized in micro-choices beyond “she walks further.” The closing stance shift (past lifting, purpose coalescing) is believable but under-earned because she has not faced a concrete, resisting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra’s role as caretaker and conduit is clear, and her decision to help Aria is motivated, but her “reluctant metamorphosis” is mostly declared rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Aria’s grief and determination are summarized rather than embodied, so her emotional presence is thinner. The relationship between the two women never quite becomes a crucible; Lyra aids Aria without serious friction or moral dilemma. The final sense of Lyra’s “expansion” is conceptually neat but not deeply earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cartomancer’s longing and confusion are clear, and the link to her child and lost time gives her some dimensionality. However, her interiority stays mostly in one register of wistful rumination, with little sense of contradictory impulses active at once. Her final “acceptance” of cloudbound repentance feels more declared than earned by specific, pressured micro-choices. The character reads as a strong sketch rather than a fully stressed, individuated psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aurora’s core motivation (unlocking the locked dimension through shadow work) is clear and consistent, and the pacifist/compassionate stance aligns with her actions. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“deep sense of resolve,” “ghostly resolve”) rather than specific, character-particular contradictions. The “perilous” nature of the shadow work is mostly told, not dramatized through concrete missteps or psychic costs. As a result, her final transcendence feels more preordained than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aria’s motives (drawn to the unusual, sensitive to “nudges”) are mostly told rather than dramatized, and her shift from skepticism to cosmic understanding happens with little on-page struggle. The “destitute philanthropist” label never meaningfully informs her decisions. Her emotional life is summarized in generic language (“felt a sense of peace,” “surge of gratitude”) instead of specific, embodied contradiction. The old woman is purely functional and exerts almost no real pressure on Aria’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    The sentinel has a clear role and throughline—guardian who becomes revolutionary—but reads more as an emblem than a fully inhabited person. Motivation is stated (“spark a silent revolution”) rather than deepened through contradictory impulses or embodied doubt. Her competence (decoding, activating mechanisms) faces no real friction, so we see little of her under pressure. The relationship with the conspirator remains generic, offering no real crucible for character.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.5)
    The herder has a clear function (fulfill an ancestral promise by unlocking cosmic patterns), but little interior contradiction or textured emotion. The “precognitively cursed” trait never meaningfully complicates choices or creates visible cost. The completion at the end reads as smooth fulfillment rather than a hard-won or ambivalent change. Overall, the character feels archetypal more than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s interiority is present and consistent—she wants to understand her “cartography of scars”—but it’s rendered in fairly abstract, generalized terms. Her change (from turmoil to peace) is declared more than dramatized through conflicting impulses or concrete micro-choices. The “censored” aspect of her identity never meaningfully constrains or complicates what she does on the page. Overall she reads as a type (tormented, self-reflective artist) more than as a sharply individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aurélien has a clear role and a few distinctive traits (mechanical arm, philosopher-duelist, fixation on tools), but his inner conflict is thin and largely summarized rather than dramatized. His motivation to “turn questions into destinations” is stated but never forces a painful or complex choice. Emotional states are mostly implied through posture and summary (calmed, focused, victorious) rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final “realization” about the journey over victory feels generic and not especially earned by specific earlier micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    The poet’s motivation (hope, art-as-resistance, friendship) is clear and consistent, and their decision to rebuild the library grows plausibly from their history. However, internal conflict is muted: we’re told of “molting personalities” and a mix of “curiosity and defiance,” but these contradictions rarely force difficult, on-page choices. Emotions skew summarized and generalized rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The closing sense of renewed purpose is earned but comes without much visible cost or moral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The pianist’s grief and desire for refuge are clear and consistent, and her choices (entering the film world, returning, playing the encore) track with those motives. However, her inner life remains generalized—“lost love,” “pain of her past”—without concrete, particularizing detail. Internal contradiction (wanting to stay in refuge vs. knowing she must leave) is stated rather than deeply dramatized. The final stance shift toward “steely longing” is plausible but somewhat epiphanic in feel.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation and doubt are clear, but her interiority leans on generalized language (“a surge of determination,” “luminous doubt”) rather than specific, character-particular thought and embodiment. Her “empirically whimsical” nature is told, not shown through distinctive choices. The internal conflict—am I preserving or distorting?—never forces a concrete, costly decision; she simply continues her work. The final shift from doubt to conviction feels more asserted than earned by dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kaito’s core motivation (processing regret after a painful separation) is clear and his actions—picking up the compass, performing the lace ritual, releasing the object—track consistently. However, his interiority leans abstract and generic (“weight of regret,” “sense of peace”) rather than character-particular, and we rarely see genuine contradiction or messy ambivalence in the moment. The emotional shift from burdened to peaceful occurs smoothly and predictably, with limited felt cost or resistance. His identity as a bonsai tutor is largely decorative until the closing return to the garden, where it echoes his newfound calm but doesn’t complicate his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.5)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or distinct voice. Her emotions are labeled ("quiet reverence," "kindled humility") rather than embodied, and she faces no micro-choices or pressure that would reveal character. She functions solely as a passive observer to deliver the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation to transform grief is consistent and embodied in crafting lanterns and cranes, with contradictory solace/torment impulses shown through actions like rising at sunset. Final endurance of creating amid loss feels earned via prior micro-choices. Minor weakness: interiority veers toward poetic abstraction over fully particular flaws in pivotal release moment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Amira's motivation to hunt unused potential intensifies credibly from trauma, but interiority relies on repetitive diagnostic phrases like "unfiltered awakening" without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Dr. Patel applies minimal pressure as expositor. Final purpose feels earned but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sparse interiority with stock phrasing like "sense of calm determination"; no contradictory impulses or flaws complicating on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent motivation to realign drives paddling choice with embodied calm, but repetitive diagnostic labels like "backlash of regrets" weaken contradictory impulses in pivotal reflection beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.1)
    No contradictory impulses act in scene; interiority relies on abstract labels like "jaded wonder" without embodied micro-choices; unearned epiphany at box find flattens motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strength in Lyra's embodied reluctance during ritual ("shiver run down her spine," "exhilarating and terrifying") and steady core amid merge; motivation clear but lacks micro-choices under pressure showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Aria applies secondary pressure effectively. Final endurance earned by prior gift and decision to help.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    Abstract interiority dominates with stock phrasing like "sense of nostalgia" and "sense of peace," lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices under pressure; motivation feels told via reflection rather than embodied struggle, yielding unearned acceptance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pacifism is consistent but ornamental, with no contradictory impulses tested under pressure; interiority concrete in stitching but lapses into label-speak like "shadow work" without embodied crisis depth, diluting closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.9)
    Aria's traits (drawn to unusual, sensitive to nudges) are told repeatedly via backstory summaries like "She had always been drawn," flattening interiority into stock phrasing without contradictory impulses acting in scene. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; change to acceptance feels unearned. Old woman's prophetic delivery applies no crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.7)
    Sentinel's motivation shifts abruptly to revolution without contradictory impulses or embodied tension; "calmly inventive mind quickly grasped" is label-only, lacking micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under guard duty pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation clear but procedural without contradictory impulses or embodied stress; rock placement lacks micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under curse pressure. Interiority tells reverence via stock phrasing like "sense of reverence and wonder" rather than particular contradiction. Earned change feels declarative, not pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.3)
    Abstract interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "storm-kissed wonder" and unembodied epiphanies, e.g., "sense of understanding wash over her," diluting contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mechanical arm's precision in the duel climax effectively embodies skill under pressure; motivation to turn questions into destinations drives interiority but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding competent but unlayered traits.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.3)
    Generic interior summaries dominate without contradictory impulses acting in the rebuild decision; molting trait labelled but unconstrained.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation rooted in lost love intensifies through refuge-seeking choices, embodied in fingers on keys and heart beating faster during film entry; meaningful endurance earned as she returns changed.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.1)
    Maria’s interiority is largely abstract—“pondered,” “realized,” “come to realize”—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice is visibly costly. The neutron-star backstory is told, not dramatized, so the leave-of-absence motive never tests her in scene. No relationship crucible or secondary pressure exists; the story is a monologue of summary. Closure is soft epiphany without a renunciation or path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but stays abstract; no embodied contradiction. “She felt a surge of curiosity” is diagnostic label-speak. The ledger-triggered shift to “guardian / seeker” is declared, not dramatized; cost is soft. Steadily adaptive is only asserted, never tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Survivor’s trauma is sketched in labels (“frazzled nerves”) rather than embodied contradiction; her creative drive is declared, not tested under pressure. Eli’s silently-expressive trait is shown once in the nod, then dropped; no visible trade-off or cost attached to either character. The partnership forms without status friction or micro-choice that forecloses a path; interiority stays safe and therapeutic.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The undertaker’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is named but never dramatized in a costly choice; his interiority drifts toward abstract yearning (“give rest a permanent address”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final serenity feels declared rather than earned by a visible renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.7)
    Akira’s “gentle determination” is asserted, not embodied; her single micro-choice—ringing the bell—does not cost her anything or foreclose a path. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the interior is flat. The community’s gratitude is collective scenery; no individual relationship tests her.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s curiosity and past-life ache are named but never embodied in risky micro-choices; the pilgrim does the breathing work for her. Interiority drifts into soft-focus “sense of peace” and “longing” rather than contradiction under pressure. The camera obscura remains a label—no shot is framed, no failed exposure wrestled with—so the artist identity stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elian’s curiosity and trepidation are shown through bodily reaction, but the interior contradiction (“exhilarating yet terrifying”) is summarized, not dramatized. No micro-choice under pressure is visible; the fragment is simply touched and visions happen to him. The retrocognitive trap is declared rather than enacted, so the cost feels abstract. The final resolve to “weave its secrets into their next maze” is a poised plan, not an earned renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority stays at emblem level—“a symbol of freedom and chaos,” “heart swelled with purpose”—without embodied contradiction or degrading perception under stress. Micro-choices (decoding keys, distributing seeds) are present but lack visible trade-offs or stakes-based cost; the liberator never risks failure or moral compromise. Chains and “strategic mind” are asserted, not dramatized; no blind spot or error compounds. Endurance/renunciation is gestured toward but not foreclosed with on-page price, so the arc feels illustrative rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s synesthetic grief is embodied early via color-whispers and the golden-mother memory; the interior contradiction—comfort in silence yet quest to bottle its shatter—drives every micro-choice at the bench. The climax (imprinting the crystalline break-sound) is motivated by this same wound, so the renunciation of complete closure feels earned. Still, the absence of a second on-page character keeps status/relationship pressure offstage, limiting crucible heat to an internal forge. Voice remains coherent and specific, but the diagnostic self-awareness “she sought to understand through her craft” nudges toward therapy-speak mid-arc, keeping it under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.9)
    Lumina’s interiority is lyrically sketched but abstract—“luminous disbelief,” “insatiable curiosity”—rather than embodied in concrete contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a value hierarchy; the camera click is automatic, not a costly decision. The arc is static: observation → confirmation of destiny’s whisper, with no visible flaw or price paid. Competence is balanced, but genuine struggle is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority is present but abstract; Elian’s thawing heart is told (“a metaphor for the world’s gradual awakening”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Micro-choices are limited to the glass-making ritual; no visible cost or path-foreclosing decision occurs. The bookmark is mentioned once and dropped, offering no pressure. Character remains functional but archetypal rather than individual under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is earnest but slips into diagnostic talk (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive”) that tells rather than dramatizes fear; the stunt-double identity is asserted, never tested in scene. The contradiction between daredevil job and secret terror is potent yet remains abstract—no single embodied beat shows trembling hands mid-stunt or a memory of almost-failure. The final stance-shift (“vulnerability is power”) is declared, not earned through a visible cost or irreversible choice; we never see the protagonist abandon a safety behavior or confess to anyone. Voice is consistent, but emotional progression is linear and tidy, missing the irrational hypocrisy that could complicate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Oracle’s interiority is lyrically specific—“mildly obsessed with the art of listening to the silence”—but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the retelling/summarizing action is a single steady state rather than a pressured choice, so the final smile feels bestowed by the text, not earned by causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    Zeta’s interiority is largely abstract—“curiosity about the source of its own thoughts”—and never manifests as a concrete, embodied contradiction on the page; the loops are summarized, not dramatized. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the “realization” is declarative, not earned through visible cost. The ice violin is observed but never handled or risked by Zeta, so the object cannot serve as a crucible. The trait “remarkably composed” is stated repeatedly but never tested or subverted, keeping the character static rather than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is atmospheric but generic; the registrar’s “pondering the weight of honesty” is told, not embodied. No contradictory impulses play out in scene—she simply walks, looks, and feels resolve. The lens and tickets are handled, yet never force a micro-choice that costs her anything. Closure is a declared freedom, not one paid for by dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dresser’s devotion is palpable, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“wisely pragmatic” vs. nostalgic ritual) rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice; the polishing ritual never risks failure or tangible trade-off, so the final smile feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelin’s obliging nature is asserted rather than embodied—she never weighs refusal or cost. The interior contradiction promised by “mechanically warm” is summarized, not dramatized; the sideways-time belief drives the plot but is stated three times before it is tested. Touching the nexus is the sole micro-choice, and it carries no visible trade-off or hesitation. Closure gives her awe but no renunciation or new constraint, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rachel’s interiority is vivid (“music seemed to seep from the very walls”), but her motivation to crack the code is stated rather than dramatized with contradiction or cost; the pivotal decision to tilt the program is the only micro-choice that actually changes her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aria’s “fault-tolerant” nature is shown, not labeled: she tolerates ambiguity by physically re-writing the logbook, a micro-choice that costs her standing with the staff. The swallowed-truth motive stays live—every smudge is a probe whose price is social friction. Interiority stays concrete (“shoulders ease,” “fever fog”) and degrades under noetic strain. The ending renunciation—leaving with only a “smudged” memory—pays the cost, earning stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is atmospheric but generically “explorer-curious”; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The beaded wheel is fingered, yet never alters tactics or stakes; same for the logbook. Religious skepticism is declared, never pressure-tested. Closure is a feeling of clarity without a visible forfeiture—cost is asserted, not embodied—so the change feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper’s detachment is atmospherically rendered but never crystallizes into a concrete, costly choice; the burrowing is passive, not a micro-choice that pits contradictory impulses against one another under rising pressure. Interiority circles the same abstract note (“witness without judgment”) without embodied contradiction or stakes-driven escalation. No visible flaw complicates the stance, so the final stillness feels preordained rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s interiority is present but leans on “ordinary magic” clichés; the curl stays ornamental, never traded or risked, so the closure lacks embodied cost. Eli’s wonder is observed, not filtered through micro-choices that could force Aria to renounce or pay anything. The result feels therapeutic rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Emilia’s “odd historian” label is shown more than told—her fingers “itch to probe,” she spends “years collecting,” and her method is “painstaking.” Interiority is concrete (“bronze quiet” inside her) and embodied. Yet the only micro-choice on-page is to lift and store the tapestry fragment; the diaries are read, not used to alter tactics. No contradictory impulse or visible cost forecloses a path; the closure is a quiet smile, not an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.2)
    Oracle is a label, not a person. No contradictory impulses, no micro-choice under pressure, no embodied emotion—just abstract self-mythologizing. The stranger is a silent prop; status flatlines. Closure line restates premise without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The priest’s interiority is mostly abstract—“he had been drawn,” “his desire to illuminate”—so we witness labeled intention rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. Concrete micro-choices are scarce; the ritual’s operation is summarized, not dramatized beat-by-beat. The ending smile and “heart still full” are performed emotion, not embodied cost. What saves the score is the single-minded vocation that stays consistent and the implied renunciation of spectacle, creating a thin earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The writer’s longing is lyrically evoked but never crystallizes into a concrete, high-stakes choice; the map-tracing is the only micro-action and it carries no visible trade-off or contradiction, so the “conductor” desire remains abstract. No interior contradiction or embodied cost is dramatized; the nautilus pulses but does not force a decision that reveals hierarchy of values. The ending’s resolve is declared, not earned through a prior on-page sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is evocative—"periodically eternal existence" gives a concrete ache—but contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized in a moment where two wants rip her in opposite directions. The tablet is handled repeatedly, yet every choice is a calm, solitary computational step rather than a micro-choice that visibly forfeits something. The closing stance is strong, but the cost is atmospheric ("darkness coalescing") rather than a specific, earlier-laid price. Voice remains consistent and otherworldly; still, the absence of embodied tension under pressure keeps her just shy of lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s deafness and emotional numbness are stated, not embodied; her only micro-choice is stroking a drum while humming. No contradictory impulse or visible cost appears, so the “earned” hush feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    The storm recorder’s meticulousness is asserted repeatedly but only once translates into an observable micro-choice (decoding the note). Interiority drifts into diagnostic summary (“credibly curious nature got the better of her”) rather than embodied contradiction. No visible cost or error flows from her trait; she exits the scene exactly as she entered, only more resolved. The absence of a mistake or forfeiture keeps the arc just shy of “earned.”

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lush—her olfactory memories are concrete and character-specific—yet her arc is almost entirely internal, lacking micro-choices that visibly foreclose options. The single decision (returning the emptied vial) is quiet but not driven by a prior causal dilemma on the page. Aromatic caution is shown in perception, not in a beat where it costs her anything. The grief is embodied, yet no contradictory impulse complicates it; the emotion is performed rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s desire to “feel the texture of time” is lyrically stated but never dramatized as a concrete, high-stakes want; she patterns stones and walks away with the same inscrutable smile, so no contradiction or cost is embodied. Interiority is atmospheric (“insatiable hunger,” “passionate subtlety”) rather than specific, embodied thought. Because no choice narrows or forecloses a path, the arc lands as observation, not character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The violinist’s want—“a glimmer of hope” and “beauty in the unfinished”—is declared, never dramatized through contradiction or forfeiture; her single micro-choice (playing) merely enacts the premise rather than testing it. Interiority floats in lyrical labels (“raw and honest”) instead of embodied, time-bound thought, so the change feels symbolically bestowed, not earned. Because the bowl is the only tangible extension of her motive, and she never risks or relinquishes anything for it, the arc lands as soft-focus tableau, not crucible. No cost is legible on the page, so Earned Stasis/Charged Poise criteria are unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority is present but abstract—“subsume her own emotions” is told, not embodied. No micro-choice shows the cost of that suppression; the dealer remains a poised observer. The blotter petal is sensed, yet the moment never perturbs her calm, so contradiction is asserted, not dramatized. Closure is a serene exit, not an earned renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lena’s shrewdness is asserted but never shown pressuring a decision; the locket find is accidental, not driven by broker cunning. Interiority drifts into generic warmth (“felt a desire to initiate a gesture”) rather than concrete tactical thought. The final commitment to launch the project is told, not dramatized with visible trade-off, so the arc feels soft rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s longing to belong is vivid and embodied, but the arc is narrated rather than dramatized; the decisive moment of acceptance is summarized in a communal hug rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs something on the page. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“luminescent ache”) instead of sensory contradiction under pressure. The flaw never complicates the outcome—once the tag is found, belonging is unconditionally granted—so the turn feels smoothed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; the “insatiable drive” is declared, not dramatized. She never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the spell succeeds without friction or contradiction. The pendant’s glow and sketchbook fill themselves—external magic substitutes for internal change. Earned stasis is hinted at in the final smile, but the cost is off-stage, keeping her arc shallow for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conjurer’s “deep-seated desire to understand the mathematics of emotion” is declared, not dramatized; interiority stays abstract (“felt a spark of understanding”) and the glass eyes do more emotional work than she does. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-ritual, so the final “enigmatic smile” feels unearned. Micro-choices are limited to finger-weaving and kneeling—gestural poverty that keeps pressure external. Still, the solitary POV is coherent and the character’s flaw (intellectualizing grief) is legible, holding the piece above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dweller’s gentle compulsion to “become visible” is consistent, but interiority stays generic; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The memory flash is vivid yet passive—no micro-choice alters present tactics. Closure is a soft glow rather than a renunciation with felt cost, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority drifts into therapeutic self-diagnosis ("her circuitously sincere nature...holding her back") that sounds like workshop language rather than lived thought. Emotions are named, not embodied—no sweat, breath, or tremor accompanies the supposed metamorphosis. The single micro-choice—deciding to "immerse herself"—is reported, not dramatized; we never see her actually release control in a moment that costs her. Because the climax is summarized, the felt price of change is off-stage, so the arc feels observational rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The painter’s insomnia is stated, not embodied; no late-night bodily cost or hallucination sharpens the obsession. The “wryly earnest” tag is repeated but never dramatized in a choice that costs him anything. The final decision to embed the brooch in the artwork is logical but feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled out of contradictory impulses; we see no moment where he almost destroys or sells it. Interiority stays safely therapeutic (“process the trauma”) instead of fracturing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aria’s interiority is pleasingly concrete—her “curiosity was piqued” is shown through the physical act of retreating deeper into the cave—but she never faces a genuine contradiction in scene; the pilgrim’s gift simply awakens new powers without testing or costing her anything she wants. The “steadily unpredictable” energy of the pearl is reported, not exploited to force a micro-choice that reveals flaw or value hierarchy. Closure is a serene epiphany rather than an earned renunciation; we are told she now “stood as a beacon,” but the sacrifice or risk that posture demands remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    Archivist’s desire to “compile fragments” is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a single high-stakes choice; the interiority stays at thematic label level (“sense of absence,” “overwhelming urge”) and the final smile feels unearned because no concrete micro-choice on the page actually costs her anything.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.7)
    Emilia’s “analytically artistic” label is only ornamental; no moment shows the trait altering a choice or exacting a price. Interiority is stock-lyric (“trembling certainty”) rather than embodied contradiction. The phantom punch is picked up and glows, but this never narrows or complicates her tactics—she simply keeps walking. Closure is an unearned epiphany: knowledge floods in without a visible cost or micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Emilia’s skeptical curiosity is stated repeatedly but never weaponized; she never doubts aloud or tests the tile, so the “skeptic” half stays ornamental. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“felt an unexpected surge of courageously kind determination”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses. The final ascent carries a quiet renunciation, but the cost is generalized (“sense of peace”) rather than embodied or priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kael’s immortal ennui is stated but never embodied in contradiction or visible cost; the “spark of intrigue” is declared, not dramatized. The duplicate-Kael encounter should force a micro-choice that hurts, yet Kael simply mirrors the gesture and absorbs abstract wisdom. No interior contradiction plays out in scene; the story tells us curiosity reignites rather than showing a visceral, costly shift. The closure image is pretty but emotionally flat because no prior flaw or hunger is put at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete—"ink pot seemed to liquefy the rigid thinking"—but the decision to breach protocol is announced, not dramatized in-scene. Father–daughter status shift is only reported, so the cost of her readiness is inferred, not embodied. Contradictory impulses appear in reflection, yet final assent lacks a visible micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stationer’s collector-obsession is vivid early (“sparkled with intensity”), but her interiority never complicates or contradicts itself; the same beat—sketching hums—repeats without higher-stakes trade-offs. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the “earned stasis” closure feels more like a pause than a cost. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli, yet remains descriptive rather than decision-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.1)
    The survivor’s motivation—layering fragments to feel the texture of erased memories—remains an abstract wish; no concrete contradiction or micro-choice under pressure dramatizes why this matters now. Interiority loops the same paraphrase (“texture of memories,” “nameless identity”) without embodied emotion or visible cost. Because the closing stillness is not foreclosed by any prior decision that hurts, the arc feels observational rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority is poetic but abstract; emotions are named (“gloomy cheerfulness”) rather than felt. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply keeps listening and retelling. The seashell and cello beats repeat the same register without escalating internal stakes. No visible cost or renunciation is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ava’s “culture-shock absorber” premise is vivid, but interiority stays at role level; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her choices. The chip moment is the sole embodied beat; elsewhere emotion is narrated rather than shown through body or decision. The climactic stance is credible, yet the cost feels communal, not personal—her own stake never tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s “purposefully curious” label is repeated but never tested against a contradicting impulse; she never hesitates or refrains. No interior contradiction under pressure, so the trait feels decorative. The emotional beat at the sight of the flora is summarized (“eyes stung with unshed tears”) rather than embodied. Earned stasis is present but the cost is generic, not tied to a specific character flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emilia’s blind-savant calibration feels lived-in, not magical; the unwavering serenity borders on saintly and flattens the internal contradiction meter. No visible cost or error undercuts her competence, so the arc is static grace rather than earned struggle. Still, the embodied detail of touch-guided work keeps her from slipping into trope.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.1)
    Emilia’s obsession with the convergence is declared early but never collides with an opposing force that forces her to test or betray that desire; her interiority stays in lyric register (“turmoil that churned beneath her surface”) without contradictory impulse enacted in scene. The only micro-choice—stepping onto the lake—restates, rather than complicates, her opening goal. No visible cost or foreclosed path arrives with the final image, so the arc is circular, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tuner is a watchful silhouette, never granted interior contradiction or embodied emotion; “infinitely patient” is asserted, not dramatized. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values, so the final “resumption of work” carries no felt cost. The piece is voice-driven, not character-driven; that can work, but here the absence of any visible flaw or struggle keeps the figure ornamental rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s lonely resolve is palpable, but interiority drifts into lyric perfume-speak (“touching memories”) that abstracts rather than embodies. The contradiction between clinging to life and overriding instinct is named, not dramatized—no moment shows her body fighting itself. Final “smile in darkness” gestures toward Earned Stasis yet feels declared; the cost of overriding instinct is only summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The son’s curiosity is credibly seeded, but interiority leans on inherited “weight of legacy” shorthand rather than a private, body-level itch. No forked desire shows in-scene; he drifts through awe without contradictory impulse. Final touch of the lock is thinly motivated—no visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ghost bride’s debt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains atmospheric rather than embodied; the alchemist’s shift from curiosity to mastery is declared, not dramatized via micro-choice. The absence of visible cost or contradiction flattens the arc to a gentle slope instead of a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s interiority is lyric but thin: “hauntingly optimistic vision” and “pang of longing” stay abstract. The only embodied beat is needle-dancing; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. Endurance is declared, not costed—no forfeiture or tool loss shown. She reads as a spiritual archetype rather than an individual whose flaws shape the weave.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.3)
    Maya’s interiority drifts into workshop-speak (“seeking to rebuild a connection,” “sense of responsibility to honor their memory”) instead of embodied contradiction; no moment shows her wanting to quit yet staying. The sundial is finger-traced three times with identical emotional summary, flattening hierarchy of values. Faith-restoration motive is declared repeatedly but never collides with a counter-desire on the page; thus the final “cautious enchantment” feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.9)
    Only one interior contradiction points (“lost in the flow of cryptography and creativity” vs. absorbed craftsmanship) but no embodied emotion or micro-choice under pressure; the character is a label cluster, never forced to trade one want against another. Motivation is ornamental; “discover meaning in the margins” is repeated, not dramatized. Closure image offers no visible cost or stance shift, so the portrait stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    The embroiderer’s interior contradiction—witty mask vs. urgent sleuth—stays abstract; no embodied emotion or micro-choice under needle pressure shows the disguise costing them anything. “Pondering whispers” and “mind racing” are summary, not dramatized conflict; the promised flaw never alters a visible decision, so the final smile feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aria’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays observational; she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The “moment before deciding” is contemplated, not enacted, so the promised change is only asserted. Healing skin and shard remain symbolic—never once does moonlight’s pain or the relic’s edge alter her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interiority is evocative—translator-as-decoder mirrored in reading the cast—but contradictions stay summary-level (“lotus-hearted ache” repeated without fresh embodiment). The moment she decrypts the cast is decisive and stakes her own trauma, earning the late softening, yet we never see her mistranslate or misstep on-page, so competence feels protected rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s desire to “rediscover the lost joy” is stated early and drives every beat; her micro-choice to unearth the fragment, then to paint with the exposed film, is visibly embodied and costs her abandoned project. Interiority stays concrete—“the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a morbid perfume” anchors emotion without label-speak. The only flaw is a slight therapeutic overtone in “she had been feeling lost and uninspired,” but it is immediately grounded in action. Closure renunciation—leaving the mural to the fog—carries earned, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s interiority is evocative (“itch to bewitch the very fabric of reality”) and embodied emotion surfaces, but micro-choices remain broad gestures rather than concrete trade-offs. The hobo nickel warms/pulses but never forces a visible decision cost under pressure. Contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final shift to curiosity reads as declarative rather than paid for by prior mistakes or losses.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra’s “charming rogue scholar” label is never contradicted by on-page action: we watch her garden, not steal, barter, or charm. Interiority stays generic (“spark of defiance” repeated) and emotion is declared, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; choices are smooth gardening tasks, so motivation feels flat. The ending offers no cost or renunciation tied to her character—just a satisfied smile—so the arc feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “shyly unstoppable” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a visible contradiction; the centuries-long span is summarized rather than embodied, so interiority feels generic. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are N/A. The final lullaby is a micro-choice, but its cost is only asserted (“weight…lift”), not dramatized, keeping the arc in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The caretaker’s motive to “preserve the sound of forgotten names” is stated repeatedly but never tested; she sings, orchids glow, and the moment ends without a visible cost or trade-off. Interiority stays atmospheric (“foxglove regret”) rather than contradictory under pressure. No micro-choice forecloses a path; the action is circular maintenance, not escalation. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive to redeem a past scholarly error is vivid, but the interiority slips into abstract self-diagnosis (“deep-seated need to restore trust”) rather than embodied contradiction. The glass ink well moments give micro-choices physicality; still, no scene shows peers actually doubting her, so the relational crucible is off-stage. Earned stasis is credible—she endures isolation and finishes the transcription—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized on anyone else’s face. Voice remains consistent; indigo eyes/quill rituals individuate her without cliché overload.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelin’s interiority is warm and embodied (“slyly heartfelt warmth spread through her chest”), but the contradictory impulses demanded by the 9+ test are only summarized, not dramatized in a single beat. Her micro-choices—unwinding the chain, studying adhesive—are repetitive and low-stakes; none narrows options or forces a trade-off. The purported internal conflict (heritage vs. safety) is declared, never tested on the page, so the final “resolve” feels unearned. No visible cost or foreclosed path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is atmospheric—dust-mote meditation, paper-trail shame—but motives remain abstract ("preserve the echo of lost songs" as theme label, not actionable desire). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the single micro-choice (send last pigeon) changes nothing. Earned cost is gestural: “peace settling over her” tells the renunciation without embodying forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority drifts into lyrical self-summary (“featherly determined,” “sense of kinship”) without embodied contradiction under pressure; the father’s absence until the closing beat keeps relationship crucible off-page, so change lands as greeting-card recognition rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The astrologer’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; motives stay at “seeking respite” rather than concrete stakes. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the only micro-choice—lifting the feather—feels symbolic, not tactical. The closing “quiet satisfaction” is declared, not embodied, so the renunciation cost is inferred rather than felt on the page. Still, the POV remains consistent and the professional lens (landscape astrologer) does color perception, keeping the score mid-strong.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The recollectionist’s interior contradiction—joy in the hunt while “cheerful gloom” deepens—lands as performed label-speak rather than embodied tension. Her micro-choice to transliterate feeling into hum is vivid, yet the hum never alters tactics or costs her anything; it’s decorative. Memory-as-stake stays abstract; no visible flaw complicates the search, so the arc feels safe. The crater glass glows but never constrains her next step—an opportunity for tactile cost missed.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s interiority is mostly “performer at work” reverie—no clashing impulses, no risk, no body in jeopardy. The bishop piece could have forced a micro-choice (drop it, palm it, lose it) but remains a passive talisman; therefore the arc is a smooth plateau, not a crucible. Reflection blocks sit at ~25 % yet merely re-state his creed rather than tilt present tactics. Earned stasis is hinted but the cost is verbal, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s interiority is sensuously embodied (“bare feet curled,” “breathing slow”) and her cosmic-art motive is consistent, but no contradictory impulse ever collides with it; the exile backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, so the “cosmic verse” quest feels pre-ordained, not wrestled with. The moonstone anchoring is the only micro-choice, yet it is passive (hand “drawn”) and carries no visible trade-off. No flaw or misbelief complicates her dance; she ends where she began, untested and unchanged beyond having a tattoo-equivalent. Earned cost is therefore thin; the closure is scenic, not characterological.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glazier’s reflective interiority is concrete and sustained, but no micro-choice on the page is forced by the stone-thrown ripple; observation dominates over decision, so the “commune” remains cerebral, not crucible. Her motive—illuminate value in the mundane—is declared repeatedly yet never tested by a conflicting want or external pressure. The absence of embodied contradiction undercuts the promised “noctilucent reckoning,” leaving her stance essentially unchanged. Earned cost is missing; the closure is a contented exit, not a path foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kael’s stoic-gentle duality is shown through tactile detail (handling the box, reverent tread) and memories of fire loss, not told. Interior contradiction is present—he distrusts superstition yet clutches the box—but the shift from skepticism to messenger-identity is summarized, not dramatized in scene, so the renunciation cost feels soft. Still, his scarred body and “translate pain into language” motive recur and inform every beat, keeping him individual not type. No second character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Aria’s “logical dreamer” label is asserted, never dramatized; she never weighs competing logics or makes a costly choice. Interiority drifts into abstractions (“equations for hope”) without embodied contradiction. The final smile is unearned: no micro-choice on the page forecloses a path or pays a price. Character remains a luminous cipher rather than an agent whose flaws tighten the story.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cartographer’s motive—curiosity about “what walls dream”—remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice shows why THIS question burns. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“a world that was both fragile and resilient”) rather than charged, sensory thought. The only action is rewinding film; no counter-impulse or visible cost attaches to that beat, so the ending’s acceptance feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter’s desire to “persuade mirrors to show possibilities” is stated repeatedly but never tested in a moment of irrevocable choice; she remains a serene observer, humming and brushing, with no contradictory impulse or visible cost. Interiority floats in lyrical generalities—“borrowed heartbeat,” “perceptively calm”—rather than embodied contradiction. The mirrors’ final ripple is gifted from outside, not wrested by a decision that could have failed. Earned stasis is hinted at but not dramatized; the character is more symbol than pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s exhaustion and vulnerability are shown but never sharpened into contradictory micro-choices; the “operatively gentle” trait is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure. Interiority drifts toward cliché (“weight of centuries,” “redemption was steep”) instead of concrete, character-particular thought. No visible cost is exacted from his flaws—gently cradling a clipboard never risks failure or forces a trade-off—so the ending’s peace feels granted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.7)
    The “amoral philanthropist” is sketched only through externalized label and one sentimental token; interiority is abstract (“felt a pang of sentimentality”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices—walking, clutching, releasing water—are present but linear, never forcing a trade-off that shows amorality colliding with sentiment. No credible cost or visible flaw complicates her success, so the arc feels smoothed rather than earned. The egg functions as a prop but her psyche remains undisturbed, keeping characterization functional yet replaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtesan’s interior contradiction—poised body vs. suffocating conformity—remains vivid throughout; the bodily poetic trait is not just label but enacted as she sheds “threads.” Her micro-choice to untangle the final thread is credible and scales to length. Emotional embodiment is strong (“weight of a thousand unspoken words”), avoiding therapy-speak. Earned stasis lands: she forecloses the conformist path with felt cost in the prism flash. Minor slip: “radiating a confidence that was both captivating and unnerving” edges into label-speak, blunting the beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.6)
    Amaranth’s interiority is mostly atmospheric (“otherworldly inspiration”) rather than concrete or contradictory; no micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values, so motivation reads abstract. The “ethics of storytelling” drive is declared repeatedly but never dramatized through a single on-page dilemma or cost. Because no plausible mistake or trade-off is staged, the closure lacks earned renunciation; she simply leaves satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s desire to honor “overlooked histories” is stated repeatedly but never made concrete—no specific history, no moment of friction, no cost. Interiority drifts into abstract lyricism (“stories that lay just beyond the reach of memory”) that feels performative rather than embodied. The moth-wing moment promises a micro-choice, yet she simply knots thread and builds twig signals—actions that could belong to any contemplative drifter. Without a visible contradiction or forfeiture, the arc flattens into mood rather than motive.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Akira’s “technically gentle” trait is shown in dexterous rope-work, but interiority stays generic (“sense of peace,” “labor of love”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; the forgiveness backstory is told once and never tested again, so the arc feels flat rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Hindsight’s interior contradiction—“seeing only in retrospect yet driven to discover why paths choose walkers”—is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a micro-choice that costs something on the page. The dream-vision method is asserted, not embodied; we are told the being “confronts shadows” but no specific embodied emotion or tactile detail shows what this feels like. The final realization (“the path had chosen them”) is an unearned epiphany: no prior beat shows Hindsight resisting or paying a price for that knowledge. Without a visible forfeiture or stance crystallization, the arc reads as label rather than lived conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority is lyric but generic; “empirically ironic” is asserted, never dramatized in a micro-choice. The astronomer’s covenant is announced, not tested under pressure; no felt cost or contradiction drives the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s pacifist-schemer duality is vivid in the opening beat—fingers tracing the broken pin while plotting peace—yet her interiority never complicates beyond noble certainty. The “cellular memory” gambit is asserted, not dramatized through contradiction or risk, so her moment of triumph feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Still, the embodied gesture with the music box and the single-minded focus keep her credibly individual. A hairline slip from 8+ because no micro-choice visibly costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mirror-maker’s hunger for the “runaway dream” is stated early and reasserted, but her interior contradictions are mostly asserted (“spark of curiosity,” “inexplicable connection”) rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choice. The climactic vanishing-into-glass-mountains reads as poetic tableau, not a credible endurance/renunciation with on-page cost; the “firmly grounded” trait quietly disappears instead of colliding with its opposite. Because the sextant’s salvaged curves never materially constrain her tactics or foreclose an option, the final fusion feels willed rather than earned. Voice remains atmospheric, yet the character reads more as mythic operator than specific, fallible agent.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is warm and specific—muttering to trees, ribbon on branch—but her contradictory impulses are told, not dramatized (“vows… had flourished”). Aria’s return is off-stage summary; no moment shows Elara choosing against an alternative, so the renunciation feels foregone rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    Curator’s interiority stays generic—“brightened disquiet” is repeated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the philosophical breakthrough is declared, not earned through visible micro-choices. The decision to follow the Order is passive acceptance, not a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” tag is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a costly micro-choice; the renegotiation beat is summarized, not dramatized, so we never see contradictory impulses collide under pressure. Interiority defaults to abstract labels (“thrill of excitement,” “new sense of purpose”) rather than specific, embodied perception. The time traveler remains a polite cipher—no red-rimmed eyes, no distinct idiom—so relationship-as-crucible never ignites. Closure gives Elara a generic epiphany rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s curiosity is vivid, yet her interiority drifts into abstract labels (“blissfully aberrant”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice shows her chimera-twin gift altering tactics; the card’s clue is received passively. The ending peace feels unearned because no visible cost is paid for the insight. The lack of relational pressure keeps the arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    Emilia’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never sharpened into a concrete contradiction; she observes, nods, and “feels insight” without risking anything or forfeiting an alternative. The professor’s motivation is pure exposition (“attempting to merge the disparate threads”) and never collides with Emilia’s wants, so the shared act lacks personal cost. No micro-choice on the page narrows her future or forecloses a path; the ending affirmation is unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete—her tactile engagement with the echo chamber stone and the way crack‐patterns guide her listening show a believable occupational mind. Contradictory impulses are present (dread of din vs compulsion to map) but remain summarized rather than enacted in a single pressured beat. The final stance—she will “continue to tend the bloom”—is a credible renunciation of rest, yet the cost feels announced (“she felt a sense of satisfaction”) rather than embodied. Voice stays consistent and specific; no stock therapy-speak, but emotional peaks could use more bodily specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority drifts into abstract “desire to prove coincidences have meaning” without embodied contradiction; no micro-choice shows this drive colliding with risk. Custodian’s handling of prism and orrery is passive wonder, not pressured decision; cost is asserted (“shiver”) rather than dramatized. Retrocognitive blessing is label-only; it never complicates or limits action, so the climax feels gifted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.3)
    The archivist’s interiority is evocative but static; she observes and reflects rather than chooses under pressure. No micro-choice alters her tactics; the conjecture is passive reception of memory, not an active sculpting of identity. Emotional embodiment is strong (“shiver down her spine”), yet the promised contradiction and cost of identity-forging never materialize. Closure is a serene acceptance, not an earned renunciation or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is tactile—chanting while walking, registering flame motion through designer eyes—but she never faces a hard choice; the “gravity of hopelessness” is declared, not dramatized. The mosaic note triggers a smile, not a visible cost or relinquished option, so the arc is observation, not transformation. Competence is lovingly shown, yet no contradictory impulse forces a mistake or trade-off; the ending remains a generalized uplift rather than a charged renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chronicler’s interiority is lyrically articulated, but her motives stay abstract—“desire to discover the texture of time” never bites into a concrete want or fear. Because she only watches, no micro-choice under pressure tests contradiction or cost; the closing stance is unchanged, so no earned renunciation. The jade cicada never alters her action, and the frozen couple’s tension is observed, not interacted with, leaving the relationship crucible unused.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s claustrophobia is embodied through the floating ritual; the porcelain doll acts as a tactile proxy for internal state, and the moment of release encodes a micro-choice with cost. Father remains a functional prop; no status crucible, but the single-POV interiority stays coherent and specific. The final stance—“claustrophobia had not vanished”—is an earned stasis that forecloses the old panic without miracle cure, satisfying the 9- gate for credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The gondola operator’s desire to “teach silence how to comfort” is unique and consistently voiced, but she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; the mission is accomplished simply by drifting and noticing. Interiority is lyrically specific (“fluidly logical mind”) yet stays in declarative summary, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice on the page narrows her options or forecloses a path, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested. The storm-glass vial is a lovely sensory anchor, yet it never constrains or changes her tactics—its swirling merely mirrors what we already know.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Aria’s “wisely adventurous” label is asserted, never dramatized; she obeys every cue the ruby flake gives without temptation to deviate, so no internal contradiction is tested. Her moment of “renewed determination” is summary, not embodied choice, so the throne claim feels pre-ordained rather than paid for. The only micro-cost is off-page past whispers, not a live forfeit we witness.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The keeper’s interiority is lyrically consistent and the “tender” trait is embodied through gentle touch and deliberate isolation. The contradiction between caretaking and self-imposed exile is kept alive, but the moment of final change—“they could no longer remain isolated”—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, blunting the arc. The micro-choice to revive the flame is present, yet the emotional ledger feels abstract: we are told the heart feels peace, not shown its price. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature (“loaded emptiness”) stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra’s “virtuously mischievous” grin is mentioned twice but never manifests in a concrete choice; the bolt-touch is the only micro-action. Interiority stays generic (“felt an inexplicable connection”). No contradictory impulses under pressure; she simply follows glitchy instructions. Closure feels lucky, not earned—no visible cost or enduring flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dynasty ender is a passive receptor of visions; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, only awe. Interiority is generic (“flooded with visions,” “maelstrom of images”) rather than embodied. No micro-choice under pressure is shown—turning the crank is repeated identically each time, so no value hierarchy emerges. The final “understanding” is asserted, not earned by on-page renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The knight’s passivity—mostly witnessing and murmuring—keeps interior contradiction theoretical; the single active choice (unsnap) is too late to test traits under rising pressure. Emotion stays atmospheric (“shivering bliss”) rather than embodied contradiction. The allegiance is professed but never complicates tactics or costs him anything on-page, so the “withdrawn” label never collides with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    Interiority is lyric-generic (“broken-hearted archivist” stated, not shown); no embodied contradiction under pressure; final epiphany (“true calling”) is announced, not dramatized with cost. Micro-choices remain archival (cataloging, sifting) but never fork her stance; the soldier’s story does not collide with her own, so no relational crucible or visible flaw is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s interiority is lyrical but generic—no contradictory impulses in-scene, only abstract resolve. The key is clutched, never used under pressure; resourcefulness is told, not tactically shown. Re-appearance is passive—she drifts to the lagoon rather than choosing to break cover. Closure is a soft smile, no visible cost for holding the line.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The saxophonist’s motive (“to hush the prophecy”) is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice or cost; she observes mist, plays, whispers, then vanishes. No interior contradiction, micro-choice, or forfeiture is dramatized—her calm is static, so the “earned hush” feels asserted rather than paid for. The absence of visible stakes or failure keeps the arc in the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The seed sorter’s quiet curiosity and ritual of building twig monuments give her a consistent, particular interiority; her wonder feels embodied, not generic. Yet the transformation is declared (“she knew that she would emerge transformed”) rather than dramatized through a final, costly micro-choice, so the arc slips into summary at the exact moment it should crystalize.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s fixation on discarded timepieces and his “inexplicable connection” to the compass rose give him a clear, if quiet, motive. Yet his interiority stays generic—“a sense of calm,” “a sense of clarity”—and the final epiphany is declared, not dramatized. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene; the device simply works. Still, the single-POV arc of repair → build → embrace uncertainty is credible and stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied (“luminous regret,” “insatiable desire”) and her micro-choice to pick up the coin tilts her toward redemption, but the emotional arc is smoothed into abstractions—no contradictory impulse in scene—and the final “peace” feels declared rather than paid for. The kintsugi metaphor is referenced more than it is dramatized in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Collector’s calm competence is sketched through action, but the “modestly fearless” label is repeated instead of tested; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies the hand-off, so the ending feels benevolent rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid in the medical opening, but once she steps toward the forest the prose abstracts into “mathematics of mercy” shorthand; the mask-strap memory is sensory, yet her final smile feels unearned after such trauma. Agency is present—she forces herself up and walks—but the choice to brave the forest is declared, not dramatized through visible contradiction or cost. Diagnostic self-labeling (“trauma responses”) creeps in at the climax, dulling the embodied immediacy the story needs.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“eternal instant,” “suspended in timeless space”) that tells us she feels awe rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The remembered vocation “to honor overlooked histories” arrives as summary ten lines before the end, so the final resolve feels imported, not earned through on-page micro-choices. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; her flaw (passive receptivity) is named but never complicates tactics under pressure. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the lens fragment is handled in multiple beats, giving her a concrete tactile drive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ezra’s “ghost-seeing” plays only a decorative role; she never makes a consequential choice under that pressure. The mainspring barrel beats feel like theme props rather than personal stakes; her interiority shows no contradictory impulse on the page. We are told she is “skillfully observant” but watch her notice dust trails three beats after they have already been described by the narrator. The closure is a soft drift rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.7)
    The operator’s interiority is lyrically atmospheric but stays at one emotional altitude; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Choices are described (“set to work,” “carefully placed”) rather than pressurized forks with visible trade-offs, so motive intensity plateaus. Cost is poetic (“eternity compressed”) but not corporeal or tactical; we never feel a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—‘burnished sorrow’ felt in the body while she works the shard. Contradictory impulses (rifle vs pen, sorrow vs hope) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—closing the notebook and smiling—earns its charge because the shard-analysis labour has been dramatised. Voice remains coherent, but the ‘defunct’ label is asserted more than tested; one micro-choice under live opposition would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Erebus’s calm-sage interiority is consistent, but the stakes never rise—his goal is static, no contradictory impulse appears, and the final smile is unearned because no cost is dramatized. The single on-page choice is the invisible final screw-turn; everything else is observation. Character is vivid yet pressure-free.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    The petrichor collector’s motivation is declared—“to find the place where explanations fail”—but we watch only passive reception of visions and a final dissolve; no interior contradiction or micro-choice is dramatized that costs her anything. Psychometry is told twice, never shown through bodily or sensory risk. The label “sensibly eccentric” never constrains action; she behaves like any generic seeker. Closure is a diffuse unity image rather than an earned renunciation, so no felt price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aria’s “perpetually learning” trait stays ornamental; only one embodied micro-choice (cleaning the slide) is dramatized. Interiority loops: “she felt a sense of…wonder” repeats four times with no contradictory impulse or cost. No relational crucible; archway and slide supply pressure, yet Aria’s stance at exit mirrors her entry—no visible renunciation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Luna’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is embodied through tactile postcard handling and late-day vigils; the drive feels organic rather than declared. The interior contradiction—yearning for scientific understanding while surrendering to cathedral mysticism—plays out in micro-choices such as tracing paper creases and shifting palette. Her final acceptance of “umbral tenderness” carries visible cost: she forfeits the bright public style that once defined her, shown when the pavilion’s bustle quiets around her new monochrome panels. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the earned stasis of renouncing day-lit renown suffices for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Naomi’s desire to “uncover truth” is declared repeatedly but never crystallized into a single, high-stakes choice; her interiority drifts into generic awe (“inexplicable connection,” “heart ablaze”) rather than embodied contradiction. Ada’s retrocognitive entrapment is only label-deep—no on-page cost or behavioral limit emerges—so the relationship never becomes a crucible that forces Naomi to pay or renounce anything. The ending’s “she would return…until the secrets were fully revealed” is a restatement of the opening want, not an earned change or stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Alchemist’s interiority is vivid—refusing “false comfort” fuels the conceit—but no contradictory impulse ever collides with it; the stance is monolithic. No micro-choice is dramatized: we watch them “ponder,” “recall,” “rise,” never decide under immediate pressure. The promised cost of reimagining a civilization is announced, not paid on this page; thus the arc feels prospective, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scribe’s interiority is lush—anchored in sensory memory, language, and an archival urge that collides with the prophecy it accidentally releases. The field-trip memory works as embodied contradiction (innocence vs. foreboding) that later bleeds into the garden’s patterns. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the solo arc earns a credible renunciation—leaving before the prophecy ripens—whose cost is felt in the final image of the silent foghorn. The only drag is a faint therapeutic gloss (“sense of trepidation”) that slightly blunts the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The “furiously tranquil” duality is asserted repeatedly (7×) but never embodied in distinct micro-choices; interiority drifts into abstract sermon (“she felt an overwhelming sense of purpose”) instead of sensory contradiction. No credible struggle or visible cost attaches to her acceptance of stewardship—she glides from vision to resolution without tightening trade-offs, so the arc feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    Ember’s “credibly curious” trait is asserted repeatedly but never manifests as an on-page contradiction or risky choice; the switch from sirens to bell is externally prompted by a wind lull, not by her agency. Interiority drifts into abstract self-narration (“she felt a sense of satisfaction”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending serenity is declared rather than paid for with a visible renunciation or flaw consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.3)
    Janitor’s interiority drifts into abstract “cosmic” rhapsody; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The single micro-choice—moving the lantern glass—lacks visible cost and changes nothing. Spiritual curiosity is asserted, never tested; vulnerability remains a slogan. The ending renunciation is foreshadowed but not dramatized with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The recluse’s interior contradiction—astonishment at ruin yet tranquil perception—remains vivid and embodied, driving the micro-choice to open the box. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The final renunciation (closing the box, absorbing the words) is earned by the prior beats of reading and tears; the cost is the visible weight that now “radiates” from them. Voice remains coherent and specific, though the astonishment trait is more declared than dramatized in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The timekeeper’s interiority is lyrically textured—‘the texture of time passing’—but remains observer-mode; no contradictory impulses or micro-choice under fire. The urn shard and capsule are handled, yet the emotional jolt is reported, not embodied. Still, the perched, patient attention feels like a credible vocation, and the refusal to surrender meaning is an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.7)
    The poet’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains ambient; she reacts more than chooses. The drake-feather arrival is a gift, not a test, so her smile never risks reversal. No contradictory impulse or micro-choice visibly raises the stakes; the final “peace” is unearned. The arc is a graceful receipt of beauty, not a crucible that changes her.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The skeptic’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs doubt—remains verbal scenery; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The fly amber swings, the footprints appear, yet the pilgrim never tests or renounces anything; the meeting with the entity is immaculate, cost-free. “Academically rebellious” is only asserted, never demonstrated by a risk taken or rule broken. Closure arrives as airy epiphany, not earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coachman’s gentle, almost priestly mission is consistent, but interiority stays at a single register of serene reverence; no contradictory impulse ever threatens his resolve, so the arc is flat. His “vision” and “spiritual connection” are asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices that cost him anything. The only visible decision—scattering one seed pod—lacks stakes or risk, keeping motivation ornamental. Earned change is absent; the piece ends where it began internally.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s past as a body-finder is evoked only through nostril-memory; no present-scene contradiction or micro-choice is driven by that history. Lyra’s scavenger expertise is asserted, not embodied in split-second tool use or status negotiation. The pair’s bond deepens, but the emotional cost is borne by landscape description (“eyes shining with gratitude”) rather than an irreversible renunciation or visible flaw collision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s “blessed pariah” status is asserted, not dramatized; she never collides with another being, so the social cost of pariah-hood is absent. Interiority drifts into stock cosmic awe (“stars twinkling like diamonds”) and therapeutic self-diagnosis (“weight of her temporally stretched existence”). The only embodied choice—sketching—repeats the family custom without visible friction or escalation; the stance shift remains abstract. The ending earns a micro-stance of wonder, but the cost is asserted, not paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Moonwhisper’s “chivalrous thief” identity is asserted but never tested: no victim, rival, or moral friction appears, so the label stays ornamental. Interiority drifts into generic wonder (“heart swelled with a sense of wonder”) rather than contradictory impulse. The pocket-sundial lid is clutched but never complicates, misleads, or costs anything; it could be swapped for any talisman without altering beats. No interior contradiction or visible flaw drives the final swap; success feels pre-ordained, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters function as allegorical postures rather than flesh-and-blood agents; the crisis actor’s “benevolently ruthless” tag is announced but never tested in a costly on-page choice, and the survivor’s interiority is limited to “eyes lit up.” The alliance proposal is the single micro-choice, but it lands as a conceptual pivot without embodied stakes or visible price, so the required earned change/renunciation feels asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The seer’s interiority is textured—“tactile sense that guided her,” “inexplicable jolt of recognition”—but emotions stay performative (“she knew,” “she felt”) rather than embodied under pressure. Motivation (shape a new reality) is declared not dramatized; the final renunciation lacks on-page cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; decisions happen in summary. Still, the mercury-glass identity and buried-talent premise create a memorable, specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    The exiled tutor’s need for self-forgiveness is concrete and embodied in his fraying fingers and red-rimmed eyes; the tapestry decoding directly channels this need into forward action. Internal contradiction is quietly alive—he both courts and fears the truth in the weave. The moment he “rises to his feet” after the last thread is decoded shows a micro-choice that costs him passivity; the guilt-to-redemption arc, though compressed, tracks. Voice stays consistent and specific to a chess teacher’s pattern-seeking mind.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The artist’s interior contradiction—defiance vs. need for forgiveness—stays abstract; no embodied micro-choice under pressure shows the cost of “innocently mischievous” on the page. “Price of forgiveness” is voiced, not dramatized through a renunciation or forfeiture we can touch. Voice cadence is consistent, but trait labels repeat instead of revealing new value hierarchy. Closure peace is asserted, not paid for by visible action, so the arc feels foregone rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelin’s desperation and half-breath stamina are vividly embodied; the mentor-charm memory loops, however, recycle the same beat three times without new contradiction, blunting interior depth. The final collapse is earned by prior oxygen drain, but her “uncertain alchemist” label is never tested by an actual mistake or doubt—she succeeds too smoothly. Micro-choices are present yet narrow; no visible flaw complicates the pattern-matching, so the crucible feels competent rather than genuinely perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.7)
    The painter’s nostalgic pull and quiet rebellion after the mirror crack are credibly evoked, but her interiority drifts into generic “freedom” abstractions; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the renunciation feels predetermined rather than wrested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elian’s interiority is lyrically rendered but static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, only asserted. The “purifying” power of the cork is declared, never tested in a moment that costs him anything. The climax is pure receptive ecstasy, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path; hence no earned change or stasis. Emotions are vividly named but not embodied in conflicting action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    The navigator’s grief is rendered through embodied ritual (turning the censer foot, moon-tuned perception) rather than label-speak, and her endurance at the plain earns a stoic resilience. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where moon-gifted clarity clashes with doubt—so the “raw solace” feels more declared than dramatized. Micro-choices (answering midnight calls, stepping onto the plain) are present but downstream motive stays abstract: why reverse-migrate now, why trust unknown callers? Competence is asserted without visible struggle or failure, blinding us to flaw and therefore growth.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    The forager’s rationality and involuntary honesty are established early and complicate the orchard search; the embodied moment of kneeling to retrieve the glass eye (“half-buried in the damp soil”) gives a concrete micro-choice. Yet interiority drifts into summary (“their truthful nature compelled them to acknowledge the unease”) instead of letting the contradiction play out in scene, and the final resolve is asserted, not dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s observing-only method keeps him passive; the stranger is a cipher, so the relationship crucible is absent. Interiority is atmospheric (“witnessed isolation”) rather than contradictory or embodied. The final clutching of the boutonnière is a micro-choice, but it is the first; prior beats are surveillance, not decisions. Enough for a low-mid 6 band, not the 8+ needed for elite immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority stays concrete—map-shop dust, crumb-trail focus—but the “empirically intuitive” label is announced, not dramatized. Father-promise grief is filter-verbed (“lingering promise she made”) instead of embodied contradiction; no moment shows her intuition failing or costing her. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—she follows ants, she steps through doorway—but the emotional cost stays abstract (“weight lifting”) rather than a felt renunciation. Voice remains coherent; loneliness is shown through selective noticing, yet the flaw-intuition link never complicates the final choice, keeping the arc at solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen’s desire to “unravel the mystery” is repeatedly stated but never dramatized as a wrenching, contradictory choice; her interiority drifts into atmospheric paraphrase (“sense of purpose she had not felt in years”) rather than a visible value hierarchy under pressure. The companion is a silent appendage, supplying no relational crucible or status tension. Earned cost is asserted, not embodied: the final “truth that would change her forever” is withheld from the reader, so the promised alteration feels unmoored from prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never collides with a contradictory impulse; she moves from wonder to wonder without risk or loss. No micro-choice on the page actually costs her anything, so the ending’s “satisfaction” feels unearned. The whispered phrase acts as an external injection of motive rather than an internal fracture. Result: a pleasant observer, not a pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chronicler’s interiority is vivid—"I was getting jealous of my past selves"—but no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the arc is purely reflective, so the final “peace” feels declared rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her synesthetic substitution of “trembling calm” for scent, the clamp screw as emotional probe—but her “mapping” remains an asserted skill rather than a dramatized choice. No contradictory impulse is tested; the loss is mourned, never risked. The micro-turn is purely perceptual, not volitional, so the arc is static admiration rather than earned renunciation. Still, the embodied metaphor palette keeps her above template.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaito’s interiority is textured—his affinity for the quill, the scent-triggered calm, the held-breath suspension—yet the “urge to shed the weight of his past” is stated rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is played out in scene; the transformation into stories is asserted during the writing flow, not tested under pressure. The beat of physical instability (tremor) is noticed but does not force a visible tactic shift or reveal a flaw. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise; the cost is felt, but the character work leading to it is more lyrical accumulation than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into label-speak (“imperfect miracles,” “mystical arts”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The apology motive is declared early yet never tested by an external beat—no risk of rejection, no cost visible—so the final “weight lifts” feels unearned. Micro-choices are limited to lifting the bottle and decoding music; neither action forces a sacrifice or reveals a blind spot. Astra remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible cannot operate; Lyra’s self-forgiveness is circular.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s desire to “unify fragmented truths” is declared early but never tested by an opposing force; she drifts through the temple without a visible cost or contradiction. The dictionary is handled, yet its use stays ornamental—no beat turns on a discovered definition. Interiority leans on lyric labels (“cosmic harmony,” “stillness at the heart of turmoil”) rather than embodied tension. Earned stasis is gestured at but not dramatized; the closing “new path forward” is asserted, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The shepherd’s obsession with “what clocks really measure” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice; the backwards-counting ritual stays interior and does not force an external trade-off. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—merely calm vigilance—so the epiphany feels unearned. The mantle-clock key is handled twice but never operates as a charged extension of will; it never risks or costs anything. Interiority drifts into abstract, diagnostic phrasing (“concept fascinated and intimidated”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lena’s interiority is consistent—her spatial knack and nocturnal habit feel lived-in—but the “physics of letting go” remains an abstract label; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The laser-pointer twitch is a nice embodied tic, yet it never alters her tactics or costs her anything. “Familiar strangers” are noticed, not interacted with, so no relationship crucible tests her. The ending converges on wonder, but the beat is summary, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path; competence outweighs struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lucid—her academic lens on “lucid contradictions” feels lived—but her motives plateau. The phrase “clover melancholy” is repeated without new embodiment, so the emotional arc stalls at mid-range stakes. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; still, her final resolve costs nothing we haven’t already seen, keeping the change incremental rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority is abstract (“taught endings how to begin”) and never embodied; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized, only summarized. The operator remains a benevolent archetype, never conflicted or contradictory, so the promised moral complexity stays off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority is mostly mood-labeled (“pang of melancholy,” “haunted euphoria”) rather than embodied; no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The archivist’s only micro-choice is to stow the photo—low-stakes, no visible cost—so the required earned change/renunciation is absent. Gently-thorough trait is asserted, never dramatized under pressure. Thus character feels illustrative, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Raven’s loneliness is stated but never embodied in gesture or contradiction; the “desperately jocular” mask is announced, not dramatized. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure—Raven drifts rather than decides. The moon-rock plan is motive, yet we never feel the ache that powers it. Closure is soft: loneliness dissolves off-page in collective warmth, so the cost is implied, not internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    A single, nameless blind mapmaker carries the entire interior burden; we get embodied emotion (“skin tingled,” “heart swelled”) and a clear hierarchy of values—stillpoint > safety. Yet the only micro-choice shown is the act of following notes; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final “understanding” feels announced rather than earned. The tattoos absorb languages, but this trait never constrains or costs on the page; it decorates rather than complicates choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria’s interiority is consistent—her “confidently uncertain” stance shows in micro-choices like planting the wrong seeds and unbending the nib—but the emotional cost is stated (“grave mistake”) rather than embodied; the pen’s reactivation feels more conceptual than tactile, so the final charge is muted, not crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The advisor’s quietly charismatic magnetism is shown through the crowd’s unforced gathering, but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized in scene. The old man’s motivations are sketched via sign-language story, yet the advisor’s own stakes beyond “translate silence into music” stay abstract; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Because the final bonding moment is tender but cost-free, the emotional progression feels complete yet not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s obsession with the promise is declared repeatedly but never dramatized as a live dilemma; the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“volcanic tenderness”) rather than concrete, contradictory impulse. No micro-choice under pressure shows the arsonist’s specific risk calculus inside the archive. The climactic “touch” of the tapestry feels symbolic, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s quietly rebellious streak surfaces only in the drumming; the treatment’s promised memory-untangling stays off-page, so her interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized. The “auroral sorrow” is repeated emotion-labeling without bodily cost. Still, the final renunciation of the fading light lands as a credible Earned Stasis, legible because her earlier drumming tried to freeze time.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.4)
    The worker’s desire to “prove whispers travel farther than shouts” is announced like a thesis, never tested by a costly choice; interiority stays generic (“a thrill of excitement”), and the final smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The stranger’s whisper is coincidence, not a crucible that forces her to pay or renounce anything. She remains observant but passive, a cataloguer rather than an agent.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    The guardian’s interiority is only gestured at (“expression unreadable” twice), so motivation remains an abstract phrase (“teach darkness the value of stars”) rather than a dramatized stake. No micro-choice shows why the mirror or the pattern matters to them; they merely watch. The figure is a prop-delivery device, not a second source of pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Endurance without visible cost or contradiction earns only partial credit for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s interiority stays vague—“a sense of purpose,” “heart filled with wonder”—without concrete contradiction or embodied cost. No micro-choice visibly risks or forfeits anything; the rebellion’s success feels gifted by narration rather than earned by pressured decision. The “cradle” image is stated but never tested against a competing value, so the arc flats into affirmation. Closure is declarative, not dramatized: “the town continued to evolve” tells us change occurred without showing Elian paying a price for it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s wiry physicality and dock-worker instincts are shown through tactile micro-choices (tying crates, slipping into the water), but the “thousand unspoken stories” remain abstract; interiority drifts toward poetic placeholders rather than a contradictory, character-specific psyche. The scrimshaw obsession is declared, not dramatized in visible trade-offs, so the final heart-unlocking feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. Still, her body-in-motion presence and the renunciation of past weight supply a credible, if lightly sketched, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Echo’s blank-face trait is vividly embodied in the dramatic narrations that contradict the mask; the whittling and bouquet beats show micro-choices that externalize grief. Yet the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible mistake that costs them—narration stays safe. Moral ambiguity is asserted (“they existed in a state…”) rather than dramatized through a beat where we see the trade-off. Still, the wooden trinkets and final silence give us a credible, earned endurance that forecloses the path of overt feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is lush and texture-rich: “her eyes drinking in the serene beauty,” “a tremor of certainty.” Still, contradiction is mostly lyrical rather than enacted—she never hesitates or tests an alternative—and the ending’s “sense of liberation” is declared, not dramatized through a costly micro-choice. The character feels individuated, but the arc is one of steady ascent without a visible trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority stays surface-level: “he began to ponder,” “his eyes lighting up with excitement” are tell-not-show abstractions; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The painter’s color-blindness is declared but never shapes a micro-choice that costs him something; the glassblower’s shift to “intentionally imperfect” pieces is reported, not dramatized. Motivation is coherent but static—no visible stakes or flaw-compounded mistake forecloses a path. Relationships exist only as mutual admiration, never forcing a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bell-ringer’s gentle curiosity is embodied in tactile lens-cleaning and sound-coaxing, but interiority stays generic (“felt an inexplicable connection”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the pilgrimage is declared, not tested under pressure, so the final smile feels unmotivated—no visible cost or renunciation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The jeweller’s grief-to-recovery arc is legible, but interiority stays abstract (“turmoil within,” “subdued ardor”) and never crystallises into a contradictory, body-level choice. The single visible micro-choice—placing origami—lacks visible cost or risk; success feels preordained rather than wrested. Emotional states are named, not embodied; no moment shows the body betraying or overriding intent. The arc satisfies the closure gate (resonant reconfiguration via the blooming brooch) but remains emotionally generalised.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.4)
    The cartomancer’s “steadily curious” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulse or costly choice; she measures and notes without error, struggle, or visible consequence, so the interiority feels flat. The inherited-mystery motivation is summarized, not pressure-tested, so the arc is observation-only, lacking earned change or renunciation. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the ending satisfaction is declared rather than paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The historian’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a concrete, risky choice; she passively receives the pagoda and its vision. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values—she simply “gazes” and is flooded with knowledge. The “anguished joy” is declared rather than embodied; we get no bodily cost or irreversible forfeiture. Closure is a mood, not an earned renunciation or decision, so the change feels external to her.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dusk noticer’s interiority is lyrically particular (“luminous regret”) and her tactile attention to the river stone embodies emotion, but she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the decision to “share her findings” is declared, not dramatized. Reflection outweighs action (~40%), so the arc feels observed rather than forged under pressure. The flaw is not fatal, yet the absence of a charged, on-page renunciation or risk keeps the characterization just shy of high-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete and grounded in tactile care; her contradictory pull between dogma and doubt is shown through micro-gestures rather than label-speak. The chameleon beat crystallizes her shift without overt diagnosis. Cost is felt: she forfeits the certainty that once drove her vocation, yet the arc stops a hair short of forcing her to act on this loss in a visible way—no tool broken, no relationship sundered—so the change is inward, almost too safe.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s “closure-seeker who opens wounds” premise is evocative, but interiority slips into lyrical abstraction (“maelstrom of images and emotions”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The plant-telepathy trait is named twice yet never alters a tactical choice or costs Elian anything, so it reads as label-only. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned shift is the quiet Charged Poise in the chamber, but the cost feels conceptual rather than personally stakes-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal gazer’s interiority is almost entirely abstract—“felt an inexplicable pull,” “knew they were about to uncover”—so we never see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. No micro-choice alters the present situation; the character only observes and receives. The arc is therefore a static revelation rather than a tested stance, so the needed cost/earning is missing. What saves the score is the consistent vocation-driven motive and the single, if passive, absorption of the love-residue.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically consistent but floats in generalized awe; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The “trapped creativity” stake is asserted, never tested through an on-page choice that costs her anything concrete. Micro-choices (adjusting the astrolabe, tracing stars) are ritualistic, not tactical; they don’t narrow or foreclose options. Earned change is declared rather than embodied—she simply “knew” she’d succeeded at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Asa is sketched in evocative strokes—dreamless freight guard, wave-function meditator—but interior contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized. The archive’s pull is felt as ambient magic, not as a hard choice that forks her wants; the moment she re-animates the chess clock is beautiful yet cost-free, so no path is foreclosed. The “merging” at the end reads as rapture rather than earned renunciation, blunting the required visible cost. Still, her perceptual lens is distinct and steadily maintained, keeping the score north of mid-line.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.3)
    The philosopher is sketched only in generic wonder; no contradictory impulses, micro-choice, or embodied cost appear on-page. “Pondered,” “sought,” “wandered” are summary verbs—no moment shows him risking or forfeiting anything. Closure is a vague smile and a vibrating gear; no earned stasis or visible price. Interiority drifts into prompt-label abstractions (“probable miracles,” “wild frontier of mind”) rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.7)
    Eira’s gentleness and persistence are repeated labels, never dramatized by a moment where her restraint costs her or alters tactics. The travelers remain an anonymous chorus; no interior contradiction or individual choice surfaces. “Unused courage” is asserted, not embodied in any character’s micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.7)
    The bellhop’s interior contradiction—vow of silence vs. ache for voice—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice on the staircase alters tactics. The “faint mark” is noticed, not acted upon; silence is endured but never tested under pressure. The final “sense of peace” is declared, not dramatized; cost is asserted, not felt. Result: a credibly haunted stance, yet no visible stakes shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael’s motivation is stated—unmask the pretender—but we never see interior contradiction or a costly micro-choice; the plan unfolds flawlessly without visible flaw or stake. The “diminutive titan” label never alters action; could swap size adjective with no effect. Emotional states are summarized (“quiet excitement”) rather than embodied. No beat shows Kael risking failure or forfeiting anything, so the mission feels pre-ordained, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s grief for the reefs is palpable, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“eternal flux,” “drifting moored”) that tells us the emotion rather than embodying it. The drum-tapping ritual is a vivid micro-choice, yet it never forces a real trade-off or risk; the station’s data could have been lost or her reef time forfeited, but nothing is staked. The final “she is part of the ocean’s story” epiphany is declared, not dramatized through a costly action or renunciation. Character is individuated and consistent, but the arc lacks a visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is concrete—“bare feet carried her forward” links body to resolve—and the awkward confidence surfaces once (“awkwardly confident, a trait that manifested in her deliberate strides”). Yet the arc drifts into summary: the hum merely “reignited the flame,” so we’re told, not shown, the decisive micro-choice. Interior contradiction is absent; she never doubts the pilgrimage, so pressure stays flat. The ending feels fore-ordained rather than earned at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Akira’s insurgent-granny grit is vivid in gesture and sensory filter, but interiority slips into label-speak (“implanted destiny unfolding within her”) that over-explains the epiphany. The telepathy quirk is shown—plants whisper and sway—yet the beat where it decodes the kite fails to reveal a contradictory impulse or cost, so the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Still, her embodied wariness and the trembling retrieval of the orb earn a credible endurance that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amira’s grief is vivid and embodied, but the “quiet talent” label is repeated without dramatized contradiction; no micro-choice shows her skill causing risk or cost. The interior monologue stays in generic therapy-speak (“anchor optimism in realism”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. Closure is Earned Stasis yet feels serene rather than costly because no alternative path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority is poetic but generic; “crestfallen” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulses in scene—only abstract self-interrogation. The final “redesign” is declared, not dramatized; cost is metaphorical smoke. Voice remains atmospheric, not individual.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—“serene anger” is a sharp, specific contradiction—but the missing person remains a cipher: no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, just a placid mask. The final shared gaze is declared connection rather than dramatized reconfiguration; cost is asserted (“time seemed to slow”) not felt. Motive for the chase is stated, yet no micro-choice on the page is driven by the time-dilation obsession; the climax is passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s indigo eyes and preservation-gel gloves give a vivid sensory hook, but interiority is delivered in abstract labels (“bravely conflicted heart”) rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to release the letter is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices under escalating pressure; we never see her hesitate at a console or delete a failsafe. The moment of irreversible upload—the story’s hinge—happens off-stage, so the cost is asserted, not felt. What saves the score is the coherent arc from reverence to rebellion and the single, legible flaw that powers it: her need to break archival silence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s pacifism is embodied in every beat—tending roses, refusing the sword, sheltering refugees—so her traits drive action, not summary. The “senselessly perceptive” tag stays latent, never complicates a choice or costs her anything; interiority drifts toward serene abstraction rather than contradiction under pressure. Father’s sword earns a quiet renunciation, but the causal chain is thin: we hear no moment when wielding almost happened, so the cost feels pre-emptively resolved. Still, her stance crystallizes in the final image, giving a modest but genuine Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fisher’s calm, zig-zag perseverance is consistent, yet her interiority stays lyric-generic (“heart sang with excitement and reverence”) rather than concrete and contradictory under pressure. The rail spike is handled but never alters her tactics or costs her anything; it’s a prop, not a tool that forces choice. Because the goddess-echo arrives as gift rather than earned reversal, the closure feels visited upon her, not driven by visible flaw or gamble. Still, her quiet, pattern-tuned stance is individual enough to clear stereotype and earns a credible micro-endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.6)
    Adelaide’s desire to “discover hidden truths” is declared repeatedly but never embodied in a specific, contradictory choice under pressure; she only ponders and descends. The pen nib triggers calm rather than a visible micro-choice that alters tactics; no interior contradiction is dramatized in scene. “Proof by contradiction” stays abstract, so the moment of potential renunciation or cost is summarized, not shown. The result is a motivated stance but no earned change or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tattooist’s interior contradiction—guilt for an unnamed past choice vs. the need to quiet it through baby-cry translation—is concrete and embodied (she fingers the amber, knots the cord). Micro-choices under pressure are visible: she reaches for the cord when reality thins, and that act steadies her. The final renunciation of guilt is earned by the causality of reading the letters and confronting the firmware whispers. Cost is legible: she forecloses the haunted loop and accepts the meteor hush, leaving the needles still but creativity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward self-diagnosis (“she was in the midst of the unlearning”). The mandala work supplies embodied micro-choices, yet the final smile feels tidy; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Social perceptiveness stays observational—never complicates action—so the trait remains decorative. Still, the contradiction between control and surrender is credibly sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aria’s interior contradiction—tenderness vs. “arms of steel”—is embodied in the tessera squeeze and the renaming act; the “warm coldness” is felt rather than labelled. Motivation stays legible: salvage compassion from ruins. No second character on page, so status/relationship crucible waived. Final renunciation (accepting perpetual grief-watch) is earned by the retrocognitive cost she pays on the chipped stone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    Echo’s longing for an encore is declared repeatedly but never enacted as a concrete choice; she passively touches the coin and “begins to weave” off-stage. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her nostalgia, so the arc feels performed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    Luna’s affectionate skepticism animates the opening beats—the geode is “carefully examined,” the telepathy recall is “fascinated and intimidated”—but the interiority soon drifts into poetic labels (“willowglass hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. The geode-in-hand anchors micro-choices until the static shock recalibrates perception, yet the later “danced between the light sources” feels performed rather than pressured. A visible cost is present—the pill supply is gone—but the final smile is serene rather than charged by the earlier risk. Still, the single-POV voice stays particular and the motivation is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s curiosity and vocation register, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“exhilarating and unsettling”) rather than dramatized. No hard choice or renunciation closes the arc; the fossil anchors mood yet never forces a costly turn. Competence dominates over struggle, flattening flaw-driven tension. The motivational line “voice of the unknown” is repeated, not pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    The hourglass turner’s quietly inspired patience is shown through deliberate micro-choices—lifting the jar, listening to sand, cataloging buttons—that embody his trait without label-speak. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial (“listen to the whispers of the sands”), avoiding epiphany jargon. Motivation (“spin a prophecy into raw possibility”) is repeatedly restated rather than tested by escalating stakes, so compulsion plateaus. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; flaw balance is acceptable but struggle never sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    The burned-spy interiority is vivid—scar tissue as perpetual reminder, pillbox as tactile conscience—but her contradictory impulses are reported rather than enacted in scene. The decisive hand-clasp with her mirror-self is emotionally resonant yet causally unearned: no prior micro-choices foreshadow this reintegration, so the epiphany feels imported rather than discovered under pressure. Still, the embodied burn memory and pocketed pillbox keep her from sliding into generics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coachman’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; no contradictory impulses are dramatized on page. His vow to “distill complexity into essence” is announced, never tested by a micro-choice that costs him anything. The arrival of the young lady prompts only a nod and a smile—no visible hierarchy of values or risk. Interiority settles into meditative summary rather than embodied decision, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    Akira’s “phototropic” trait is label-speak until the lantern glass gives it one embodied moment; the interiority never fractures under pressure, so the promised zen contradiction stays abstract. The final “sharp gentleness” is performed, not dramatized—she simply packs up, so the renunciation carries no palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.7)
    The fire-escape gardener’s interiority is lyric but thin: “wistfully pragmatic” is stated, never embodied through contradictory impulse or visible trade-off. Actions (pruning, pocketing the tooth) stay on one emotional register; no spike of stress tests hierarchy of values. Reflection on the lockmaster stays ornamental; it neither tilts a present micro-choice nor forecloses a path with cost. The character ends where he began: a serene caretaker—no earned stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is textured—her fingers “coaxing secrets” from brass, the vibration in her chest—but emotions stay in lyrical register without body contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solitary stance is coherent yet static, culminating in a soft renunciation rather than a crucible choice. The reincarnation memory is recalled, not dramatized, so motivational causality is attenuated; the earned stasis feels more mood than cost. Voice remains consistent and atmospheric, but the lack of tightening beat keeps her below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s interiority is lyrical but drifts toward thematic summary (“seeking the thread that connected all things”). The twig spiral offers a tactile micro-choice, yet her arc stabilizes without a visible cost; the realization is gentle, not stinging. Whimsy is named, not tested under pressure. Earned stasis feels light, but the single-POV lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s cautious hope is shown through concrete risk-calibration at the dials and the embodied shiver when the hum arrives, but her interior contradiction never sharpens into a forced micro-choice that costs her anything; the “thrill of satisfaction” is label-speak that flattens the peak beat. No visible flaw or limit complicates her success, so the arc feels smoothed rather than earned. The colleagues remain a faceless chorus, supplying no status pressure or alternative stance, so the relationship crucible is absent. Closure is a clean win without renunciation or stasis, so the emotional price is only asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Claustrophobia is named, not dramatized—no panic, spatial constriction, or decisions forced by enclosed space. “Prudently adventurous” surfaces only as tag, never as visible trade-off. Interiority defaults to stock wonder-phrases (“burning need,” “electric thrill”) rather than embodied contradiction. Final insight is declared, not earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.7)
    Artist’s “desire to lance the boil of her own emotional numbness” is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. Detective’s epiphany about empathy is interior summary, not embodied under pressure. Relationship remains static—no status shift forced by quarry or mask ribbon.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    Interiority is vivid—“copper nail pulsing” embodies ancestry—but contradictory impulses stay latent; no micro-choice forces trade-off. Emilia’s desire to “honor bravery” remains abstract until final line; cost is intellectual, not visceral. No relationship crucible; station is solitary. Closure is a suspended question, not earned renunciation—so the 9+ quick test fails.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fiddler’s interiority is lyrically sustained yet generic—“luminous disbelief,” “world unfolding like a map”—without a single concrete micro-choice that shows how the amnesty alters their next breath. Emotions are named, not embodied; the only bodily cue is “shiver down their spine,” a cliché that flattens the moment they decipher the secret. The arc is drift, not decision: they observe, remember, play, depart—no path is foreclosed, no cost is visibly paid. The closure is a mood, not a stance, so the promised redemption feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s calm-perceptive lens is concrete and sustained, but his interior contradictions stay static; the “startup scar” backstory explains mood rather than forcing a present-tense micro-choice. No second character enters, so relationship crucible is N/A. The ending’s renunciation is reported, not dramatized, so the cost is felt only abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra’s desire to decode the inscriptions is declared early and steadies her night’s work, but we never see an interior contradiction or micro-choice that tightens the stakes; the “heals with words” gift is asserted, never dramatized or costed. Emotion stays at a soft register of “purpose” and “solace,” delivered in summary rather than embodied beats. No visible flaw or blind spot complicates her progress, so the ending’s uplift feels unearned. The characterization is coherent but thin—more luminous sketch than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    The druid’s interiority is thick with thematic language (“warlike serenity,” “deep-seated desire”) instead of character-specific contradiction; no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values until the mirror-touch, which arrives as an epiphanic gift rather than earned cost. Frozen-past figure functions as plot device, not relationship crucible, so emotional stakes remain abstract. Seed is carried but never activates under pressure, flattening potential flaw-compulsion. “Finds lost things” triggers the encounter yet exerts no visible trade-off or limitation—trait behaves like authorial GPS.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s “root-bound visionary” label is repeated but never embodied—no tactile soil contact, no botanical micro-choices. Interiority drifts into abstract wonder (“intersection of dreams”) without contradictory impulse. The final “step forward” is unmotivated: we aren’t shown what option she just forfeited, so the cost is only declared. Trait-to-action linkage stays ornamental; she never risks failure or trades anything away.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into diagnostic self-labeling (“darkness within her,” “holes in her soul”) that blurs embodied contradiction; the burned card momentarily externalizes flaw, yet no micro-choice after the pickup visibly alters tactics or reveals hierarchy of values under pressure—spell-weaving is asserted, not dramatized. Closure achieves Earned Stasis, but cost is gestural (“weight of her soul lifting”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.7)
    Jack’s interiority is vivid in the early beats—his fingers on the grille cloth, the quarry twilight as emotional mirror—but the decisive turn rests on an asserted rather than dramatized pivot. “He would wrestle his future into shape” states intent; we don’t see him override any concrete obstacle or forfeit anything on the page, so the closure cost is conceptual, not character-proven. The “confidently uncertain” duality stays verbal; no contradictory impulse is forced into action. Still, the embodied nostalgia and rock-dust smell keep him above generic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s kindly methodical nature is named repeatedly but never costs her anything; the seed glows, she ponders, the mist swirls—no micro-choice shows the trait constricting or enabling action. Interiority drifts into abstract paraphrase (“she began to ponder…”) rather than embodied contradiction. Because the closure is a soft epiphany rather than a renunciation with visible price, the required “earned change with cost” test fails.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The librarian’s interiority is poetic but abstract—moods shift with moon phases yet no embodied contradiction forces an on-page choice. The bamboo creel functions as symbol, not pressure; no micro-choice stakes the librarian’s identity. The “preserve wonder” motive is asserted, not dramatized; closure is stasis, not renunciation with cost. No second character enters, so status/relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria’s interiority remains abstract (“inexplicable connection,” “sense of purpose”) rather than embodied; no contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure. The pearl-shell epiphany is declared, not earned through micro-choices that cost her anything visible. Occupation title is stated but never informs her decisions or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief-driven quest for self-forgiveness is credibly interior, contradictions show in her simultaneous clinging to and relinquishing of the map. The accordion’s patched bellows externalizes her “mended/broken” self-concept in every beat it appears. Micro-choices—spreading the map, playing the lament, pocketing the notebook—track a hierarchy of values: memory > comfort > forward motion. Withdrawal from medication is named but not dramatized through perceptual distortion; the river-whisper device edges toward therapy-speak (“the river’s wisdom”), softening the flaw without capsizing the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The veiled dreamer is a serviceable yet schematic protagonist: interiority is limited to “reverence,” “cautious exuberance,” and “burning motivation”—all abstract labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the watch is picked up passively, and the final crossing of the doorway is summarized, not tested. The veil and the watch are repeatedly mentioned but never complicate perception or force a trade-off, so the promised flaw/struggle never materializes. Earned cost is absent; the closing “forever changed” is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s interiority is lush—telepathic orchid-touch, coffee-stain divination—but her dream vs. empire crisis is asserted, not dramatized; no contradictory micro-choice under pressure forecloses a path. The “mulberry ache” is evocative yet abstract; we’re told the promise dims, not shown one visible forfeiture that scales to 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aria’s death-longing is palpable in her tactile reverence for the emerald and her hush-craving interiority; the “threshold of stillness” functions as an embodied, contradictory motive that crystallizes in the final infusion. Micro-choices—polishing, attuning, coaxing—track an ascending arc from grief to surrender, earning the closing Earned Stasis. Missing only a sharper contradiction under peak pressure to hit the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.1)
    Aria’s caretaker trait seeds early action (pruning, watering) but never constrains later choice; the “kindly decisive” label is repeated without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that costs her anything. The hairpin’s draw is asserted (“inexplicable connection”) rather than dramatized, so interiority stays abstract. No visible flaw complicates her arc; she glides from discovery to serenity without a test that forecloses an option, leaving the closure stasis unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conscience’s “sincerely insincere” mask is asserted repeatedly but never tested in a visible choice; the interior contradiction is announced, not dramatized. The client remains off-stage, so no relationship crucible or status shift can occur. The shard momentarily reflects the conscience’s own fragility, but this beat is summarized, not embodied, so the protected vulnerability feels declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The researcher’s desire to teach is declared, not dramatized; she never makes a micro-choice that risks anything or reveals contradiction. The student remains a passive mirror, so no relationship-as-crucible pressure exists. “Backwards aging” is never leveraged as a trait that complicates the lesson—no memory lapse, no bodily limit, no visible cost—so the unique attribute stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The skimmer’s historically reverent nature is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a concrete, pressured choice; it “appraises” the arrowhead only through passive observation, so no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page. The interiority drifts into thematic paraphrase (“learn to navigate without moving”) rather than moment-specific emotion or micro-choice. The final “synchronizing pulse” is presented as serene resolution, not a renunciation that forecloses an option with felt price. Consequently, the character arc is decorative, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eira’s underachievement is asserted, not dramatized; her “stagnant creativity” is repeated rather than shown through botched spell-craft or social humiliation. The interiority drifts into thematic commentary (“she feared she was succumbing…”), dampening embodied emotion. The keystone moment supplies a micro-choice (touch/release) but the cost is atmospheric, not personal—no visible flaw or trade-off is risked or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s curiosity is named but never tested; he drifts rather than chooses. No contradictory impulse or felt cost when he “signifies” by wandering. The interiority is atmospheric, not revelatory—he never doubts, fears, or sacrifices. Closure is an epiphany without prior contradiction, so the change feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.6)
    The “quietly enthusiastic” label is repeated but never embodied; the narrator’s only visible motions are pouring liquid and drinking the droplet—both calm, low-stakes gestures. Interiority is generic cosmic awe rather than contradiction under pressure. The final alignment feels declared, not earned: no micro-choice shows a renounced alternative or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.2)
    The reaper’s grief is rendered in lyrical, embodied strokes (“heartbroken… felt the weight… bittersweet ache”), but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a concrete micro-choice that costs something on the page. The atlas page and recordings function as evocative props, yet the reaper’s stance toward them stays static; no moment of “no, not this” or “yes, despite that” crystallizes. The ending’s “peace settle over them” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible renunciation or fresh risk. Emotional specificity is high, but causal specificity is missing, so the arc feels atmospheric rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mage’s “earnestly naive” label is interior wallpaper; no contradictory impulse or visible cost emerges from that trait. The only micro-choice—drip-rate repair—is executed flawlessly, so devotion never truly brittles. Interiority drifts into abstract self-exposition (“cosmic imbalance”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure arrives as triumph, not renunciation, so the promised fragility is never tested on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    The warden’s interiority is evocative—camera-clicks, scent of decay, the liqueur label as talisman—but stays observational; no fork-in-the-road moment forces a visible cost or contradiction, so the promised “expunge” action feels conceptual rather than embodied. The precisely-humane trait is announced, never pressure-tested. Still, perceptual detail is character-specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lush—“quiet reverence,” “mesmerizing display of pattern and chaos”—but remains observational; no contradictory impulse forces a costly choice. Sentimentality is asserted, not tested under pressure. The moment of highest agency—melting the crystal—reads as curiosity, not stakes-laden decision, so the arc lands as wonder-track rather than character-change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s interiority stays concrete—fingers brushing the buckle, muscle-memory gear work—so her competence feels lived-in. The watcher’s burden is shown as tangible pressure (buckle talisman, peer trust) rather than label-speak. Her micro-choice to stay at the arbor until dawn crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: physical fatigue, fading stars, solitary risk.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaito’s interiority is vivid—his gaze “slices through pretense” and the brain-jar watches him—yet the emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized: we are told “a surge of determination” instead of seeing micro-choices that cost him. The ego-death backstory is asserted, not tested in scene, so the turn from numbness to felt aliveness is declared, not embodied. The clone-custody stakes never materialize as on-page pressure; the brain remains a static symbol rather than a crucible that forces a forked decision. Earned stasis is claimed (“he was free”) but no path is foreclosed on the page, blunting the closure’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    The proprietor’s interiority is vividly rendered through her tactile handling of the seed and her iterative theorizing, but the “orthogonal approaches” remain abstract schema rather than dramatized micro-choices. Her motivation—to safeguard creative space—stays thematic; no moment shows her refusing a safer commercial option or paying a concrete cost for innovation. The emotional arc is a smooth ascent from curiosity to anticipation, lacking a contradictory impulse that would complicate her stance. Consequently, the closure feels like a tidy creative ignition rather than an earned renunciation or charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maestro Elwes’s mournfully eager stance is reiterated rather than embodied; his only micro-choice—pull the cord—does not evolve under pressure. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; interiority drifts into lyric shorthand (“savoring the silence”) that never turns against him. The ending’s soft smile lands as sentimental decal, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.2)
    The guardian’s interiority is lyrically voiced but remains abstract—“dimensional homesickness,” “friends with uncertainty”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that dramatizes the shift from burden to acceptance. The pendant’s glow is registered, never handled in a way that reveals hierarchy of values; the beat of “closed her eyes…let the mist seep” is the only visible action, too late to earn the final poise. No persistent flaw or cost is legible on-page; the emotional arc is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    The alchemist’s “stoically sensitive” contradiction is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a micro-choice; interiority hovers in poetic labels (“felt a mixture of awe and trepidation”) rather than embodied sensation. The one decisive action—channeling energy into the crozier—emerges too cleanly, with no visible cost or struggle that would individuate the character. Motive is declared (“interrupt a stifling destiny”) yet never complicated by fear, doubt, or bodily consequence, so the ending’s change feels pre-ordained, not earned through flaw or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s “celestial signal interpreter” tag is never embodied—no tool, no jargon, no sensory signature of her gift. Interiority floats in generic wonder (“serenely electric”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. The only micro-choice—stooping for the star fragment—reads as pre-ordained, not pressured. No contradiction or visible cost forecloses her path; she simply receives epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and “resiliently positive” tag are declared repeatedly, but no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure dramatizes that trait; her decision to enter the grotto is reported, not wrestled with, so the arc reads as observation, not crucible. The empty hourglass and vanishing-ferry clues never force her to act, endure, or renounce anything on-page, so no visible cost is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The “fever dream architect” is more concept than person; interiority is poetic but abstract (“mind was consumed by the concept of rational enchantment”) rather than dramatized via concrete contradiction or embodied emotion. She makes no true micro-choice under pressure—only passive observation and weaving—so the promised arc of discovery lands as narration, not earned change. Cost is asserted (“unsettling calm”) but not paid on the page. Voice remains consistent, but the character never risks or forfeits anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lyra’s motivation to “unravel mysteries” is declared repeatedly but never sharpened into a concrete want/fear; her only on-page choice is to teach, which costs nothing and does not evolve. No interior contradiction or embodied emotion undercuts the stoic-guide archetype, so the character remains a smooth vessel for theme rather than a pressured individual. The students are a faceless chorus; their absence as distinct foils denies Lyra any status crucible, leaving her arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s curiosity is asserted (“persistently curious gaze”) but never complicates her choices; the sister’s grief is sketched only in tears, not contradictory impulses. The decisive beat—offering comfort—restates her job description rather than revealing a new cost or flaw. Interiority stays generic (“felt an instant connection”), never anchoring in idiosyncratic thought. No micro-choice under pressure is haunted by a visible mistake or trade-off, so the renunciation lacks sting.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Claustrophobia is named, never embodied; no tight-space panic or contradictory urge to squeeze deeper. “Stand by the unremembered” stays abstract—no micro-choice shows her weighing their lives against her own. Interiority drifts into summary: “She felt a deep connection” tells us the emotion rather than letting coral-scraped knuckles or failing torch battery speak. The phase-return choice is causally soft: she steps into a torrent and is “pulled through,” no visible cost or flaw-compounded error.

    Akira’s interior contradiction—obsession with mortality yet hunger for transcendence—remains vivid, but her heartbeat-counting never alters a visible choice; the porcelain shard glows but never constrains action. The “fetch wisdom from failure” motive is asserted, not dramatized through escalating stakes. Closure is quiet acceptance rather than earned renunciation, so the cost feels ambient, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The storyteller’s quiet desire to preserve vanishing echoes is palpable, but the piece never dramatizes a moment where that motive is tested or forced to a costly choice; interiority stays atmospheric rather than contradictory under pressure. No micro-choice is shown where the diamond or birds create a forked path with stakes. The “harness” is asserted, not embodied in a beat that could fail. The result is a lyrical consciousness rather than a character whose limits or flaws compound.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s undercover persona and gravitationally-playful coping mechanism are stated but never embodied in a micro-choice; the arrowhead jolt is sensation, not decision. The only action she takes—lifting the phone—changes her perception yet costs her nothing and alters no relationship or tactic. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“turn bitterness into a cosmic joke”) rather than contradiction under pressure. No earned flaw or visible price forecloses a future path; the ending posture is observation, not renunciation or commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Luna’s yearning is lyrical yet generic—no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page. The statues’ shift from stone to flesh is reported, not chosen, so no cost accrues to her. Interiority stays at postcard level: “she smiled, knowing…” etc. The locust shell is clutched but never used to risk or renounce anything.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract—“desire to find where broken promises heal” is thematic label-speak, not embodied contradiction. One micro-choice (crossing the border) exists, yet the cost is under-felt; the bottle’s transfer carries more charge than his stake. Still, the rebel-mailman persona is consistent and the job ethic under drone peril is believable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Carpenter’s “quietly persistent” trait is asserted repeatedly but only once shown (following the song). Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“whispering gleam in their eyes”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after meeting the singer alters later carving; persistence stays ornamental. Earned stasis is hinted but cost is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    The librarian’s “sanely eccentric” tag is repeated but never tested under pressure; she performs no consequential micro-choice that costs her anything. Her interiority drifts into generic awe (“sense of wonder and awe”) instead of contradictory impulses acted out in scene. The tattered scarf glows, yet she never reacts to it in a way that reveals fresh character data. Thus the arc feels like a static mood portrait rather than an earned renunciation or change.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric “Charged Poise”: stories begin to hum and she smiles, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulated texture (repetitive cadence of “as she…” clauses) teaches an incantatory pattern, but the lens is over-reliant on lyrical summary; no concrete beat shows causal linkage between mapping geometry and the awakening. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early and hold, but the midpoint remains suspended in reflective loops that flatten pressure. The ending satisfies the lyric CR test yet would be stronger with one visible micro-cost (e.g., scarf dims, page tears, she staggers).</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library is evoked with compact sensory triangulation—glow of lamps, scent of sandalwood, faint tang—filtered through the librarian’s selective attention to resonance rather than cataloguing. Hyperbolic geometry remains abstract (no diagram, compass, or tactile tool) so the environment never physically constrains her body or choice. Spatial choreography is minimal: she “moves with deliberate slowness,” patrons remain a blurred backdrop; bodies never collide or jostle shelves, keeping the stage safe but low-pressure. Closing image of scarf shimmer re-uses the object as micro-setting cue, earning partial charge-gate for 9+.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken dormant analog memories—is declared early but never tested by opposition; nothing fights back, no resource dwindles, no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is entirely lyric accumulation: whispers “grow louder,” scarf “shimmers,” hum “resonates,” yet these are intensifiers without causal reversals or tactical trade-offs. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the single cadence shift suffices, but the absence of visible price keeps the tension intellectual rather than visceral. High-band entry requires a concrete forfeiture (time running out, scarf unravelling, a patron interference) that never arrives.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: memory/story as living entity that must be tended, not consumed. Subtext resides in the librarian’s secrecy—she works “not to assist” patrons—and in the gradual personification of the library itself (shadows, whispers, breathing). No character articulates a thesis; the final smile lets the reader infer the worth of invisible labor. Ambiguity is meaningful: we sense stories are awake yet remain unseen, avoiding moralizing.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains steady psychic distance and perceptual signature: numbers, equations, resonance metaphors feel native to a science-poet librarian. Syntax favors participle openers and anaphoric “as she…” chains that create incantatory rhythm; occasional scaffold loops (“the librarian… the librarian…”) are mild. No dialogue means no voice convergence issues. Register stays within her plausible diction; even “hyperbolic geometry” feels like her natural shorthand, not authorial showing-off.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
    <comment>Paragraph rhythm breathes with white space, but sentence openings repeat “As she…/The librarian…” enough to create template cadence. Figurative layering (“branches of an ancient, gnarled tree”) is restrained, yet mixed metaphors sneak in—scarf glows, then “shimmers as if alive” without clarifying whether light or fabric animates. Information density is moderate: many sentences do only one job (description or summary) rather than double duty. No typos or grammar slips, but the over-reliance on gerundive openers flattens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian's interior life is rendered through luminous impressionistic detail (“luminous absence that filled the pre-dawn hours”) rather than contradiction or embodied conflict; the stance is steady wonder rather than a crucible of clashing impulses, so the renunciation/choice cost required for 9+ remains poetic rather than dramatized on the body. Palette and camera act as extensions of self, fulfilling the micro-choice brief, yet the emotional plateau never fractures under pressure, keeping the arc within high-band but sub-exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The locksmith’s “curiosity and determination” are named but never tested or contradicted; interiority stays generic (“mind racing,” “motivation that burned”). No embodied emotion or micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The act of freeing the lock of hair is smooth, cost-free, and therefore no change or endurance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Emilia’s chronically-curious folklorist drive is repeatedly shown through tactile action (wading, scanning, coaxing the mushroom) and embodied reaction (“intoxicating” decay). Interior contradiction is hinted—excitement vs. trepidation—but never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that costs her something *now*. The ending’s resolve is declared, not dramatized, so the arc feels anticipatory rather than earned. Still, the voice-specific noticing keeps her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archivist’s sorrow-laden gaze and backwards-walking tic are vivid, but the interiority stays atmospheric (“seemed to hold a world of sorrow”) rather than concrete. The mentoring motive is declared, never tested by a moment of interpersonal friction or failure, so the promised “quiet guidance” remains abstract. No visible cost or contradiction surfaces in their micro-choices; tension relaxes into lyric observation rather than character-driven stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Aria is sketched in soft-focus: “wise,” “insatiably creative,” “reverent” are asserted, never embodied. No contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure appears; she prunes, plants, sings, and exits without error or cost. The heirloom seed is the only externalized trait, but it acts for her. Interiority is generic uplift (“heart filled with peace”) rather than particular thought. Closure is pure affirmation, so no earned renunciation or flaw is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward generic metaphysical labels (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her only micro-choice—keep unpicking—never tightens or risks anything tangible; the same beat repeats until spirits vanish without testing her stance. The earned cost is diffuse silence, not a foreclosed path. Voice stays consistent, yet character remains a mood-vehicle more than a knot of conflicting motives.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “methodically curious” label is shown—she pores over silent footage—but no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure appears; the interior is competent, not crucible-forced. The ending’s peaceful stasis feels bestowed by setting rather than paid for by a visible, costly renunciation. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship bullets are N/A. The characterization is solid but not taut enough for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s “quietly analytic” bent is shown through tactile net-unpicking and note-taking that literally changes what he can know, giving credible interiority. The moment he reads the knotted message, his hunger for meaning collides with the salt-sting in his eyes—body and motive fuse. Yet the promised confrontation with “death” stays abstract; no micro-choice pits survival against curiosity, so the crucible never ignites. Still, the final image of transformed vision sells a modest renunciation that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The balladeer’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the fear of vanishing into the code—never lands as a visible micro-choice; her final “tinkersong wonder” is declared, not embodied. The flower press bolt plate is handled early and again at exit, but its new significance is asserted, not dramatized with a felt cost. Still, her selective attention (mist, ozone, charcoal weight) keeps perception individual and consistent within lyric-situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “warmly inquisitive eyes” and habit of reading ice-crystal light keep her perceptual signature alive—but she never makes a micro-choice that costs her anything; the diary simply yields its secrets, so no path is foreclosed. The emotional arc is all reception, no gamble. The goggles and folded page are handled, yet remain emotionally inert; they never constrain or charge her final stance, so the “earned stasis” feels observed, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract; Lyra’s contradictory impulses stay summarized (“she felt a deep connection”) rather than enacted in a single moment of embodied choice. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path—the telescope is raised once, but no tactic or risk is altered. Earned stasis is gestured at but not dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The artist’s face-blindness is never embodied; instead we’re told they “discern hidden patterns.” The renunciation – leaving the library with the coin as talisman – is earned, but the interior contradiction (noble vs. quixotic) is announced rather than dramatized in a single beat. Micro-choices are present (opening the safe, pocketing the coin) yet carry no visible trade-off under the ticking clock. Still, the occupation-specific perceptual lens is consistently rendered and the final stance costs the artist the sanctuary itself.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    Eli’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a risky choice; the decoding happens off-stage and the final “ready to set course” is still only intention. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to the discovery, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; “quiet resolve,” “eyes seemed to absorb,” and “felt a deep connection” state emotion more than embody it. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the climactic renunciation reads as tranquil rather than costly. The craft-want is declared early and reiterated, yet the only micro-choice—uncapping the lock—does not force a visible trade-off or error. Competence dominates struggle, so the arc feels smooth, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria’s altruism is asserted, never tested; she drifts above the settlers like a gentle narrator, never forced to choose between competing goods. Lyra is a silhouette who “created” a garden; the settlers remain a chorus without individual stakes. No one pays a felt cost, so the communal “transformation” lands as abstract uplift rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    The adjuster’s interior contradiction—tender caretaker of cosmic gears yet privately bruised—glows through embodied awe and trembling fingers. Micro-choices (kissing the cracked puppet, slowing to match dusk’s breath) reveal a hierarchy that prizes fragility over self-preservation. The ending’s earned renunciation—accepting perpetual vigilance—pays the cost foreshadowed by the porcelain flaws. Voice remains singular, never lapsing into diagnostic speak, though the lone figure limits relationship crucible testing.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is serviceable: “weight…settling heavy” gives a body cue, and the nut moment is concrete. Yet contradictions are soft—she is “reluctant” but never hesitates once the blueprint appears; risk is absent. No visible flaw complicates her success, so the arc feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maria’s grief and scientific curiosity are sketched, but interiority stays generic (“loosened grief” is abstract). No contradictory impulses play out in scene; the moment of insight reads as declarative epiphany rather than embodied choice. The “need to atone” is stated, yet never tested by an on-page decision that costs her anything tangible. She remains an observer of foam and chrysalis rather than an agent whose values hierarchy is forced to shift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ember’s interiority is consistently lyrical (“mindfully scattered”), but her final shift from idle curiosity to “deep sense of purpose” is asserted rather than embodied; no micro-choice dramatizes the cost of this new stance. The bottled moonlight triggers calm, yet she never risks violating the vendor creed—so the potential internal conflict evaporates untested. Because no contradictory impulse is acted upon, the “earned” realization feels pre-paid by atmosphere, not by stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s gift and healing motive are vivid, but the “sandpaper rough memories” drive stays abstract—no concrete moment where her palette rejects or distorts a dish under memory-load. The interiority loops in place (“turmoil in her mind” repeated) rather than crystallizing a contradictory impulse. Her final stance is a quiet Earned Stasis, yet the cost (what she forfeits or can never taste again) is never specified on-page, blunting the arc’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s “empathetically decisive” trait is announced but never tested under pressure; she faces no internal contradiction or trade-off, so the label stays decorative. The grain-elevator dialogue, while poetic, is an external monologue rather than a crucible that forces her to reveal or reorder values. No micro-choice carries a visible cost, so the arc remains static—more mood portrait than character drama.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “helix-minded” label is never dramatized—no visible contradiction, tool-use, or failure that would let us feel the trait. Her motivation is declared (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) but never tested by a competing want; the only micro-choice is to keep reassembling mirror fragments, which never risks anything tangible. Interiority drifts into theme-speak (“she knew she was…”) instead of embodied perception. Internal conflict is absent; nothing she does threatens her self-concept or forecloses an alternative path, so the ending stasis feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The archivist’s curiosity is clear, but her interiority stays generic: “spark of curiosity and determination” is label-speak, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; she simply follows the map the doodle provides. The ending’s “weight of discovery” is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels abstract rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sculptor’s interiority is vivid—“symphonically minded” filters every perception—but the contradiction between wanting to heal silence and accepting that “years might pass” before return is only asserted, not dramatized with visible cost on this page. No micro-choice in the final beat forecloses an option; the exit is graceful but emotionally static, so the arc falls just short of earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract—“hopeful melancholy,” “sense of purpose”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that costs him anything tangible. The only concrete action is rising from the bench; everything else is summary of mood. Motivation is declared (“discover beauty in the difficult”) yet never tested by an on-page dilemma. The result is a static portrait rather than a character whose precise mind is forced to operate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s pacifism is asserted rather than tested; no external pressure forces her to choose non-violence, so the trait stays ornamental. Interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis—“she felt a deep connection,” “heart swelled with purpose”—without embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to open the diary is gentle but carries no visible cost, so the beat feels low-stakes. The ending’s “earned stasis” is present thematically, yet the prior causality is too thin to make the renunciation feel paid-for.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lush but drifts toward poetic self-label (“sense of serenity wash over her”) that softens contradiction. No second character on page, so status/relationship crucible unused. Final “peace” is asserted, not embodied—no visible cost foreclosing an alternate path. Competence swamps struggle; seed care reads effortless genius rather than flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s curiosity and competence are sketched efficiently, but her interiority stays surface-level; the broken-arrow keepsake is the only concrete reveal of deeper self. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—she simply observes, flies, and deduces. The final awe feels told (“sense of wonder and awe”) rather than embodied through tremor, breath, or risk. Micro-choices are present but low-cost; the mission succeeds without her paying a visible price or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is present but generic (“shiver run down her spine,” “hazy precision of her thoughts”); no contradictory impulses shown in scene. Only one micro-choice—starting the survey—yet it alters nothing and carries no visible cost. The investigator’s obsession is declared, never tested; she remains static from entry to exit. No flaw complicates her path; foresight goal is announced, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s synesthetic gift and vocation are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“certify wonder as essential”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the song crescendos because the prompt says so, not because prior beats foreclose alternatives. The ending smile signals satisfaction without visible cost or renunciation, keeping the arc aspirational rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper’s urge “to harvest insights from failure” is stated but never dramatized through a concrete failure or micro-choice; interiority drifts into lyric self-summary (“crushing doubts”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The flute-playing beat is atmospheric, not a decision that costs her anything, so the change is felt as mood, not earned character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Echo’s obsession with “the mathematics of emotion” is compelling, but the borrowing-personalities trait is asserted, not dramatized: we watch Echo “slip into skins” in summary, never see a beat where a borrowed mask forces a wrong micro-choice or costs credibility. No interior contradiction within the workshop scene; obsession remains monolithic. Closure image is evocative (the whisper), yet the cost of vanishing stars is external, not tied to Echo’s body, wallet, or relationships—felt price is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Eira’s “jittery” trait is announced but never embodied in action or interiority; the pendant does the calming for her, so her flaw never complicates choice. The moment with the aurora-woman is beautifully atmospheric yet passive—no decision, risk, or refusal is asked of her, so no cost is legible. Interior contradiction and micro-choices are absent; the character is more lens than agent, limiting the score to mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mystic’s interiority is lyrically textured but remains performative (“truth she sought,” “soul and revealed”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values; the prism stays a prop, not a decision-maker. The ending’s “charged poise” is asserted, not dramatized—no visible cost or path foreclosed. Character reads as atmospheric role, not individual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the spinner’s contradictory stillness-vs-motion impulse is embodied in the loom/puzzle parallel. Motivation is legible—silence must be re-spun into connection—yet the “latent sacrifice” is gestured at, not dramatized with visible forfeit. Micro-choices are present (threading, fitting puzzle pieces) but do not tighten under rising external pressure; cost is poetic, not material. Voice remains singular; no relationship crucible on page, so status tests are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The blacksmith’s quiet determination is shown through embodied action—hammering, wrapping silk, exploring mines—but interior contradiction is thin; no moment where meekness actually costs him or forces a visible trade-off. The arrival of the apprentice is a label-shift rather than a crucible; we don’t see how his “meek” stance must change or endure a price. Closure is a forward-looking handshake, not an earned renunciation or decision that forecloses a path, so the character arc feels suspended rather than resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The map-maker’s curiosity is vivid early, but once the shard activates she becomes a passive tourist through kaleidoscopic worlds; no micro-choice alters the itinerary and her interiority turns repetitive (“she felt… she knew… she sensed…”). The withheld-truth motive is declared, never tested by a risky decision; the ending’s clarity lands as gift, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    Skipper’s reticence is shown through gesture and silence, but his interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“luminescent ache”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The sea-glass pocketing and stone-stacking are concrete micro-choices, yet no real trade-off or visible cost is exacted; the resolve to “protect” the lighthouse repeats the opening stance. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The herald’s interiority is lyrically consistent—“shadowed elation,” “joy that was both dark and luminous”—but her motives remain abstract: steering dawn is a poetic assignment without tangible cost or contradiction on the page; no micro-choice risks failure or forfeiture, so the arc feels performed rather than compelled. Embodied emotion is present yet monotonic; the same awe-laughter registers at base, summit, and descent, flattening pressure. The glass lantern ritual is repeated but never surprises her or us; competence dominates, struggle is absent. Earned stasis is hinted—“she knew that her work was just beginning”—yet the price of endless return is asserted, not dramatized, keeping the closure luminous but weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kaito’s curiosity about “story-magnet” people is stated, not dramatized; the wing’s handling is delicate but never forces a hard choice or visible cost. Interiority drifts into abstract wonder (“his understanding expanding”) instead of contradictory impulse under pressure. The earned moment is a soft realization without a renunciation or tactic change—acceptable at this length, but the lack of micro-choice keeps him just shy of 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.4)
    The worker’s interiority is lyrically asserted (“steady hum in the background of their mind”) rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in scene. Actions (climb, hold, close eyes) are ritualized rather than pressured; the final smile feels unearned because no flaw or mistake has complicated the task. The “quantified sorrow” premise is announced, but the worker’s own sorrow is never tested or traded off; thus the renunciation lacks visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.2)
    Memory-keeper’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. She “feels drawn,” “hums,” “continues” without stakes-based decision or visible flaw. Final resolve is restated, not earned by a costly on-page act.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elys’s interiority is concrete—empathic resonance with books, the armchair ritual, the invitation rubbed soft—and the contradiction “staying while leaving” is lived in scene. Yet the mistake that drove them here is kept abstract; we never see the wound, only the label “painful,” so the renunciation at the end lacks a felt before/after. The paradox motif circles back via the dropped note, earning a quiet stasis, but the cost is generic “peace” rather than a specific path foreclosed. Voice stays consistent; still, the arc rides atmosphere more than pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “creeping normality noticer” is interiorized through lyrical noticing, but her want remains abstract (“searching for a way to connect”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the single micro-choice—accepting bread/tea—does not tighten under rising pressure, so the arc is more mood-glide than earned renunciation. Cost is ambient, not personal or scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested under pressure; she never mis-catalogues, drops the slide, or chooses precision over urgency. Interiority floats in lyrical abstraction (“thrill of excitement,” “sense of wonder”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that costs her anything. The closure is a serene exit, not an earned renunciation, so the trait feels decorative rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s motives—recover the fob, shield her father’s trade—stay coherent, but her interiority drifts into generic “determination” labels; the climactic stare-down with The Shadow is more posture than embodied choice, so the cost feels asserted rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.7)
    Aria’s interiority is mostly atmospheric mood – “luminous skeptic” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory action.  The single micro-choice, lifting the vibrating ring and walking toward the stranger, is too late and too slight to carry the required “felt cost” of closure; the stance change is declared, not embodied.  Because no second character exerts immediate pressure, relationship/status crucible is absent, leaving the internal arc a smooth glide rather than a crucible.  Grandfather memories function as decorative backstory; they never tilt her present choice or create a blind-spot that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“jumbled mess of forgotten lines,” charcoal-stained fingers—but the moment of breakthrough is narrated rather than dramatized; we watch her “feel the weight…begin to lift” instead of seeing a micro-choice that costs her something concrete. The memory-gift is asserted, never weaponized or tripped over in-scene. Still, her sensory recall and embodied sorrow keep her above the midline.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s interiority is vivid—her obsession with “lost conversations” is embodied in trembling hands and ink that literally wilts at lies. Yet the arc slides from curiosity to artifact-collector; the final chamber reveal feels gifted rather than wrested. No micro-choice visibly costs her ink, stamina, or social credit, so the change reads as epiphany more than earned renunciation. Voice remains coherent and individual, but the absence of a pressure-forced trade-off caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.4)
    Aria is sketched only by vocational label and serene acceptance; no interior contradiction or embodied cost accompanies her decision to embed the fragment. The “muted vigor” of the bluff folk remains an abstraction—no individual choices or stakes appear on the page—so the collective reaction feels decorative rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s caretaker-robot paradox—precision vs. emotional overload—stays legible, but her “inner static” is mostly labeled, not dramatized; the carved box is touched twice yet never opened or risked, so the fear stays abstract. The burn-plan epiphany jumps too cleanly from duty to escape without an on-page micro-choice that shows cost. Still, her body-level tending of roses and the tentative smile at the end earn a modest arc of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s interiority is thin; the “discerning curator” label never alters her micro-choices in-scene. She watches and asks, but no contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her actions; the decision to display the locket feels like a default rather than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s calm-defiance motive is declared repeatedly but never tested by an opposing force; the dice and journal are handled, yet no contradictory impulse forces her to risk anything, so the “earned” quality feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lantern lighter’s curiosity about deleted memories is declared early but never tested under pressure; the only micro-choice—touching the crystal—feels externally compelled, not driven by an interior contradiction we have watched build. Embodied emotion is limited to “sense of trepidation,” a label that flattens the pivotal beat. The pressed flowers reappear at the end, but their link to recovered memories is asserted, not dramatized through action or sensory flash; thus the arc is more associative than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The summoner is sketched only in atmospheric silhouette—patient, calm, isolated—without contradictory impulse or visible flaw that could complicate the ritual. Interiority stays generic (“their thoughts turned…they felt an overwhelming need”) and is never tested against an external antagonist or ally, so pressure stays flat. The only micro-choice—releasing the paper crane—confirms rather than challenges the established persona, so no path is foreclosed with cost. Because the character’s motive never sharpens into a palpable dilemma, the ending’s calm feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Tutor’s gently probing patience is consistent, but the student’s interiority stays generic (“eyes sparkled,” “shiver run down spine”), never showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices are mostly tea-sipping and seal-handling without visible trade-offs; the final gift feels tender yet pre-ordained rather than earned through costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra’s skepticism is asserted (“charmed skeptic”) but never dramatized—she instantly obeys the shell without testing or doubt. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“inexplicable connection,” “profound longing”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final resolve is declared, not earned by micro-choices we can trace. No visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Character is competent but never contradictory; interiority drifts into label-speak (“felt a sense of pride and accomplishment”) that blurs embodied cost. The heritage rose thorn and the key are handled, yet neither triggers a visible micro-choice that tightens stakes. Calibrated treason stays thematic; no moment shows her hesitating, risking, or sacrificing for the forgery. The ending’s peace arrives as declared, not dramatized, so the renunciation lacks palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but her “quest to learn why some people echo” is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page is forced by that want, so the motive never tightens under pressure. The shell’s warming is felt, yet she never acts differently because of it—observed sensation without consequential decision. The ending’s “she would return” is a plan, not a renunciation or cost, so the arc accumulates atmosphere rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    Aria’s interiority is atmospheric but vague; “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” remains a label never enacted—no diving gear, no ghost bargain, no error under pressure. The sole micro-choice—touching the globe—triggers vision rather than decision; she watches, never risking change. Motive (“salvage something pure”) is stated repeatedly yet never collides with a visible trade-off; the absence of earned cost or contradictory impulse keeps her flat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority drifts into abstract reverie; the protagonist “feels a sense of unity” and “heart swelled with gratitude” without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that tests her. The net-mender identity is asserted but never shows her mending or risking a net under pressure; occupation remains label. No visible cost or renunciation charges the final beat—she simply walks home unchanged. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s “sharply observant” trait and truth-drive are asserted repeatedly but never put to a decisive test; she follows paper scraps without error or cost, so the promised flaw-and-struggle arc never materializes. Interiority stays generic (“mind racing,” “heart pounding”) rather than concrete and contradictory. The final awe is declared, not dramatized through body or choice. No relationship or secondary pressure is on-page, so the crucible is purely environmental and therefore thinner.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The visionary is only a static observer; her single “micro-choice” is to keep listening. No inner contradiction or embodied emotion is dramatized—only summary labels (“lost in thought,” “sense of calm”). The promised “guiding force” never materializes on-page; she remains a lens, not an agent. The absence of any paid cost or foreclosed path keeps the arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid—embodied wine-hangover eyes, creaking joints—but his contradictory impulses (preserve vs. create) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single moment of choice. The “gleaned redemption” feels conferred by nostalgic sound-jar rather than earned through a visible forfeiture; the final smile lands as emotional summary, not costly renunciation. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    Azure Coat’s interiority is lyrically consistent yet leans on abstract labels (“logically emotional mind,” “deep sense of purpose”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the embodied micro-choices under pressure are present but muffled inside lush atmospheric summary, so the final stance feels anticipated rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.4)
    The mapper’s only “choice” is to raise her hands at the viaduct—an unmotivated ritual that carries no visible cost or contradiction. Interiority stays generic (“surge of determination,” “sense of purpose”) and never degrades under pressure; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values. The promised flaw—impatience—is asserted, never dramatized; the final stance feels identical to the opening one, so no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s calm is stated repeatedly but never tested; no contradiction or visible cost attaches to it. The “break free” motive is declared late and never dramatized—no micro-choice shows her refusing an old pattern. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she felt liberation”) rather than embodied tension. The lantern connection is asserted, not enacted; we never see her hand shake or grip tighten under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chaplain’s guilt is named but never embodied in present-tense contradiction; his single “micro-choice” is to accept a music box, an action with no visible cost or risk. Interiority drifts into sententious abstracts (“turn apologies into action”) that tell us the moral hierarchy instead of dramatizing it. Because the wronged inmate never appears as live pressure, the chaplain’s change feels self-forgiveness rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    Zephyr’s “curiosity” is asserted repeatedly but never complicates her path; she observes, decodes, and succeeds without contradiction or cost. No interior resistance, physical limit, or trade-off ever threatens her goal, so the final ringing feels predetermined rather than earned. The arrow tip and kaleidoscope function as thematic props, but neither triggers a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid (“haunting sense of absence”) and her obsession is embodied in repeated night-time archive dives. The final realization—that files were merely archived, not erased—gives her a credible micro-renunciation, but the cost feels abstract rather than lived; no tool, relationship, or body-limit is forfeited, so the change lands as intellectual, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive nature is shown through her micro-choices—spotting the fragment, deciding to trust the mirrors—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction is light; she never doubts her empathic map, so the arc is flat. Still, her embodied perception of the orchard ice and crystal pulse keeps emotion physical. Earned stasis is credible: she accepts guardianship again, crystal against heart, cost felt in the slowing floes. 7.4 not 8+ because no genuine flaw complicates her; she is anomaly but not error.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The euthanasia-tourist backstory supplies a sharp contradiction—someone who sought death now laboring to clear wreckage—but interiority leans on stock phrases (“sense of detachment,” “haunting me”) and abstract self-diagnosis. Micro-choices are sparse; the pivot from passive observer to shovel-wielding volunteer is declared rather than dramatized with felt cost. The heirloom parasol is gripped but never exerts causal pressure; its lace patterns remain decorative. Earned stasis is hinted at yet the on-page price (cold-blistered hands, social awkwardness with volunteers) is muted, keeping the change more announced than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    The sentinel’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains observational; no micro-choice under pressure alters her course. The burned fragment never becomes a prop that forces a visible trade-off, so the arc stays static. She “realizes” and “feels,” yet the page does not show a decision or renunciation that costs her anything. The result is a luminous sensibility rather than a tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The line-walker’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at a single emotional register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the “strangely honest” label feels asserted rather than tested. The prophet functions as a wisdom vending machine, offering no resistance that could force the walker to reveal flaw or recalibrate motive. The closing “sense of peace” is therefore unearned—no visible cost is paid for the consecration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Luna’s “perceptively calm” trait is named repeatedly but never tested; she never mis-reads a clue, hesitates, or pays a price for her calm. No contradictory impulse or micro-choice reveals interior tension, so the portrait stays flat. The “collective healing” motive is asserted, not dramatized—no moment shows her refusing an easier path or risking failure. Earned stasis is absent; the ending serenity feels pre-ordained, not purchased.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich—“eyes… red-rimmed from lack of sleep,” ink-stained fingers drumming—but the scholar’s contradictory impulses are reported rather than enacted in scene; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized before the summons. The final resolve is credible yet abstract, cost hinted but not viscerally felt. Voice is specific; motivation remains steady; meets default scope.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness is stated but never dramatized as an on-page constraint; she acts with unbroken purpose, chalk and driftwood choices reading as calm ritual rather than struggle. Interiority drifts into atmospheric abstraction (“tidal longing,” “echoes of memories past”) instead of conflicting impulses realized in gesture. The final peace feels declared, not earned by visible renunciation or loss; no path is foreclosed with cost. Chalk and driftwood function as atmospheric props, never altering her tactical options or risking failure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    Eli’s interiority is poetic but generic; no contradictory impulses play out in real time. The “luminous ache” is asserted, not embodied. His choices—repair, reinforce, gaze—are sequential tasks, not stakes-driven decisions. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s serene-therapist persona stays consistent, but the “decisively kind” trait is asserted rather than tested; no contradictory impulse or visible cost ever challenges her, so the interiority feels flat. Emma is sketched only as “frail yet determined,” a stock polarity that never complicates under pressure. The micro-choice to hum the mundane is present, yet it reads as technique, not crucible—swappable with any other soothing act. Because no flaw or status shift is risked, the characterization plateau stays safely below the 7+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lyra’s “quietly deliberate” nature is stated repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma; the interiority stays abstract (“insatiable curiosity,” “wonder and awe”) and the only micro-choice is to resume work. Cost is asserted, not dramatized; she never hesitates, sacrifices, or errs, so traits remain labels rather than lived limits.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic (“shaken to her core,” “yearn for the stars”); no contradictory impulse is dramatized.  The tooth triggers only awe, never doubt that could test her skepticism.  Mentor memory is a summary label; no micro-choice shows bone-setting craft altering her stance.  Closure is an declared epiphany, not an earned renunciation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    The star watcher’s interiority is lyrically sustained but largely static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the final “stillness” feels pre-decided rather than earned. Micro-choices (polishing strokes) recur but never tilt present risk or foreclose an alternative path. The absence of any second character keeps pressure purely spectral; status and relationship crucibles are inapplicable. Still, the sustained perceptual signature keeps the portrait above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s “quietly proactive” trait is asserted but never dramatized in a way that costs her anything; the flower acceptance is passive. Interiority drifts into generic healing language (“raw edges,” “slowly unfolding peace”) rather than embodied contradiction. The amber pendant is touched twice but never complicates her choice—no tension between clinging and letting go—so the change feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The novelist’s interior contradiction—writer’s block vs. the tug of mystery—is stated early and embodied in her fixation on the shell; her micro-choice to pick it up tilts her stance. Yet the ghost-cameo supplies the decisive push rather than a painful self-reckoning; the cost is diffuse, not legible on her body or future. The “against the current” metaphor is repeated but never complicates her tactics; hence the arc feels tidy, not genuinely flawed. Voice stays coherent, but emotional layering stays safe—no hypocrisy or misbelief that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s inventor-storyteller duality is vivid, yet her interiority stays in lyrical summary (“a deep satisfaction”) rather than contradictory flashes under pressure; no micro-choice visibly costs her anything, so the ending’s communal triumph feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s patience-as-ritual is embodied early and pays off in the blood-drop seal, giving us a credible micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“world…holding its breath” mirrors her own held breath), but the heartbeat-map desire is stated more than dramatized until the final glow; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-process. Earned stasis is present—the life-force cost is felt—yet she never risks failure, so tension stays interior and plateaued.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s quiet obsession with “storing wonder in the cellar of reason” is an embodied, character-specific engine that keeps him tinkering past exhaustion; the contradiction between wonder and cataloguing surfaces in micro-choices (he pauses to note crystal angles instead of fleeing the rotting-air cavern). No exterior crucible or status shift appears—this is solo-interior territory—so relationship bullets are N/A. The final smile and shared heartbeat with the clockwork show a credible, scaled renunciation: he accepts that mystery will remain larger than any filing system, paying the cost of permanent incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The weaver’s interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“boundary-lessly trapped”) that tells rather than embodies conflict; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. Her only micro-choice—beginning to weave—lacks visible cost or risk, so the perceived deepening feels pre-ordained. The kerosene lamp and loom function as props, but neither state-change nor flaw complicates tactics. The final stance is serene acceptance, yet the price is asserted, not dramatized; Earned Stasis is declared rather than paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is textured—the grain of ash wood as grief-map—but contradiction is only lightly sketched; widow’s “here and gone” ache is embodied yet never risks a micro-choice that could fail. Carving ritual dominates action; no secondary pressure or status clash enters, so stakes stay internal and static. End renunciation (setting tool down) is credible but cost is muted—no path foreclosed on page beyond the quiet finish. Voice particularity strong; motivation plateaued.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scavenger’s contradictory impulses—collecting fragments vs. surrendering to stillness—are alive in the final shutter-click, but the camera wheel rather than the body drives the decisive beat; interiority is vivid yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied, keeping the renunciation just shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s curiosity and engineer mindset are sketched early, but internal contradiction is only asserted (“equations for hope” vs. abandonment) never dramatized. No micro-choice shows her creativity functioning under pressure; the pipe rerouting is reported, not struggled through. The sextant piece never alters her decisions on-page, so motivation stays ornamental. Cost is gestured at (“she would always carry the lessons”) but not paid in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is soft-focused and lyric; the bear is granted near-human motive-telepathy (“seemingly sensing Elian’s introspection”) without dramatized cue. Reflection block ~30% meets BRR exception but flattens present pressure; no contradictory impulse plays out in scene—dream simply re-ignites. Cost is asserted (“not too late”) rather than embodied; renunciation or trade-off absent. Micro-choice hierarchy visible only in silent stillness, but excruciating gentleness never tested against a visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but her “desire to understand the architecture of lies” is asserted more than dramatized; the sundial’s sudden gift of self-knowledge feels bestowed rather than earned through visible contradiction or loss. No micro-choice under pressure shows her abandoning or paying for that goal; the moment of clarity is narrated, not embodied. The closure is poetically satisfying, yet the character’s arc leans on thematic declaration rather than a visible forfeiture or stance-change that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    The collector’s “infinitely patient” trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested; she decodes knots without obstacle, contradiction, or visible cost. Interiority defaults to lyrical abstraction (“deep sense of connection”) rather than concrete, idiosyncratic thought. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; the rope puzzle solves itself. The closure is a quiet re-winding, not an earned renunciation or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lush and consistent—melancholy, morbid, archivist-observer—but the only micro-choice (touching the loose thread) is static; no consequence or higher-stakes fork is forced. The “obituary for the living” premise stays observational rather than tactical, so motivation never tightens. End state is wistful stasis, not renunciation with visible cost. No second character, so relationship/status tests N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prince’s longing is lyrically voiced but never embodied in a concrete, costly choice; he “assembles” and “hypothesizes” in summary, so we watch no contradictory impulse collide under pressure. The final beat is pure epiphany (“eyes shone with tears”) rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Interiority drifts into stock phrases—“pang of sorrow,” “bitterly sweet nostalgia”—that tell us the emotion we should feel. Because motivation never tightens into a visible, irreversible act, the arc stays observational, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s interiority is mostly generic “therapy-speak” (“prove that scars can sing,” “emotional ones that still linger”) and never embodied in a specific contradiction during action; the graft is the only micro-choice tied to motive, but it carries no visible cost or risk, so the arc stays flat. Motivation is declared rather than dramatized; the radio call, the coin, and the sand are handled as talismans without forcing a trade-off. No genuine flaw complicates her tactics; competence is unchallenged, so the ending feels pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s “luminous skeptic” and “realistically imaginative” labels sit atop repeated interior summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the only embodied choice—lifting the box lid—arrives without visible cost or micro-struggle. The vow to become “guardian” is declared, not tested, so the required Earned Stasis reads as unearned promise. Interiority drifts into atmospheric cliché (“her heart swelled”) instead of idiosyncratic perception under pressure. Voice remains consistent, but the arc is observation-heavy; no flaw complicates the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sentimentalist’s “gentle, loving touch” goal is stated early and the final image of vanishing into the nebula keeps the renunciation legible, so the arc clears the low-bar closure. Yet we never see a concrete micro-choice that risks or costs anything on-page; interiority floats in cosmic paraphrase rather than contradictory impulse, so the emotional cost is assumed, not felt. The gear is never used, only held, so object-based pressure is absent. Motivation is coherent but not dramatized under pressure; stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the carver’s “turmoil within” is named, not embodied. No micro-choice is dramatized between chiseling and the spectral arrival; grief-study becomes retrospective lecture. The mentor’s nod is the only external pressure, so the final insight feels bestowed, not earned. Ribbon and poem function as talismans rather than decision-forcing objects.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her guilt is embodied in the rake-handle inscription moment—but the “ethically diligent” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, so the arc feels smoothed rather than tested. The micro-choice to walk on is credible yet low-cost; the story never risks her competence or makes her choose between two live duties. Closure leans on lyrical reprise rather than a visible forfeiture, so the change feels symbolic, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    Interiority is evocative (“velveteen gloom,” “tender touch”) but remains filtered through lyrical summary rather than contradictory impulse in scene; no moment of irreversible choice is dramatized with visible cost, so the arc stays observational. The gardener’s obsession is stated repeatedly, yet the single micro-action—unthreading tapestry—is too gentle to register as stakes-bearing. Motivation is coherent but never pressure-tested; we are told the quest “consumed every waking moment” instead of watching it erode a concrete alternative. Earned stasis is hinted at in the final return to the silo, yet the cost is poetic rather than embodied, keeping characterization just below the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cartographer’s desire to “seed innovation within constraint” is declared repeatedly but never dramatized through a concrete micro-choice; the kingfisher quill is handled but does not force a visible trade-off or error. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“groundedly imaginative intensity”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending’s “smile” signals completion yet no new tactic is foreclosed, so the arc feels static—more meditation than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.3)
    Emilia’s interiority is evocative but remains abstract: “diligent orchestra copyist” is never exercised in scene—no ink, no proofing, no conductor score, no muscle memory of transcription. Motivation (“teach dust to tell stories”) recurs as mantra yet is not dramatised through contradictory micro-choices; the only visible decision is transcribing, which merely confirms competence. Static posture at the desk throughout prevents status shifts or embodied cost; the cloak grab is reactive, not a value-laden choice that forecloses a path. No earned contradiction or visible price attaches to the obsession, so the closure is felt as mood rather than character change.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s interiority is evocative but remains observational; the scattering act is reverent yet lacks a visible cost that alters her stance. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the “earned” beat feels asserted rather than lived. The Eli exchange supplies status tilt, yet both voices converge toward the same gentle philosophy, flattening distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s “wannabe philosopher” tag is shown more than told—he pores over tattered texts, digs until his hands blister, and keeps the cog like a relic—but the interiority leans on stock abstractions (“competing narratives,” “hubris and consequence”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. No second character appears, so status crucible is off the table; the sole pressure is self-imposed obsession. The arc is Earned Stasis—he renounces the surface world with a “wry smile” in the sewer—yet the cost is asserted (“he would never be content”) rather than dramatized. Contradictory impulses are declared, not enacted in scene, keeping the portrait vivid but not fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “expectantly resigned” is stated, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply proceeds with her plan. The rosette triggers nostalgia, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals fresh conflict or cost. Closure is a static affirmation rather than an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s memory-tasting gift is shown in action—she cooks, tastes, and the past blooms—so we feel the trait as lived. Interior desire (“create something beautiful from the ruins”) remains coherent, but no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; choices feel single-note rather than torn. The moment she plants the seed is tender, yet it never costs her anything or forces adaptation; gentle rebellion never becomes painful trade-off. Closure earns quiet hope, but the absence of visible forfeiture keeps the arc shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The toll-keeper’s involuntary honesty is stated, not dramatized; no moment shows them forced to speak an inconvenient truth under pressure. The woman’s motivation is thin—she pays, states her goal, then becomes a passive observer. Their joint ascent produces no conflicting micro-choices that cost either anything, so the final “preserve wonder” line feels tagged on rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eli’s “creeping normality” gift is shown only as passive noticing; she never makes a high-stakes choice that costs her anything. The orris root is clutched but never used in a beat that changes her tactics. Interiority drifts into abstractions (“inexplicable connection,” “quiet wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final insight feels bestowed, not earned by prior mistakes or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    The statue’s interiority is abstract—“incisively kind,” “sense of wonder”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; it listens, understands, and shares, but never risks or loses anything. The parrotfish functions as a gentle informant, not a crucible, so the statue’s shift from certainty to nuance is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost. No persistent flaw or blind spot complicates its telepathic mastery, so the arc feels smooth but frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    The “grim optimist” persona is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice that costs him something; the dice are fondled, yet no actual wager or irreversible bet is hazarded. Interiority stays abstract (“pondered the concept of perpetual motion”) instead of revealing a hierarchy of values under threat. The final smile feels unearned because the story shows no prior beat where optimism is tested and visibly bruised. Thus characterization stays functional but thin, missing the 8+ band where contradictory impulses must act in-scene with felt cost.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the eternal climb and the dice-in-hand crystallize an eternal recurrence without exit, a conceptual repricing of “bound to the infinite staircase.” The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but it is legible in the final image. Causality is thematic rather than event-based (Accumulative/Textural lens); the pattern holds, yet the orientation anchor (“infinite staircase”) is taught early enough to waive the Orientation Test penalty. However, the absence of any concrete beat where the dice or the climb alters tactical options keeps the causality light, capping the score below 7.0.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
    <comment>The staircase itself functions as the dominant “tool-as-setting,” constraining every step and charging the final image; its serpent-like elongation is repeatedly filtered through the narrator’s bodily fatigue, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail (air thickening, shadows snatching clothes) stays tethered to the narrator’s narrowing attention. Spatial choreography is coherent because the only move is upward. While broader world rules are minimal, the micro-setting fulfills the requirement of a recurring object that alters choice and reappears in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Deep interiority anchors the painter’s insomnia and hope; the “methodically hopeful face” is shown, not told. Contradictory impulses—yearning to revive lost languages while fearing the city’s cruelty—co-exist in scene, powering the final creative act. Micro-choices (picking up the brush, dancing it across canvas) crystallize values and cost. Yet the motivation “to prove strangers remember kindness” is stated more than tested; no on-page stranger interaction complicates or jeopardizes her stance, so the flaw feels safe rather than compound.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elena’s desire to preserve culture is declared, not dramatized; she never makes a costly micro-choice under pressure. The interiority is generic curator-speak (“sparkled,” “reveled”) rather than embodied contradiction. No relationship crucible or status shift occurs on-page; she remains a cipher observing symbols. The ending stance is asserted, not earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The clock-maker’s hunger for the arcane is declared but never tested; he never hesitates, fears, or sacrifices. Interiority stays generic (“neatly inventive mind” repeated) rather than showing contradiction under pressure. No cost for claiming the stone or solving the yoyo is dramatized—success feels preordained. The ending assertion that he is “forever changed” is unsupported by any visible loss or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.7)
    Protagonist’s curiosity is stated but never tested by an external dilemma; interiority stays at “morbid curiosity” and “shuddered” without bodily specificity. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—the voice simply obeys the whispering advisor—so the final paralysis feels administered rather than earned. The photographically-cursed vision never confronts the narrator with a live choice, so the arc is observation, not change.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prophet’s desire to “turn obstacles into instruments” is declared repeatedly but never tested by a conflicting want or external resistance; she succeeds without friction, so no contradictory impulse or visible cost emerges. Interiority floats in lyrical abstraction (“restless energy,” “enigmatic smile”) rather than embodied contradiction. The ending’s “vanished into the shadows” leaves her stance unchanged, so no path is foreclosed and no earned stasis arrives. The mallet is handled, yet its worn surface is the only micro-choice we see; the rest is summary of music made off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lyra’s “quietly driven” trait is asserted repeatedly but never instantiated in a concrete, costly micro-choice; she drifts through discovery without contradiction or visible trade-off. Interiority relies on stock labels (“sense of dread,” “weight of the unknown”) rather than embodied, idiosyncratic perception. The reed whistle and map function as props, yet neither forces a decision that reveals hierarchy of values; passivity dominates until the final step, which is undifferentiated from the story’s first impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority is present but generic: “fierce determination,” “sense of satisfaction” tell rather than embody. No contradictory impulses act in-scene; Emilia glides from calm historian to triumphant truth-seeker without visible friction or cost. The profession is label-deep—no archival grit, no tactile encounter with parchment that might contradict her rational creed. Closure is serene, not paid for; the illuminated letter becomes trophy, not tool that challenged her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The surveyor’s motive—"archeologist of abandoned dreams"—is declared repeatedly but never tested by an opposing force or concrete loss; interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction ("hushed blaze") rather than embodied contradiction, so the final smile feels unearned. No micro-choice visibly forecloses a path or exacts on-page cost, keeping the arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s calm indexer persona is consistent, but interiority stays abstract (“felt a deep connection,” “sense of excitement”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The stamp is handled, yet its emotional charge is asserted rather than dramatized through tactile tension. No visible flaw complicates her decryption; competence feels friction-free, so the final resolve lands as temperament, not earned alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaito’s grief is palpable in the lantern-crafting and crane-folding, but interiority slips into abstractions (“luminous torment,” “yearning to transcend”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly raises the stakes after the first crane; the final release feels pre-ordained, not hard-won. The absence of another on-page character keeps status pressure off, so the arc is purely internal—acceptable, but the emotional cost is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    Amira’s shock-to-purpose arc is legible, but interiority defaults to abstract labels (“unfiltered awakening,” “bleak exhilaration”) instead of embodied contradiction. The crystal’s calming effect is asserted, not dramatized through bodily change or micro-choice. No internal conflict is shown in-scene; she pivots from grief to investigative drive between paragraphs without visible friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s perpetual surprise is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; she scans, deduces, inserts, and feels generic “excitement” without visible flaw or cost. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“sense of belonging”) rather than particular perception. The closure beat offers Charged Poise but the emotional reconfiguration is asserted, not dramatized through a prior mistake or visible price. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; solo arc remains competent but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is moody but abstract (“guilt-ridden” named, not embodied); no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The memory-flash from driftwood is the only micro-choice, yet it changes nothing on-page—she still returns to client unchanged. Watch-hand cue has potential but never tests her flaw. Earned cost is missing; closure is a restatement of intent, not a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    The negotiator’s interiority stays abstract—“uncommonly thoughtful expression,” “sense of calm determination”—rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the antique pull is fondled but never alters her next tactic. The ending’s “peace” is asserted, not paid for by a visible forfeiture. Label-only interiority recurs (“weight of responsibility,” “recycle mistakes into wisdom”), keeping her flat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority never rises above “sad man in pretty sentences”; every beat restates the same divorce regret in new metaphors but offers no contradictory impulse or choice. The compass and utility-pole navigation are summarized rather than handled tactically, so we never see Jack make a decision that costs him anything. The final “resolve” is declared, not dramatized. The merrily melancholic tag is stated repeatedly but never complicates an action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lena’s interiority hovers in generalized, therapeutic language (“weight of her past bearing down,” “jaded wonder”) rather than idiosyncratic, body-level perception. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; memory-erasure backstory is told, not dramatized, so the micro-choice that could foreclose a path never arrives. The signed baseball is fondled but never tests or changes her stance; empathy remains an asserted goal, not an earned cost. She exits the scene essentially unchanged, so the required Earned Stasis/Charged Poise is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lyra’s interiority is lyrically consistent—“her feet bare and her hair wild”—but her decision to help Aria is declared, not dramatized under pressure; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. The promised metamorphosis is felt as atmospheric glow rather than a choice that narrows her options or exacts visible cost until the very last image. Emotional states are rendered in abstract fortune-cookie abstractions (“a sense of wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for on-page; the final image is luminous yet cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied—she “felt an inexplicable connection to the fragile, porcelain surface”—but her contradictory impulse (to seek lost time while sitting passively) is stated, not dramatized. Only one micro-choice (unfastening the book) carries visible cost; the rest is reverie. The crack-as-self metaphor is vivid, yet the character’s perplexity never actively obstructs or enables a beat; it remains label-quality. No relationship crucible or status shift on the page; head-count is one, so those bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurora’s pacifism is stated but never pressure-tested; she drifts rather than chooses, so her “steadfast” trait stays abstract. The micro-choice to sew is gentle but not morally freighted, so interior contradiction never ignites. Closure feels serene rather than costly because the locked dimension opens without her having to betray any value. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s “destitute philanthropist” label is asserted, never dramatized—no act of giving or poverty appears on-page. Interiority drifts into cosmic abstractions (“texture of transformation”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices are limited to accepting a bottle; no visible cost or renunciation lands. Closure relies on mood, not character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.3)
    The sentinel is a cipher: no interior contradiction, no embodied emotion beyond “eyes straining,” no micro-choice that costs her anything. The decision to activate the cradle is smooth, instantaneous, and free of visible price; even the moment of recognition (“she realized that the bronze quill holder had been more than just a simple gift”) is told, not dramatized. Calm inventiveness is asserted, never tested under duress. The result is a competent but frictionless placeholder rather than a lived persona.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.7)
    The herder’s motivation is legible—ancestral duty and cosmic curiosity—but remains abstract; no interior contradiction or bodily cost appears. We never feel the curse as a lived burden (no mis-sensing, no physical price). The moment of completion is reported, not dramatized, so the promised shift in stance lacks embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; emotions are named (“furiously tranquil”) rather than embodied in gesture or breath. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—she reads the letter she herself hid, so the moment is circular, not consequential. The “cartography of scars” remains metaphorical; we never see one scar alter her grip on the timer or the envelope. Endurance is declared, not tested, so the renunciation feels cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aurélien’s “dueling philosopher” premise is vivid, but interiority remains generic: “his mind… engaged” tells rather than shows, and the supposed contradiction between diplomatic and fierce never complicates a choice. The mechanical arm is mentioned, yet never alters tactics or carries cost. Emotional states are labeled (“diplomatically fierce demeanor now a palpable force”) instead of embodied. The needle card returns, but its metaphorical weight is asserted, not dramatized, so the final softening feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s interiority is lyric but generic—“molting personalities” is asserted, never shown in scene; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The only micro-choice is entering the library, yet it carries no visible trade-off or cost. Friendship with the prisoner is summarized, not dramatized, so motivation stays abstract. Closure relies on declarative hope rather than earned renunciation or stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    The pianist’s interiority is lyrically voiced, but her motives remain abstract: “surprise fate” is declared, not dramatized. She makes only one micro-choice—entering the film—and the cost is poetic rather than felt. The compasses flicker, yet never force a visible tactical decision; the arc drifts rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.0)
    Aria’s “empirically whimsical” trait is announced repeatedly but never manifests in a visible trade-off or contradiction; her choices—planting, tending, interpreting—are linear and risk-free. No interior contradiction or embodied cost surfaces, so the arc feels foreordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaito’s grief is credibly embodied (the compass as weight, the lace as untangling), but the “color of unspoken apologies” is declared rather than dramatized; his interiority never contradicts itself in-scene, so the emotional arc feels therapeutic rather than crucible-forged. The final renunciation is visible, yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal—no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maria’s interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.

While consistent, her character serves more as a lens for theme than a pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—uncovering family secrets—is clear, but her interiority leans on abstract declarations (“sense of disorientation,” “overwhelming desire to discover purpose”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.

Her final stance feels earned thematically but lacks causal friction; no path is visibly foreclosed, only embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The survivor’s interiority is grounded in embodied sensation and micro-choices (e.g., activating the heat-map device, nodding to Eli), but her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves smoothly from solace to pride without friction. Eli remains underdeveloped beyond “silently expressive” and musical competence; his presence functions more as prop than crucible. The partnership feels assumed rather than earned through on-page pressure or status negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The undertaker’s motivation—giving rest a permanent address—is consistent and emotionally grounded, but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; instead, it unfolds as sequential realizations. His inadvertently stubborn trait is noted but never actively constrains a choice under pressure. The emotional arc feels earned yet leans on abstract longing (“chased stillness”) rather than embodied struggle. Final peace arrives without visible cost beyond initial weariness, weakening the Earned Stasis claim.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Akira’s gently persistent nature is stated but rarely dramatized through contradictory impulses or costly micro-choices. Her interiority remains abstract (“heart full of hope,” “spirit renewed”) rather than embodied under pressure.

Motivation is consistent but lacks friction or blind spots that would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s motivation is conceptually clear but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“curiosity and trepidation,” “heightened awareness”) rather than sensory, character-specific perception. The protagonist remains passive—reacting to visions rather than making costly decisions—and no flaw meaningfully complicates their path. Final action (gathering the fragment) feels declarative, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "chained liberator" remains an archetype without interior contradiction or embodied struggle; motivation is stated (“plant resilience”) but never tested by conflicting impulses.

The character functions as a vessel for theme rather than an individual with blind spots or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s synesthetic perception and grief-driven motivation are vividly rendered, and her micro-choices (calibrating silence, imprinting sound) reflect a coherent interior logic.

The “sound of trust breaking” emerges cleanly but feels more like revelation than earned struggle. Her backstory is well-anchored but doesn’t pressure present decisions beyond mood.

    Elian’s interiority is consistent but leans on abstract labels (“thoughtfully spirited,” “thawing heart”) rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s phobias and “firmly adaptive” nature are named but not embodied in contradictory impulses during the scene—fear is summarized, not dramatized under pressure. The revelation of betrayal lacks on-page emotional texture or behavioral consequence; it functions as exposition, not lived trauma. Final resolve feels unearned because no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with cost. Interiority leans on diagnostic labels (“phobia-ridden,” “vulnerability is power”) rather than sensory or idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle’s motivation (“mildly obsessed with listening to the silence”) is consistent but underdeveloped as a driver; her actions feel atmospheric rather than compelled by internal contradiction.

The “clean slate seeker” premise is stated, not enacted via micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her connection to the baseball feels imposed rather than earned through behavior. No visible cost or renunciation crystallizes her arc beyond vague determination.

    Lyra’s internal conflict between stability and transformation is present but rendered through summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene. Her “reluctant metamorphosis” lacks micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; instead, change is declared (“felt a shiver,” “transformation was not just about Lyra”). Aria’s motivation is clearer through action (clutching the paper, reaching for the apparition), but Lyra’s pivotal decision to help feels assumed rather than wrestled with under pressure.

    The cartomancer’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory detail and symbolic objects, yet her motivation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—repentance and longing remain abstract yearnings rather than clashing desires that shape micro-choices. Her “willingly perplexed” trait is stated but doesn’t generate tangible trade-offs or errors. The final acceptance feels earned thematically but not causally; no live path is foreclosed with visible cost. Emotional embodiment is poetic but borders on diagnostic (“choking beauty,” “fractures in understanding”) without irrationality or hypocrisy.

    Aurora’s pacifism and resolve are stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Her emotional states shift cleanly without irrationality or hypocrisy, leaning into diagnostic phrasing (“deep sense of resolve,” “ghostly resolve”) rather than visceral contradiction. The lack of internal friction under pressure flattens her arc; stitching is symbolic labor, not a crucible revealing hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s interiority leans on abstract labels (“sensitive to subtle nudges,” “texture of transformation”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her “destiny” is passively received, not wrestled with; the old woman’s prophecy triggers no active resistance or dilemma. The bottled lightning bugs function as motif, not as a lens into Aria’s psyche. Final “peace” feels unearned because no meaningful cost or renunciation is dramatized—only declared.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentinel’s motivation is stated rather than dramatized; her “calmly inventive” trait appears as label, not embodied choice. Interiority leans on abstract declarations (“sense of purpose,” “pride and belonging”) instead of contradictory impulses under pressure. The figure’s reveal lacks relational tension—no status shift, no friction—rendering their alliance feel preordained, not earned. Final action (activating the cradle) carries no visible cost or tradeoff, undercutting character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The herder’s motivation is consistent but interiority leans on abstract labels (“precognitively cursed nature stirred”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices lack visible trade-offs—rock placement feels ritualistic, not pressured. The “smile” at the end reads unearned; no prior struggle manifests as cost. Flawed perception under stress is absent, flattening emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid but leans on diagnostic phrasing like “cartography of scars” and “furiously tranquil,” which risks therapy-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction. Her motivation—to understand hidden patterns—is consistent, yet her actions (clutching a timer, opening an envelope) lack tangible stakes or trade-offs that foreclose options. The final peace feels earned thematically but not causally; no visible cost emerges from her choices. A stronger micro-choice—e.g., destroying the letter instead of reading it—would have grounded her transformation.

    Aurélien’s motivation (“to turn questions into destinations”) is conceptually clear but remains abstract rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. His “diplomatically fierce” demeanor is stated but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or internal conflict under pressure. The mechanical arm and sewing card gesture at depth but don’t constrain choices or reveal blind spots. Final endurance feels unearned because no prior beat shows genuine risk or cost to his worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s motivation (“forge beauty from anarchy”) is clear but remains abstract, lacking concrete contradictions in-scene. Interiority leans on lyrical summary (“eyes shone with curiosity and defiance”) rather than embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure. The molting personalities trait is stated but never enacted with cost or tradeoff. Final resolve feels aspirational, not earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pianist’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory immersion and metaphor, but her motivation remains abstract rather than embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her “strategically creative” trait is asserted but never tested with tangible trade-offs. Emotional states are lyrical yet lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—grief is sustained, not conflicted. The final shift from sorrow to resolve feels earned tonally but not causally through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but lacks concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. Her “empirically whimsical” trait is stated, not dramatized through micro-choices with cost. Internal doubt (“Was she truly preserving…”) remains abstract rather than pressuring decisions. No secondary characters appear to test relationships or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaito’s interiority leans heavily on abstract emotional labels (“sorrow,” “regret,” “peace”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His actions—picking up the compass, weaving lace—are symbolic but lack tangible stakes or struggle. The final renunciation (releasing the compass) feels unearned because no prior beat shows him wrestling with alternatives or costs. Motivation is consistent but flattened into a single emotional register without genuine internal conflict.
