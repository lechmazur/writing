  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interior world is concretely established through her professional lens and shift to dust-pattern observation. Her motivation ("to strip needless drama") is told but then dramatized through precise micro-choices in the greenhouse—sleeping beside the slide, stopping glove use, inviting schoolchildren. The weeping moment and final realization earn the arc, though the internal contradictions remain largely conceptual rather than enacted under immediate pressure. Backstory is extensive (~25%) but anchored to present perception and primes the closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is heavily laden with reflection and epiphany ("Survival, she had learned, was not triumph—it was subtraction"), yet micro-choices under pressure are absent; she simply executes a foregone conclusion. The "visitors came, eventually" passage shifts to external summary without dramatizing a single interaction or decision that tests her stance. The final gift-giving is asserted as character truth rather than earned through on-page conflict between want and cost. Embodied contradiction is replaced by thesis-statement interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("grief and resolve folded into glances") rather than embodied contradiction. Her emotions are performed through poetic description rather than dramatized through simultaneous conflicting impulses. The methodical execution of her heat-mapping lacks genuine struggle or mistake; competence overshadows vulnerability. No moment shows her wanting two incompatible things at once with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The undertaker's motivation is clear and embodied through his occupation and "inadvertently stubborn nature," driving his choice to answer the signals rather than ignore them. His micro-choices—tracing the crack, dismantling the lens with bone-handled tools, embedding shards—are concrete and pressure-driven. The final kneeling moment carries reverence rather than exhaustion, showing earned transformation. Internal contradiction is present but light; the character's emotional arc could deepen further through more conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and consistent—intergenerational support through anonymous care—and her actions align throughout. The piece struggles with internal contradiction; her motives are declared rather than shown through embodied tension, and secondary characters (Kael, Maris) appear as functions rather than pressures. The final choice to pass the bell forward is thematically apt but arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; the ending reads more as continuation than alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    The artist's motivation is abstract—seeking "unused love"—but never tested by contradictory impulses or visceral cost. Interiority relies on lyric summary ("a quiet, gnawing question") rather than embodied contradiction. The pilgrim encounter demands no choice from her; she kneels, matches breath, and receives revelation without forfeiting a live option or confronting a flaw. Final "opening her eyes" functions as passive reception, not agency earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation to discover time's texture is established early and drives her garden work, but interior contradictions remain largely abstract—grief versus joy, anticipation versus regret are catalogued rather than shown competing in real-time choice. The moment she touches the fragment and screams, then collapses weeping, reads embodied, yet the final epiphany arrives as a delivered catalogue ("Grief was coarse. Joy, unexpectedly porous.") rather than earned through a concrete micro-choice under pressure. Retrocognition is labeled but never constrains a present action with visible cost; she moves through the garden freely without friction from the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's physical and sensory details are vivid (calloused fingers, chains clinking), but her interior life remains largely opaque—we see her expertise without genuine struggle or internal contradiction. The mission unfolds with competent execution rather than difficult choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Micro-choices exist (pressing spores into cracks, planting the arrow as marker) but feel more symbolic than emotionally costly. The ending reconfiguration lacks visible internal friction; she walks away transformed in metaphor but not through on-page psychological price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal drive is clear and embodied—she listens with bone and marrow, tracks her own mitosis—but her interior contradictions remain muted. The work at the forge shows purposeful micro-choices, yet the emotional progression feels more asserted than dramatized: tears blur her vision at the crack of trust breaking, but we don't see competing impulses act simultaneously in that peak beat. The final smile and departure read as Earned Stasis with visible cost (leaving the forge, body thinned by hunger), but the interiority leans declarative rather than contradictory under pressure. One additional diagnostic note: the sister's voice hollow is told rather than demonstrated through a choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist operates as pure observer-manipulator without internal contradiction or cost to her own stance. Her motivation is told ("neither greed nor fame, but something purer") rather than tested; she enacts perfect interventions without friction, doubt, or visible trade-off. The reunited couples experience gasps and hesitant hope, but these are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The glassblower's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical narration ("tyranny of productivity," "reverence begins with tending") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices—sweeping, sitting, placing spheres—are rituals announced rather than decisions under pressure that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final "pliant, glowing, and gloriously, quietly, melting" heart reads as declared transformation without the on-page struggle or micro-choices that would earn it. No secondary character pressures her stance, leaving motivation abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on label-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("phobia-ridden," "vulnerability could be weaponized," "trembling certainty is my armor") that flattens embodied emotion. Internal contradictions are stated rather than enacted simultaneously in scene—the character tells us about fear and adaptation rather than showing contradictory impulses colliding in real time. The mentor betrayal is exposition-heavy; the protagonist's response to discovering the evidence lacks moment-to-moment micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "transformation" is asserted through metaphor rather than earned through a dramatized choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    The oracle exists as an abstraction—"mildly obsessed" with "architecture of absence"—but never faces a choice under pressure that embodies those labels. Interiority is purely decorative ("hollows between them, the spaces where meaning collapsed") without contradiction or micro-decision. The final descent is declared, not earned by any on-page struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. No relationship or secondary pressure tests the character; she moves through a solitary meditation unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The robot's progression from mechanical sweeping to self-awareness is earned through accumulative micro-choices across loops. Embodied details are strong ("bristles hovering mid-sweep," manipulators on chest plate), and the realization that thoughts "come from being witnessed" follows naturally from observed technician reactions. The final stance—sweeping "not to clean, but to listen"—demonstrates credible transformation. Minor weakness: the epiphany moment ("Its first thought hadn't been programmed. It had been a reaction—to being seen") edges toward diagnostic clarity rather than earned discovery, though the embodied violin work and loop structure largely support it.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elira's motivation is stated early but her interior life remains thin—she "believed" and "felt" are told, not dramatized through contradictory impulses. The keepers soften and respond but their transformations are gestural (tracing a spiral, pressing a palm) without embodied cost or genuine struggle. The child's hand-touch and Elira's smile read as sentiment markers rather than earned shifts. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; the lens does the work, not the character.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vine dresser's motivation is clear and consistent—she refuses metrics to prove reciprocity—and her actions align with this throughout. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("gardens know their gardeners" drives every choice), with embodied emotion in polishing rituals and the laugh when her wrist-band twitches. The final stance is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of compliance with visible cost (rejecting the intern's demand). Minor slip: the intern interaction feels slightly thin as a pressure test, more symbolic than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's scientific obsession is clear and her mechanically warm demeanor is invoked repeatedly, but most of her interiority consists of abstract scientific claims ("prove that time moves sideways") rather than embodied contradiction. The encounter with her adjacent self offers a beat of recognition and terror, yet the decision to "adjust the lever's angle by 2.7 degrees" feels calibrated rather than emotionally costly—no visible struggle between conflicting impulses in that moment. The ending records findings with synth-tea steam, a quiet choice that fits Earned Stasis, but the path there lacks the micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to decode water-damaged images is established, but her choices feel more observational than decisive until the climactic "performance." Internal contradiction is minimal—she moves through reverence and interpretation without genuine conflict between competing impulses. The ghost-conducting scene offers embodied emotion (trembling, breath held), but the final choice to leave feels like completion of a ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("unraveling," "resolve") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—sweat-damp skin, joints stiff, voice raw. Her internal conflict between silence and release is dramatized through micro-choices (pinning the illustration, stepping onto the gantry, facing the oracle again) rather than summarized. The final stance shift is earned through prior pressure, and the oracle's logged observation of her "softening shoulders" and "first true inhale" provides external confirmation without therapy-speak. Minor: the phrase "quiet courage of unswallowed words yet to come" tilts slightly toward label-speak, but the prior embodied work holds.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—grief-driven, testing her skepticism through action rather than declaration. Internal contradiction is present: she's "religiously skeptical" yet driven by caller testimonies, and this tension propels her tunnel descent. The final shift from seeking external validation to accepting personal weight is earned through the radio discovery, but the protagonist remains somewhat reactive; she uncovers rather than decides under genuine duress. Embodied emotion is strong ("drowsy alertness," "fingers brushing cold metal"), though the epiphany about guilt machinery edges toward articulated insight rather than purely dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper's motivation "to witness change without judgment" is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life consists largely of poetic observation rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The weeping moment ("not for loss, but for beauty") reads as a thesis statement rather than dramatized emotional complexity. The final act of writing to "release" weight lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested under pressure. The eclipse scene shows her singing and offering the curl, but no internal contradiction or meaningful choice emerges—she acts smoothly within her established role without visible cost or foreclosed path. The little girl and others join, but their presence doesn't force Elara to confront competing impulses or alter her stance. Therapy-speak intrudes ("nurture lifelong wonder," "softly adaptive") without embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's interiority is specific and embodied—"fingertips brushing spines as if reading their whispers," "hands knew which pages trembled"—but remains largely observational. The final choice to descend and "learn to weave" arrives through discovery rather than contradiction or struggle; no competing impulse acts simultaneously. The embodiment is strong, yet the protagonist never faces a moment where two wants collide on the page with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is presented through summary rather than contradiction or embodied struggle. His fortune-writing operates via omniscient pattern-matching that feels convenient—he types a warning, a fisherman appears the next day—with no visible cost to his choices or mistakes that compound. The widow and teenager's transformations are told outcomes, not dramatized friction. Internal conflict and genuine flaws remain abstract; Elias glides through his role without the messy irrationality or forfeiture that would charge his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The priest is characterized through vivid sensory particulars (cassock from audio tape, indigo palette) and his interiority shows sophisticated philosophical awareness. However, the protagonist remains more conceptual vessel than embodied individual—his micro-choices feel predetermined by the allegorical design rather than motivated by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation (painting the question mark, dispersing the possession) reads as intellectually inevitable rather than emotionally costly, and the body under stress remains abstract despite the ornate framing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "conduct unheard symphonies" is stated but never tested against meaningful resistance or cost. Her actions—placing the shell, whispering fortunes, "conducting" memories—occur in a vacuum without embodied conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The "chronologically homesick" attribute remains a label without constraining any on-page decision. Interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("she wasn't writing fortunes anymore") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"the gravity defier" never gains interiority beyond label-only traits. Her choices to speak confessions feel unmotivated; no prior causality establishes why *now* she stops running or what internal contradiction drives the shift. Emotions are declared ("I was afraid") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final merge with echo-selves reads as convenient resolution without visible cost that forecloses a credible path.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is embodied through physical sensation (vibrations, palms on floor, tingling hands) and her decision to use the backward phonograph shows agency under pressure. The veterans and teens exhibit embodied emotion (crying from recognition, arrhythmic tapping, startled laughter) rather than labels. However, "It wasn't sadness or grief; it was absence" reads slightly diagnostic, and the students' rapid shift from numbness to presence lacks granular contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—the transformation feels compressed rather than earned through visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is credibly rendered through concrete habits (pressure gradients, wind vectors, courtyard bench routine) and micro-choices under pressure (checking the cache, selecting tools). Internal contradiction surfaces briefly when solitude shifts to movement, though the trait "credibly curious" remains label-only rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The closing reflection "solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it" reads thematic rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; interiority is clean and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") reads as abstract thesis rather than earned interior need. Her "ethically playful heart" is asserted but never shown constraining a choice with visible cost. Silas exists only in exposition; the village elders appear in the final third without prior setup, and their tears of "recognition" arrive without earned contradiction or struggle on the page. The protagonist observes and interprets but makes no micro-choice that forecloses a path or tests competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear—unbinding beauty in the unfinished—but her choices feel more observational than consequential; she kneels, plays, and the greenhouse responds without meaningful resistance or internal contradiction. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("trembling fingers," the child's tears) but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("acoustically perceptive," "not redemption, nor revolution"). The grandmother's backstory occupies substantial space yet does not pivot a present choice. No visible cost forecloses a path; the child's petal-offering feels like validation rather than a decision with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vael's transformation shows embodied contradictions—trembling not from fear but static electricity, gasping from unbearable clarity rather than pain—and the final choice to destroy her wares carries visible cost (market ruin, patron loss). However, the internal journey relies heavily on ornamental interiority ("affectionate detachment," "to let the foreign feeling knit") that labels states rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The chemist's half-truths are absorbed through static rather than tested through on-page micro-choices that pit old transactional habits against emerging empathy, flattening what could be active internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes swiftly but his interior remains surface-level—"whimsically attentive" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The shift from broker to compassion-architect lacks friction; no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies his nightly deliveries. Secondary characters (Marta, Finn, Rook) are sketched efficiently but their reactions read as emotional summary rather than embodied struggle. The cycle's closure offers recognition but no genuine stake-test that would elevate character work above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to join community is clear and drives her search, but her internal landscape tilts heavily abstract ("luminescent ache," "braided loneliness into bridges") without sustained embodied contradiction. The final shift from pleading to welcoming reads more as stated transformation than earned through on-page struggle with genuine doubt or cost. The moth-lashed child and glass-blower remain gestural pressure points rather than forcing difficult choices. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, but interiority leans poetic summary over particularized impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear (find echoes' birthplace, preserve vanished species), and her pendant-borrowing actions are concrete, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The "overborrowing" moment ("Panic threatened, but she sculpted time itself") tells emotion rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to close the sketchbook and release echoes reads more as an endpoint than a decision forged through competing desires with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation—to understand loss through mathematics—is clear and drives her choices across the piece, but interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("comprehension," "calibration") rather than embodied contradiction. The glass-eye handling and equation-threading show micro-choices, yet the protagonist remains insulated from genuine friction or error; every action yields insight without cost until the final realization. The twin's absence creates distance rather than interpersonal pressure, and the orchard's glow-moths and tree recognition feel more symbolic than character-testing. The ending grants discovery without foreclosing a path or showing visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dweller's motivation is clearly established and her methodical reverence for objects drives action, but the character remains more symbolic than embodied. Her tears at the end earn the emotional beat, yet the interior texture leans abstract ("warmth spreading through her ribs, like light through stained glass") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sense-memory fragment delivers one on-page micro-choice (placement atop the microfilm reader), but key turns lack the messy friction of competing wants. No therapy-speak intrudes, and the final choice forecloses invisibility with felt cost, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc is present but heavily weighted toward reflection over embodied action. Her motivation to study plants is told more than shown in pressure-driven choices—most micro-decisions (kneeling, whispering, lowering tools) read as passive observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels asserted ("she understood then") rather than earned through causally linked on-page struggle, and the ending shift from scientist to "participant" lacks visible cost that forecloses a path. Diagnostic label-speak ("photosynthetic sentience," "vegetal will") in peak beats weakens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter's insomnia and brooch-driven obsession are consistently embodied through trembling hands, raw eyes, and seventeen nights of sleeplessness that grounds her desperation. The exchange decision emerges organically from exhaustion and discovery rather than sudden insight, and the final sleep carries genuine cost—she's released the brooch and her canvas. However, the wryly earnest shield feels more asserted than dramatized in action, and the hallucinated woman moment lacks sufficient grounding in prior sensory degradation to feel inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The clairvoyant's interiority shows some specificity through her relationship with the pearl and her "steadily unpredictable" gift, but key emotional beats rely on stock phrasing ("pressure behind her eyes," "deeper, brighter"). The pilgrim remains a cipher whose transformation ("eyes were not the same") is asserted rather than earned through action. The final acceptance reads more like label-summary than embodied contradiction forcing a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's core motivation—compiling fragments into meaning—drives her archive work and leads to the ritual proposal, but her internal experience remains at arm's length. The widow's melody and shipwright's grandson provide external pressure, yet Elira's choices feel observational rather than internally conflicted. Her "reactively visionary" trait is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending ritual feels thematically earned but lacks a visible personal cost that would elevate character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her analytical-artistic trait shows in how she maps the city, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstractions ("mapped her shame as deftly as she mapped sewer tunnles—without judgment, only geometry") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels asserted more than earned through on-page struggle; the "remade" declaration at the end lacks visible cost tied to specific renunciations. The passage through mirrors reflecting doubts is described but not dramatized with concrete choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation to "sculpt space for reflection" is consistently shown through her deliberate actions with the tile, and her skepticism yields to sensation in a credible arc. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstraction—"emotional harmonics," "unheard symphony"—rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to archive the transcription feels quiet and fitting, but it lacks a visible cost that forecloses a competing path; we don't see her sacrifice or renounce anything specific. The "sympathetic skeptic" and "courageously kind" labels are asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The immortal's interiority is concrete and embodied—"sandpapered awe into ennui" and the fragment "humming faintly against his skin like a trapped wasp" ground his exhaustion in physicality. His motivation to reach "what happens after goodbye" shapes every choice, culminating in the earned final action of stepping through despite millennia of immunity to consequence. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak and maintains contradictory impulses: boredom coexisting with reverence, ennui with wonder. Minor detraction: the warlock exchange feels summarized rather than pressured on the page, but the final kneeling gesture carries visible cost—acceptance of vulnerability after eons of invulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The child protagonist displays clear motivation (seeking mathematical fairness versus father's deception) and makes the central choice to use the ink rather than sell it. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("mathematics of fair trade," "deathly vitality") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The parade of secondary characters (mortician, widow, debt collector, politician) are functional but one-note, each receiving ink without resistance or complication. The child's final decision to confront the father is stated as future intent rather than dramatized with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stationer's motivation is clear—collecting textures of different times—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("she measured epochs by the curl of a leaf's edge") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The discovery of someone else's history provides a meaningful turn, with her tears marking "recognition" rather than sorrow, but the emotional progression feels more asserted than dramatized through micro-choices. The final act of leaving the notepad as an offering shows agency with visible cost (abandoning sole ownership), but the preceding beats lack the sustained internal conflict that would elevate this to high-band characterization. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm the single-POV frame.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—seeking texture of erased histories—is established and sustained, but his choices remain observational throughout. The "filtered reality" attribute is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-decisions under pressure. Interior texture relies heavily on poetic assertion ("he heard symphonies of the nameless") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs; he continues collecting at the end as at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    The myth buster's grief over her lost sister grounds her actions, but interiority leans heavily on abstract phrases ("emotional coordinates," "ephemeral compass") rather than embodied sensation. The reimagining of conversations is told rather than dramatized with micro-choices under pressure. The final laugh ("cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs") gestures toward contradiction but arrives as metaphor rather than felt ambivalence. The shift from seeking to acceptance reads more like announced resolution than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's dual allegiance is declared but remains conceptual; her motivation to "navigate gentrification without surrendering memory" feels thematic rather than lived through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "orderly intuitive" trait is label-only—we're told she maps chaos into patterns, but the painting scenes show no on-page struggle or hierarchy of values with visible cost. The foundation stone chip warms and pulses, but this functions as atmospheric decoration rather than embodied emotion or a micro-choice that alters her present stance. Backstory about her prior work with developers is summarized ("she once designed zoning overlays") without anchoring in a present stimulus or tilting a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inspector's motivation is clearly established—purposefully curious, drawn to witness—and her interior voice is specific and embodied. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective exposition rather than micro-choices under pressure; her vigil is observational rather than decisively tested. The final act (labeling the hourglass, descending) carries some renunciation weight, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally fought. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from documentation to communion smoothly without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she repairs to decode failure into direction—but her competence lacks meaningful struggle. The drone repair proceeds without genuine setbacks or choices that foreclose paths; she whispers reassurances and performs her ritual without visible cost or internal friction. The botanist remains passive scenery. Blindness functions as a stated trait rather than a constraint that forces trade-offs in this specific repair.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinctive (ink-stained cuffs, decades of nitpicking) and the motivation is concrete—finding where rivers begin. Internal conflict between isolation and purpose is present but remains largely contemplative; the choice to step onto the ice at the end feels inevitable rather than forged from competing impulses. The falcon and the phrasebook serve as tools, not crucibles; the narrator's agency is mostly observational until the final act. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("permanent squint," "calloused finger"), but peak moments lean on metaphor over visceral contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell tuner remains an archetype rather than a person—no contradictory impulses, no visible internal friction, only "infinitely patient" action. Her choices (strike fork, walk patterns, leave fork) flow from declared method rather than pressure that tests commitment. Interiority is entirely absent; we watch stylized gestures without access to doubt, cost, or trade-off. The piece treats her as an instrument of concept, not a character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" remains abstract throughout; the choice to activate the vial feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page contradiction or internal conflict. The core decision—"override instinct with sheer will"—is told rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is present ("breath hitched," "numb fingers") but the peak beat relies on therapy-speak ("acceptance," "transience flow through you") that flattens the climactic moment. The ending forecloses life with visible cost, meeting closure requirements, but the path there lacks genuine struggle between contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The boy's motivation is dramatized through physical action (slipping through, climbing, kneeling) and his final renunciation when he seals the truth into the lighthouse has visible cost. However, his interiority remains abstract—phrases like "heart hammering" and "voice raw as tide-scoured rock" feel generic rather than character-particular. The spectral witnesses are summoned but remain ornamental; they don't apply immediate pressure that forces the boy to choose between competing goods. His agency at closure (pressing the lattice into the lens) forecloses a path, but the internal contradictions that would make the choice difficult are never embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost bride lacks genuine agency—she drifts, places, and fades without interior contradiction or a decision under pressure. Elara arrives late (well past midpoint) and her single gasped realization feels unearned; we see no prior struggle or micro-choice that would justify sudden "searing clarity." The bride's motivation ("lovingly venomous") is declared but never embodied through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodiment is abstract: "translucent palm," "threads unraveling"—label-only gestures rather than specific sensation or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    The weaver remains more archetype than individual—her interior life consists of poetic declarations rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. No meaningful choice occurs on the page; she performs a ritual of mending without genuine struggle, cost, or foreclosed alternatives. The "hauntingly optimistic" label is asserted but never embodied in a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Emotions are named ("stubborn hope") rather than shown through embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to rebuild faith is clear and drives her excavation work, but her internal experience remains abstract—"warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or visceral struggle. The orchard's approval ("roots curled gently around her wrists...as if the orchard itself approved") replaces earned tension with convenient affirmation. Her final weeping reads as release rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Villagers arriving at dawn feels orchestrated rather than pressured by her prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to discover meaning in the margins") is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting under pressure. Her grandmother's postal-archivist backstory and the lost-letter wound arrive as summary blocks that do not tilt a present choice. The character remains a static vessel for the concept; we see careful preparation but no on-page decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists largely of abstract philosophical claims ("meaning didn't need permanence to be real") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    The embroiderer's motivation is clear and her actions under pressure are consistent, but interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. Key moments like "listening for unheard stories" and "disguising wisdom as foolishness" are told attributes without micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final sleep feels convenient rather than earned through visible exhaustion or cost, and the character's internal experience during the coup's culmination is summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The medium's interior state is embodied through physical action (pressing shard, walking deeper, tracing words), and the moonlight healing trait creates a visible cost (memory loss). However, the protagonist remains largely passive—spirits, moonlight, and the labyrinth act upon her rather than her making difficult choices that narrow options. The final "smile" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses wrestling in scene. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("fierce tenderness" as a descriptor rather than embodied state).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clearly signaled (graft new meaning onto old wounds), but her agency is largely reflective rather than tested by conflict. The interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent gaze") that tells rather than embodies contradiction under pressure. The coral and cast serve as props for witnessing rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The "unknotting" action functions more as metaphor than a choice that forecloses a path, though the final gesture (pressing coral to cast, whispering affirmation) does show micro-agency with a gentle cost (acceptance of kinship over escape).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation to rediscover joy is articulated but largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The fragment triggers reflection that shifts her stance, and the final choice to return "not to restore what was lost, but to paint new joys" demonstrates earned change. However, interiority leans toward label-speak ("the lost joy of creation unburdened by expectation") and therapeutic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to display the fragment and the final decision to return carry visible cost (abandoning preservation for awakening) but lack the ambivalence and struggle that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions flow smoothly without visible internal conflict—the methodically playful trait is asserted ("grinned," "laughed, breathless") but never costs her anything or forces a difficult choice. The climax dissolves into passive reception ("let the stories move through her") rather than an earned alteration rooted in prior struggle. The final stance shift reads as granted epiphany rather than hard-won renunciation with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    The rogue scholar's interior is largely absent; we see her actions but rarely her contradictory impulses under pressure. Dr. Vex's hesitation over the lullaby phrase offers a brief moment of internal conflict, but the protagonist remains opaque throughout. The motivation to "stand guard over her own spark" is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices that reveal competing values with visible cost. The ending distributes agency across a collective ("others stood with her") rather than focusing on the protagonist's earned transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interiority is established through vivid images (hollow bones, voice "stubbornly full"), but her choices remain mostly static—she sings, she writes, she curls around the postcard. The warming postcard moment ("They're listening. Keep singing.") prompts her to continue rather than alter course, showing endurance but not contradiction or a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "shyly unstoppable" attribute is mentioned but not dramatized through a micro-choice where shyness visibly competes with determination. Reflection dominates without on-page micro-choices that tilt present stance, flattening pressure despite poetic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The caretaker's interior world is rich with sensory detail and her actions (whispering names, tilting the chime) embody her role consistently. However, she faces no genuine internal conflict or competing impulse across the piece—her duty is performed without hesitation, doubt, or cost that would foreclose a path. The mention of other caretakers who "faltered" remains backstory rather than present pressure testing her resolve. The final smile reads as satisfaction of routine rather than a choice earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The linguist's meticulous cross-referencing and cautious exuberance show embodied contradiction, though her interior voice tilts toward elevated diction ("symphonies of truth weren't metaphorical") that strains credibility for someone under archive dust. The curator's brief presence adds pressure without muddying focus. Motivation is clear—restore trust through linguistic resurrection—but the protagonist's flawless execution (she never stumbles, only "immediately double-checks") undercuts genuine struggle, and the final collective singing feels more like validation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The machinist's interiority is dense but often abstract ("encrypted compassion," "harmonize conflicting values") rather than embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by a genuine on-page dilemma that forces her to choose between competing goods with visible cost. Trembling appears twice as a label without differentiated physical manifestation. The final "rebellion" is narrated as future intent rather than dramatized action, so no renunciation or alteration forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs is established early and her actions (training pigeons, mapping dust motes) align with this drive. The three reinventions feel more decorative than motivationally active—they're told rather than shown constraining choices. The meteorite discovery prompts genuine embodied emotion ("She wept quietly, ink smearing"), but the final transformation from forgery to composition arrives too swiftly without intermediate struggle. The character arc lands but lacks the earned contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is heavily abstracted through metaphysical apparatus (thresholds, grain patterns, necessary distances) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her final "step off the terrace" reads as symbolic dissolution, not a choice with visible personal cost—the decision lacks a live alternative she's foreclosing. The backstory about her father dominates the present frame without anchoring micro-choices that tilt her stance on the page. Diagnostic label-speak appears in peak beats: "featherly determined" is repeated as a trait label without dramatized tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") remains largely interior and abstract throughout. While the piece offers embodied moments (hand to glass, breath fogging), the emotional arc relies heavily on told insights ("no longer lonely," "quiet purpose") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final choice to ascend feels like resolution by assertion rather than a decision forged under competing pressures with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The recollectionist's emotional interiority is present throughout ("delight," "recognition," "giddy sorrow") but her choices feel more like discovery steps than pressure-driven decisions with visible stakes. The epiphany at the crater glass ("The missing pieces weren't lost. They were given away") arrives as declared insight rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final decision to "carry it" and "wear the missing pieces as adornments" reads as emotional summary without a prior path foreclosed or visible cost that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established through external behavior—arranging props, tossing coins, reciting poetry—but his interiority remains abstract. The motivation "to serenade monotony with creativity" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. The three audience members receive vignettes of transformation, but their changes happen *to* them rather than through active choices that complicate pressure. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path is visible; Elias ends exactly where he began, conducting serendipity without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract, poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her exile and dance are asserted through elevated language ("vessel launching verses into the void") but we see no micro-choices that reveal competing impulses or genuine cost until the collapse. The final interaction with the child gestures toward change, but the decision to teach feels inevitable rather than earned through prior internal conflict. Motivation remains coherent but lacks the messy, contradictory texture required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glazier's interiority is concrete and consistent—his observation-driven method and motivation are embodied through the prism work and stone-drop ritual. However, no meaningful choice under pressure appears; he moves through a habitual morning with gentle reflection but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The father's backstory anchors his perceptual stance effectively, and embodied details (calloused fingers, knees protesting) ground the character. The lack of stakes-driven agency prevents higher scoring despite strong texture.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The firefighter's motivation to translate pain is established, but his interior life remains abstract—"fault lines where grief had settled" and "mined language" feel like poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The letters provide external pressure, but his micro-choices (reading aloud, leaving his own note) lack visible cost or resistance that would reveal hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is present in "knees creaking," yet peak moments default to lyric assertion ("hard softness of his resolve") instead of dramatized struggle. The final act of scattering letters registers as symbolic gesture without on-page friction or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. "Lucidly watchful" functions as a label; we see observation but not the cost of that detachment or moments where it wavers under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("hope wasn't a feeling—it was a structure") rather than embodied emotion. The final smile is asserted serene without showing the trade-offs that earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartographer's motivation is consistent and her perceptual method (listening through "the hollow behind her ribs") creates a specific interior texture. However, her agency remains largely observational until the final act of leaving her sketch—a gesture that feels more symbolic than consequential. The diaries' anonymous voices are evocative but their specificity (mother, scientist, lover) reads as demographic sampling rather than individuated pressure. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the protagonist moves smoothly from discovery to witness to departure without internal friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    The painter exists as a vessel for imagery rather than a character with interior contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motives are told in abstract terms ("borrowed heartbeat," "unguarded rhythm of hope") without dramatized stakes or embodied cost. The phrase "perceptively calm, as if she'd expected this all along" tells rather than shows stance, and no decision point alters her path. No relationship pressure exists, and the closure smile arrives without earned tension or visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interior is concrete and particular—"the operatively gentle cadence of someone who had buried too many compromises"—with embodied emotion (tracing grooves, feeling resolve beneath ribs). The solitary design limits relationship pressure; her motivation to return after failure shows endurance with cost. However, the final choice (soldiers signing) feels externalized; we lack internal contradiction or a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a visible path for *her*. The ending reads as ceremonial completion rather than a protagonist decision that alters her own stance with legible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's contradictory nature—ruthless water engineer who hoards extinct bird echoes—is established early and motivates the ritual. His sentimentality is embodied through the mother memory and the preserved recordings, not merely labeled. The final choice to leave the egg and walk away shows renunciation with cost (he relinquishes the object and returns to his destructive work). However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("echo was enough") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment, and the backstory block explaining his crusade occupies substantial space without generating present micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The courtesan's motivation (poetry over flesh, defiance of conformity) is stated but never dramatized through a concrete on-page choice with competing impulses. Her work untangling threads proceeds without internal conflict or visible cost—no moment where restraint wars with revelation, no trade-off between solitude and connection. The final smile reads as arrival rather than earned transformation; no path is foreclosed. Interiority remains abstract ("furnace of her refusal") rather than embodied and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The calligrapher's motivation is clear and his arc—from weaponizing aesthetics to embracing accountability—is dramatized through the story stick and puppet rehearsal. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract epiphany language ("half-lit epiphanies," "moral evasion") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final choice to return to Mira with a new show feels asserted more than earned by on-page micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Mira's accusation ("You make poison look like calligraphy") anchors the conflict effectively, but the protagonist's transformation occurs largely in reflective summary rather than through pressured decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is heavily abstract and label-driven ("esoteric realist," "devotional," "transiently rooted") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions—knotting, placing, bowing—are deliberate but lack genuine internal conflict; she executes a ritual without on-page struggle or cost that would foreclose another path. The final departure reads as predetermined rather than earned by pressure that tested her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific ("snowmelt ardor—that fierce, thawing tenderness") with micro-choices threaded throughout the ritual. However, motivation reads more as declared theme than dramatized conflict; the caster never confronts a genuine obstacle or internal contradiction that would force a foreclosing choice. Embodied emotion is present but the trajectory from guilt to release lacks the contradictory impulses that would create authentic tension. The character endures and enacts rather than decides under pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is articulated clearly (discovering why paths choose walkers), anchored in childhood trauma, and manifested through deliberate physical actions (palm on seal, descent into dream). However, interiority leans heavily toward abstract philosophizing ("paths choose their walkers when the walker's essence resonates") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to take the wafer seal and walk into the storm feels more like acceptance of a delivered truth than a decision forged from competing impulses with visible cost. The character endures and receives revelation, but agency at closure reads passive.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The astronomer's motivation (encrypted devotion, frugal sacrifice) is established through concrete detail—sold cloak, barley cakes, traded inheritance—but interiority remains largely abstract and label-driven ("empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion"). The character observes and enacts ritual without visible internal contradiction or a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost; the final "Confirmed" reads as data collection rather than renunciation or stance crystallization. Embodied emotion is scarce; the prose tells us he "did not smile" and "did not weep" but offers no contradictory impulse acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is heavily reflective, with long passages explaining pacifism, resentment, and cellular memory rather than showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. The turn at the end—melody migrating inward, shoulders dropping—reads as asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Embodiment is present ("clenched jaw from childhood, stiff shoulders from betrayal") but the cataloging feels diagnostic rather than lived. The final choice to leave the box and walk into mist lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mirror maker's motivation is clear and her task-driven interiority is concrete ("dreams, like glass, reflect only when properly angled"), but internal contradiction is absent—she moves through her ritual without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The dream's descent feels passive rather than earned by her choices; it arrives because she breathes correctly, not because she wrestles with cost or risk. Embodied emotion is present in trembling hands and synchronized breath, but the protagonist never faces a moment where her wants conflict with her needs or where blind spots generate compounding mistakes. The final choice—pressing glass against the dream—lacks visible cost; the dream "did not resist" and simply flows in, undermining the weight of alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mender's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete gestures (ribbon in pocket, humming her mother's tune), and the daughter's absence creates palpable pressure. Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between persistence and the wound of rejection. However, the final "footprints beside her" and green fabric feel unmotivated—no prior scene work earns the daughter's physical arrival, weakening the cost of the mender's endurance. The choice to persist is declared more than tested in a crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The curator's interiority is specific and embodied—"theory breathe," "humming in her bones like a tuning fork"—with contradictory impulses evident in her chuckle about bathrooms amid cosmic inquiry. Her final shift from bewildered to awake is earned through the accumulated touches of petals dissolving into skin and the cameo opening. Minor slip: the bathroom revelation feels somewhat convenient, though it's lampshaded with self-aware humor. The progression from confusion to understanding is clear and rooted in her particular way of perceiving gaps in the Archive.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's interior is filtered through elevated diction ("semantic blooms," "verb root splitting") that reads more like thematic exposition than embodied thought under pressure. The botanical diary functions as a prop for exposition rather than revealing contradictory impulses. Kael's realization at the end feels delivered rather than earned through prior struggle. The lack of embodied emotion or micro-choices that cost something specific prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's "chimera twin" nature creates an interesting internal contradiction, but her choices feel more contemplative than agonized—she moves through the ship observing and inviting rather than facing hard trade-offs until the final moment. The climactic choice ("I am both. And neither. And all.") arrives with some embodied hesitation ("fingers trembling"), but the cost of recapturing Lirien versus leaving her remains abstract; we don't see what specific path is foreclosed. The interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("blissfully aberrant—not broken, not cursed") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Embodiment is present but occasionally relies on stock gestures (clutching, trembling) without character-particular physical signature.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and her methodical nature drives her choices consistently. However, her competence faces little genuine struggle—she solves the puzzle smoothly without meaningful friction or error. The trait "warmly methodical" remains largely label-only; we're told she's patient and precise, but no on-page moment forces her to choose between warmth and method under cost. The final choice to leave the rope feels inevitable rather than earned through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ripple-mark is anchored by concrete details—map-skin, bare-foot reading of vibrations, a deliberate method—but her interiority remains thin. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves with serene competence and no visible struggle between wants. The final choice to move to "the next cavern" lacks cost or foreclosed options; it reads as continuation rather than a path lost. Embodied emotion is present in "hammered repose" but that phrase does the work for many paragraphs without fresh contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The custodian's interiority is filtered through elevated, lyric diction that maintains consistency but borders on therapeutic abstraction ("thistle-blown hope, that stubborn weed-rooted optimism"). Her motivation to prove coincidences have meaning drives the central action, and the final shift from custodian to conduit is earned through the star-tracking ritual. However, the epiphany that "she had been summoned" arrives via narrated insight rather than embodied struggle, and the contradictory impulses remain largely interior rather than enacted in scene. The piece favors poetic articulation over friction-laden micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The archivist remains a static vessel for atmospheric observation rather than a character under pressure. Her "preemptive nostalgia" is asserted repeatedly as a label without dramatized internal contradiction or cost-bearing choice. The final smile and signed raindrop read as gestures rather than decisions that foreclose options. Interiority consists largely of poetic summary ("her heart ached," "she conjectured") without embodied perception or micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is declared—defying hopelessness through pyrotechnic ritual—but her interiority remains opaque throughout. We receive lyric descriptions of her movements and chants, yet no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that reveal character hierarchy. The final laugh "from the sheer audacity of joy reclaimed" tells the emotion rather than embodying it through specific action or contradiction. The journey feels ornamental rather than earned by visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler's interiority is textured and specific ("not by staring head-on at destiny, but by grazing its periphery"), with embodied perception (chill climbing her wrist, vibration in molars). However, her final choice—accepting suspension rather than forcing resolution—feels more contemplative than causally earned; the internal contradiction between wanting to discover time's texture and choosing to remain in pause lacks visible pressure that would make the renunciation cost more. The companion's presence applies light relational pressure, but his silence and hesitation mirror hers without forcing a meaningful trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    The child's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("claustrophobia wasn't just fear; it was their first language") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to let go "not of the doll, but of the fear" reads as a declared epiphany rather than a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost—the child simply falls "through a fold in the sky" without forfeiting a live alternative. Emotional progression flows smoothly through wonder without the friction of competing impulses that would show internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The operator's interiority is present and filtered through professional attention (storm glass monitoring, ear calibration), but his motivation remains abstract—"to teach silence how to comfort" is asserted rather than rooted in contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandmother backstory and first passenger memory anchor his practice without dramatizing a hierarchy of values under current pressure. Agency appears as micro-adjustments (weight shift, tilt) that produce outcomes, yet the woman's transformation reads mechanical rather than earned through protagonist struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lore keeper remains largely opaque—her motivation is stated ("to find the stairway") but interior contradiction and embodied emotion are thin. She moves through set-pieces (waterfall, mural, hatch, stairway, throne) with minimal genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized cost; she "chose the version who sallied forth" reads as label rather than earned renunciation. Interiority leans toward stock fantasy-quest phrasing ("wisely adventurous," "rightful claimants") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is presented through abstract labels ("tender shadow keeper") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Interiority consists of metaphorical assertions ("burns bridges carefully") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The closure moment—stepping through the threshold—lacks visible cost tied to a concrete trade-off; the protagonist enacts symbolic gestures (hovering, pressing, whispering) without dramatized struggle or foreclosed paths. Therapy-speak intrudes at peak beats: "teach suffocating to breathe," "lungs remember air," "permission to fumble in the dark."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's arc from pyramid-scheme survivor to volunteer shows clear motivation rooted in hollowed-out trust, and her "virtuously mischievous" choice to play along "out of spite" rings true. The bolt as totem and the channeling of betrayals into the seam demonstrate embodied emotion. However, the convergence moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she channels pressure without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses a competing want, and the final sleep "without nightmares" reads as too-tidy emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear interiority and embodied sensory training (coastal caves, standing waves as tuning method), but her response to the revelation—that she is the swapped heir—reads too smooth, lacking contradictory impulses in the moment. The shift from "dynasty ender" to "restoration" arrives as cognitive realization without visible emotional cost or conflicting desires acting simultaneously on the page. Motivation is consistent but the peak beat (hearing her mother's voice, learning her own identity) needed messier, more irrational simultaneous reactions to earn the final calm.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The knight's interior life is registered through metaphor and gesture rather than embodied sensation—"unsnapped" joints and "organic surrender" read as conceptual rather than visceral. The motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" remains abstract across most beats; we see no micro-choice that tests competing goods or trades one desire against another. The final laugh and walk feel declared rather than earned by prior contradiction or visible cost. No other character appears to apply relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's interior is well-rendered through concrete actions (photographing dust, documenting kindnesses) and her emotional arc from viewing her role as "preserving loss" to "turning memorials into living stories" feels earned. However, the transformation happens largely in summary ("She'd spent years believing...But this—this was different") rather than through on-page contradiction or struggle. The micro-choices (lifting the button, switching off lights, opening the logbook) accumulate pressure but the final stance crystallization lacks visible cost—her healing is declared rather than forfeited against something she values.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's resourcefulness is shown through concrete actions (tweezers, soldering iron, bicycle dynamo), and her motivation is clear. However, interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied—"Heart drumming against her ribs" is the only visceral marker in a high-stakes infiltration. The final vanishing act undercuts agency; she completes her mission but then disappears without facing immediate consequence, softening the cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; we see careful competence but not the fear or doubt that would make her fully human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The saxophonist's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (embouchure shifts, breath control), but interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandmother memory provides grounding, yet the protagonist's internal conflict remains more atmospheric than dramatized—he executes his task with competence but little visible struggle between competing wants. The final choice to leave feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page tension between renunciation and desire. Embodiment is present but the stakes never force a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elira's motivation is stated clearly but her choices lack meaningful internal conflict or embodied cost. The transformation from seed-sorter to memory-weaver unfolds through exposition rather than dramatized struggle; we're told she "understood" and "realized" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother's benediction ("You sorted silence") arrives as external validation rather than earned insight from prior micro-choices. Interiority relies on label-only feelings ("mossy delight," "gasped") and the final state feels declarative rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation rooted in his need to understand why mechanisms fail, and the arc from imposing order to embracing uncertainty is earned through concrete experience. However, the transformation relies heavily on reflective summary rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene—the admiral's journal delivers the insight via direct statement ("Plans are anchors"), and the final shift is told through activities (carving steps, eating mushrooms) rather than a dramatized choice under pressure. The embodied detail is strong in places (oil-stained hands, compass trembling), but peak moments lean toward poetic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal arc—moving from "Elara the Even" to "Elara the Mended"—is traceable and her final renunciation (accepting fracture as part of beauty) reads as earned. However, the peak beat relies heavily on abstract interiority ("luminous regret," "the gravity of unresolved purpose") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The naming ritual provides embodied action, but the interior voice drifts into label-heavy therapeutic register ("calcified...stone she carried beneath her ribs") that flattens texture under pressure. Micro-choices are present but their costs remain more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    The collector's interiority remains largely opaque—we see her actions but rarely feel contradictory impulses in real time. "Modest fearlessness" is declared rather than dramatized through a moment where dread and warmth compete. The ghosts receive more embodied attention (the boy snorting, the woman's translucent fingers) than the protagonist's inner life under pressure. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; she proceeds with serene competence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma-mapped body are established early, but interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment of releasing the pewter strap attempts earned change, but the decision feels contemplative rather than forced by competing impulses acting simultaneously. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("trauma is also a method of remembering," "testimony becomes transformation") appears in peak beats without dramatized cost within the lines. The final walk forward reads as insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist translator carries sufficient interiority through memory and gesture ("my soles remembering," "barefoot across hemp planks"), and the historian arrives with "eyes hollowed by years of archival dust." Motivation coheres around recovering erased cultures. However, the protagonist's arc relies heavily on told competence ("I trade in truths too delicate for common tongues") rather than on-page struggle or contradiction under pressure; the lens transaction and triptych reading proceed smoothly without meaningful resistance or cost to the translator's own stance. The historian's transformation is asserted ("he weeps quietly, not from sorrow, but recognition") rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The technician's motivation (discovery vs. repair) is clear and his observant nature drives micro-choices throughout. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—he witnesses, documents, and whispers acknowledgment, but never faces a meaningful internal contradiction or makes a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ghost encounter proceeds smoothly without struggle or consequence that alters him. His daughter mention and the final smile feel like tidy emotional tags rather than earned complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    The operator's motivation—to compress eternity—is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or stakes that matter to her personally. Interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual language ("equilibrium was entropy's favorite disguise") rather than embodied emotion or character-specific perception. The climactic moment (reaching into the aperture, seizing her mother's smile) arrives without prior tension between competing desires, and the cost of "ruined perfection" reads as cosmic rather than personal. No credible internal conflict shapes the choice to uncork the whisper; she "expected this" deflates the tension of rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The revolutionary's interiority is concrete and embodied—"fingers tracing the crystal vase shard like a rosary of regrets"—and his arc from militant to mourner to translator is causally grounded. Internal contradiction surfaces when he shifts from burying the old order to exhuming it, though the transition feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Dr. Voss arrives late and her presence accelerates the ending, but her own interiority remains thin; the final weeping and "shared awe" edge toward label-only emotion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The repairman's internal state is established through embodied guilt (the child who never smiled again) and his voice/actions shift under pressure (trembling hands, singing rather than mechanical repair). However, interiority frequently defaults to elevated register ("mourning the lie before it's even spoken," "the weight of honesty made manifest") that reads more like thematic narration than character-particular thought. The moment of singing to the box offers a concrete micro-choice, but the final weeping "not from sorrow, but wonder" risks label-speak at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation to find "the place where explanations fail" is established early and drives her descent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to leave the compass and step into the passage forecloses return, providing visible cost, yet the decision feels more like confirming a pre-existing stance than wrestling with contradictory impulses in the moment. Embodied emotion appears ("gasped, pulling back as if burned, yet smiling") but is overwhelmed by label-heavy philosophical narration ("sensibly eccentric soul finally aligned"). The psychometry sequence offers concrete sensory detail, but Riel's terror and awe arrive as summary rather than lived pressure that Elira must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are stated early (scaffold complexity with simplicity) but remain abstract; the progression from seeing the slide's image to carving is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her realization about timewoven alliances arrives through exposition ("she realized") rather than embodied discovery. The final choice to teach villagers feels declared rather than earned by prior on-page struggle with competing desires. Interiority leans toward thesis articulation rather than moment-specific contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The artist's motivation is clear and embodied through her collection, journey, and careful observation. However, the protagonist's trajectory is largely observational—she discovers encoded flowers, weeps in understanding, then paints—without a decision that forecloses a meaningful path with visible cost. The final stance ("she still reckons—not to solve, but to surrender") feels asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or sacrifice. Internal conflict is minimal; she encounters no competing impulse that would test her quietly driven nature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains a vessel for thematic statements rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claim ("it wasn't meant for machines, but for souls retrocognitively trapped") and therapy-inflected self-awareness ("she knew then she was retrocognitively trapped—not as punishment, but as witness"). The final "choice" to become archive is declared rather than earned through on-page friction between competing wants. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats summarize her actions in elevated diction without visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear—to reimagine rather than restore—but interior contradiction and embodied emotion are thin. His actions (sweeping dust into mandalas, placing objects at lanterns) feel symbolic rather than driven by urgent internal conflict. The child's question and the alchemist's answer provide a micro-choice moment, but the protagonist never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; he simply continues his process until the town responds. The lack of genuine struggle or earned change keeps this in the functional but limited band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority is vividly embodied through sensory detail ("velvet disquiet spreading through her bones") and her gift functions as both trait and curse. However, her final choice to "awaken" the orchard and release petals feels more announced than earned by prior internal conflict—the shift from archivist to activist happens via exposition ("she understood then") rather than through dramatized struggle. The businessman's smile provides a micro-consequence, but Elira herself pays no visible cost for crossing this threshold. Motivation remains clear throughout, but the peak choice lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal landscape is richly textured ("furiously tranquil," "vibrating at the frequency where rage and peace fuse") but the contradiction remains largely asserted rather than enacted through competing impulses in scene. Her decisive acts—lifting the acorn cap, walking barefoot, pressing it into the dais—flow without meaningful hesitation or trade-off visible on the page. The embodied details (trembling fingers, acorn ridges imprinting warmth) anchor sensation, but no moment shows her genuinely torn between paths or paying a felt interpersonal or internal cost that forecloses an option. The final stance feels earned by atmosphere and inheritance lore rather than by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is established through consistent action (measuring, waiting, recalibrating) and her stance against false alarms is embodied in the sensor work. However, interiority remains thin—her choices are narrated rather than felt through embodied contradiction or struggle. The smile at "Not yet" offers a glimpse of personality, but the piece leans heavily on lyric description over psychological depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The janitor's motivation is consistent—seeking strength in vulnerability through witnessing stellar deaths—and his backstory (Grand Celestial Archive transfer) provides clear grounding. However, interiority leans heavily toward poetic meditation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the comet encounter produces tears and recognition but no meaningful choice that forecloses a path. The final return to sweeping reads as affirmation rather than earned transformation with visible cost, limiting the score despite clear voice and stable characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recluse demonstrates consistent interiority through embodied perception—tracing the box rim, wrapping her body around it during storms, interpreting ghosts through contextual clues. Her tranquil perceptiveness functions as a trait that shapes her observational method, though the story withholds micro-choices that would reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The covenant binding her is stated but never tested through a live dilemma that forces her to choose between competing goods with visible cost. The beekeeper ghost's final gratitude moment gestures toward closure but lacks the protagonist's agency-driven alteration or renunciation that would earn higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vey's motivation—understanding time's texture—is established early and shapes their curation activity, but the transformation from bureaucrat to curator lacks embodied struggle; the heartbeat-by-emotion premise is evocative yet remains label-only without constraining a pivotal choice. Lira appears functional but could be any sympathetic stranger; her grief is asserted more than dramatized. The final shift to "curating echoes" feels thematically declared rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a prior path. Internal contradiction and embodied emotion are present in fragments but do not act simultaneously under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority is richly embodied ("fingers tracing ripples as if reading braille") and her motivation—discovering beauty in the incomplete—drives her approach to the boy. The turn from observer to tender is credible, though her internal contradiction is limited; she accepts incompletion without struggle. The boy's shift from hollow-eyed to curious feels slightly accelerated, arriving through her intervention more than his own agency. Minor voice convergence: both speak in similar lyric registers at the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arlen's motivation (interspecies respect) is clear and his systematic approach is established early, but the character operates in near-total isolation for most of the piece, rendering him more monument than person. His "gently systematic" unwinding of the trapped sparrow provides one embodied moment of choice under pressure, but the dying-man framing dilutes urgency—he faces no genuine internal conflict or trade-off because the terminal diagnosis pre-resolves all stakes. The villagers and animals remain props rather than sources of friction; relationships never pressure his choices, and the end arrives as a soft fade rather than a decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is dense and textured, with embodied sensations (boots sinking, scent of petrichor, pulse slowing). However, the journey reads more as philosophical meditation than dramatized choice under pressure. The "realization" that truth is emergent arrives through reflection rather than a concrete decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (skeptic vs. intuition, equations vs. pilgrimage) but remains largely conceptual rather than forcing incompatible actions in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman's motivation is articulated through action—collecting seeds, kneeling, speaking to birds—but his interiority remains largely opaque; we see ritual without the contradictory impulses or visceral embodiment that would elevate character work. The sequence "not for show, not for ghosts, but because the birds still listened" tells rather than dramatizes his internal logic. Choices (crushing pods, placing seeds at specific spots) are present but feel procedural rather than arising from visible internal conflict or cost. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned on the page; he performs his task and departs unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Bracken's interior world is richly textured through embodied perception (sniffing the wind, reading grooves), but the transformation from body-finder to voice-keeper occurs largely off-page in summary. The motivation "to translate distance into closeness" drives his decoding work, yet the closure cost—his emotional shift from hunting the dead to resurrecting them—is told rather than dramatized through a specific renunciation or contradiction. The wax leaf functions as a recurring image but does not force a meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistent and particular—sketching as a habitual response to confusion, the gilded compass as a tactile anchor. Her choice to remain and to witness is clearly motivated. However, the piece relies heavily on reflective summaries ("she understood: true north wasn't celestial") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The emotional progression is smooth and contemplative but lacks friction; no impulse competes with her decision to stay and sketch, reducing the visible cost of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elric's motivation ("sacredly playful urge," "surrender to embrace the unknown") is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal friction. The swapping action proceeds smoothly without visible cost or hesitation that would prove his chivalrous nature under pressure. Interiority relies on elevated abstraction ("heart swelling with the joy of surrender") rather than embodied particulars. The widow's tear and comet's breath are ornamental rather than choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's identity as "crisis actor turned real crisis survivor" delivers an intriguing contradiction, and the motivation to document small gestures is specific. However, interiority remains abstract and metaphorical throughout—"raw, luminous absence" and "the trailing edge of displaced light"—without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final confrontation with the new sovereign is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No visible cost forecloses a path; the protagonist simply continues walking.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The seer's interiority leans heavily on abstract layering ("mercury-glass," "obsidian wind," "frequency of home") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under immediate pressure. Her backstory of finding others' talents is told rather than shown affecting present action. The final kneeling moment ("not in worship, but in arrival") gestures toward resolution but lacks visible cost or a foreclosed path—she simply receives sanctuary. Internal voice is dense and consistent, but the protagonist's agency reads passive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tutor's internal journey from exile to self-forgiveness is traced through embodied detail—fidgeting fingers, tracing phantom boards—and her micro-choices (kneeling, winnowing, tracing fog) show contradictory impulses under pressure. The mirror confrontation earns the shift from self-punishment to acceptance, with "I see you" carrying visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("winnowing the past until only truth remained") and the pupil's shattering is told rather than dramatized, reducing the felt weight of her original transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The artist's devotion to complexity over coherence offers a clear internal logic, and her progression from public sessions to solo confession earns the final gesture. However, interiority remains abstract—"weight of what she intended," "devotion to complexity"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The child beat provides embodied micro-choice (kneeling, singing breath not words), but the protagonist's own emotional stakes stay declarative rather than lived through competing wants. The final whisper carries cost but lacks the friction of a genuine renunciation because we never see what simpler truth she's sacrificing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist's interior is densely rendered but relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("kintsugi intentions," "quilts memories together") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The matching of pockmarks to personal wounds reads more as ritual description than genuine internal conflict driving micro-choices. The final stance—standing rather than fleeing—lacks visible cost because we never see her genuinely tempted to abandon the work. Embodiment is present (trembling hands, breath hitching) but the psychological architecture feels more like poetic assertion than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter's motivation is clear—keeping a promise to herself—and her choice to enter the cave, paint, and leave the shell behind shows agency. Interiority leans heavily on lyric reflection ("borrowed glass," "quiet miracles") that stays generic rather than embodied; at peak moments ("I'm still here") the emotion is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final renunciation (leaving the shell) forecloses a path but arrives without visible internal friction or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she believes whispers carry truth farther than shouts—and her action (using the cork) is goal-driven. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("raw and trembling," "relief, thick as honey") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The captain's transformation occurs too smoothly without genuine resistance or cost visible in his micro-choices. Internal conflict is asserted more than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The navigator's moon-phase fluctuation is stated but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—it remains decorative physiology. Interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion ("lattices of meaning," "tapestry—one that maps absences") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final singing of coordinates feels like a repeated ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The forager's internal contradiction between involuntary truthfulness and the need to occlude is dramatized through both internal tension and the glass-eye totem. Her micro-choices—kneeling to harvest, choosing metaphorical language with the survivors, finally releasing the relic—show hierarchy of values with visible cost. The empathy-virus backstory is substantial but anchors in present stimuli (the trembling survivors, the truffle's scent) and tilts her stance toward release. Embodied emotion is strong ("trembling at touch, weeping at minor slights") but occasionally slips toward label-only affect in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is vivid and particular—his belief that "memory could be borrowed" through residue shapes his investigation. However, his choices remain largely observational until the ending; the pinning gesture feels more thematic than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The stranger's backstory (alpine pass, Elara Vogt) arrives summarized rather than earned through embodied struggle. Internal contradiction is present but muted; Silas's eccentric stance never truly collides with a competing impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is dense with metaphor ("dust-hung quiet," "empirically intuitive mind") but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. His motivation—the childhood promise to his sister—arrives as exposition rather than through micro-choices that reveal conflicted impulses. The final step through the arch feels unmotivated by prior character work; no on-page struggle tests his commitment. The "empirically intuitive" trait is asserted but never constrains a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The queen's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("velvet robes traded for linen that whispered against her skin like regret") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation to climb is told through dream summary, not dramatized choice with visible cost. The hooded figure delivers thematic insight without the queen making a micro-choice that forecloses a path; her "trembling" at the end reads as label-only emotion. Internal conflict is asserted ("You chose power over pulse") but not shown acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist's motivations—revaluing light, forgiving Elias—are declared but lack embodied contradiction or genuine cost. Her response to his confession ("You returned... That's the revaluation") reads as therapeutic diagnosis rather than a choice forced by internal conflict. Elias's guilt is told and externalized via tears, not shown through micro-choices that alter present options. The protagonist's competence is unopposed; no blind spot or flaw complicates her alchemical forgiveness ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("feral nostalgia—not sweet longing, but rabid, snarling recollections"), with embodied emotion in key moments (the guitar chord "vibrates in my molars"). Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses—jealousy of past selves versus the drive to document chaos. However, the parade of past-self visitations feels more like a catalog than dramatized pressure that forces micro-choices; the younger selves appear, are observed, then vanish without the protagonist making decisions that alter present options until the scroll-writing itself becomes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's sensory loss is embodied through touch-mapped action and the birthing screw triggers a clear shift in her therapeutic stance. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("emotional terrain," "internal map") rather than contradiction under pressure. The final gesture toward the pregnant couple and her resolution to "listen...for what trembled beneath" feel declared rather than earned through a visible cost that forecloses another path. The motivation remains consistent but the change reads more as thematic confirmation than a choice with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interior is richly textured with contradictory impulses—scholarly rigor versus superstition, shame versus hope—and the scars function as both wound and waypoint. The transformation from brittle shell to shimmering waypoints is earned through the rune-writing sequence, though the final shift feels slightly narrated rather than fully embodied. Micro-choices (humming the lullaby when ink threatens to crystallize, revisiting dandelions and chalk sigils) anchor the internal work, but the peak moment lacks a visceral cost that would push this into higher bands. The backstory block (village superstitions) exceeds 20% but remains anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR exception criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivations are consistent—regret over her published critique and desire to apologize—and her gestures (trembling, setting down the bottle) are embodied. Internal contradiction appears in her nervousness despite her professional identity, but micro-choices feel somewhat staged: the copper coil device and manuscript reveal lack the messy hesitation promised by "imperfect miracles." Elias's reaction is credible but underdeveloped; his forgiveness arc compresses rapidly without visible internal struggle at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "unravel cosmic illusions" is established through assertion rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Interior experience relies heavily on cosmic-scale abstractions ("consciousness expanding and contracting like a lung made of spacetime") that remain conceptual rather than embodied. The final transformation—"she simply ceased to distinguish between seeker and sought"—reads as transcendence-by-declaration without visible cost or foreclosed path. Contradictory impulses are absent; the witness moves through each beat with serene certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The shepherd's motivation to understand time's true nature is asserted through internal summary rather than tested by contradictory impulses in scene. The backward counting and key-turning are presented as routine ritual without visible internal conflict or cost that would reveal character under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on philosophical abstraction ("erosion of moments," "surrender—the yielding of potential to fact") rather than embodied, particular emotion. The protagonist's twenty-three seasons and solitary dedication are told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—the flunked calculus as rebellion, the shift post-heart-attack—but her choices never narrow meaningfully on the page. The father's bedside recognition and clover exchange offer embodied emotion, yet the scrawl network operates mostly as reflection rather than forcing live trade-offs. Internal contradiction is asserted ("rebellion without responsibility") but not dramatized through simultaneous impulses in a single beat. The ending ("Begin again") reads as declaration rather than earned through a foreclosed path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The operator has a clear conceptual motivation (cultivated estrangement) but her choices feel more curatorial than conflicted—she orchestrates misroutes without internal friction or cost until the final call. The librarian, widower, teenager, chef, and painter remain sketches whose transformations are told rather than shown. The climactic self-call introduces a turn, but the operator's agency remains abstract; "began, quietly, to end her own" reads as poetic assertion rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in spinning the disc and weeping, but interiority leans toward thesis ("endings needed to be taught how to begin") rather than contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (kneeling, brushing planks, opening journal), and her internal commitment to "preserve the weight of small moments" drives consistent choices. Interiority shows some specificity ("stubborn luminescence of love preserved"), but several beats rely on abstract declaration rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she never wavers or struggles with competing desires on the page. The grandmother exists only as memory object; no second on-page character tests the protagonist's stance, limiting relational pressure. Emotional progression is smooth and reflective rather than irrational or self-deceiving under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to cure loneliness is clearly dramatized through her setup of the reciprocity table and sequential exchanges with strangers. The final beat with the moth-eaten coat man embodies her philosophy through concrete action rather than declaration. However, interiority remains somewhat distant—her "desperately jocular" trait is told rather than shown constraining choices under pressure, and the secondary characters (Mrs. Hargrove, teenage runaway, widower, barista, painter) blur into a collective rather than exerting individual pressure. The change at closure (her jocularity "softening into something quieter") lacks sufficient prior contradiction or embodied cost to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The blind mapmaker's interiority is rich with embodied perception—touching moss that "chimed like glass bells," letting vibrations climb her arm. Internal contradiction appears in "more whole, more lost, more alive," and the absorption of widow's lullaby sorrow shows layered emotional response. However, the protagonist remains fundamentally passive; the forest tests her with memories, but she merely absorbs and endures without making choices that foreclose paths or alter tactics under pressure until the final gesture of placing the ring.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is legible (threshing meaning from experience) but remains abstract throughout; concrete micro-choices under pressure are scarce. The "confidently uncertain" attribute is told repeatedly rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interior voice relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("chaff of regret," "thresher ran on broken gears") that reads more as authorial commentary than character-specific thought. The ending's stance crystallization—"stop fighting time—and start dancing with its grammar"—is told rather than earned through dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("translate silence into music") but never tested by on-page conflict or cost. Her interaction with the mute girl arrives too late to complicate prior choices, functioning as demonstration rather than struggle. Silas remains a passive observer whose "whispering advisor" label never translates into a choice that alters Elara's tactics. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through gestures without competing impulses or earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exists as a collection of poetic labels—"analytically intuitive," "lending library arsonist"—without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. Her weeping "not from grief, but recognition" exemplifies diagnostic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis. The final choice to "step into the light" carries no visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply accepts a role pre-written by ancestors, with no competing impulse dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Subject Gamma-7's interior world is vivid and contradictory—drumming as rebellion, carrying twenty-seven souls as both burden and collaboration. The motivation to "breathe life into a shared dream" arrives clearly but reads somewhat abstract; the final shift from solo suffering to collective weaver feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices that narrow options. Embodied emotion is strong in the lagoon-gazing and drumming sequences, but the climactic transformation relies on elevated metaphor ("tendrils curling," "auroras ripple") rather than a visceral, contradictory choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's defining trait (reading walks) is established early and her calibrated silence creates a distinct character. The decision to pocket the coin and later plant evidence shows agency, but the choice feels more clever than conflicted—no visible internal friction between competing impulses. The final act of slipping the map to Ruiz forecloses confrontation, which reads as Earned Stasis, but the cost (what she surrenders by not acting directly) remains implicit rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's motivation is declared poetically but never tested through contradictory impulses. Her action—weaving light—remains consistent without internal friction or visible cost to her personally. The drowned woman's smile feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle. The guardian's capability is never bounded by genuine limits that force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her choices drive the narrative, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("gardener of second chances," "forests of second thoughts") rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice of placing the grotto on the sundial is present, but her internal conflict never materializes—she moves from plan to execution without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a path. Milo's brief appearance provides a concrete outcome, yet Elira herself remains more archetype than individual, her voice indistinct from the narrator's elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"grief settles into bone like barnacles" names the state without showing simultaneous impulses in action. The whale's call triggers a vision sequence that tells us what she "saw" in summarized chunks rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure. The final paragraph pivots to new characters (fisherman's child, widow, runaway) without establishing their stakes or Lira's specific costs in those interactions; the moves feel like thematic bullet points rather than earned endurance with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's emotional void is embodied through concrete actions—whittling to erode, burning pamphlets, narrating flatly—rather than labeled. Internal contradiction appears in the performance of grief while "feeling nothing at all," and the compliance visit forces a meaningful choice that forecloses authenticity with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward diagnostic phrasing ("morally ambiguous, perhaps, to perform grief as spectacle") and the character's flaws don't genuinely complicate the final choice; compliance feels pre-determined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains abstract throughout—no concrete micro-choices under pressure, no embodied contradiction. "Tremor of certainty" is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The final action (stepping onto ice) arrives as ritual rather than earned change; no visible cost forecloses a path. Interiority consists of poetic declarations ("simple, savage need") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation—finding beauty in imperfection—is consistently embodied through his actions (arranging plants, listening to the reed tongue). His perceptual signature (textures and resonances rather than hues) shapes every choice and grounds his interiority in specifics. However, the final change feels more like recognition in Marta than earned transformation in Elias; he remains essentially static, teaching rather than changing. The body of the story shows micro-choices (choosing plants by stem stiffness, wedging the reed "just so"), but the ending lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation ("discover the texture of connection") is signaled early and sustains the pilgrimage frame, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout—"feeling the grain of each vanished voice like braille on her soul" asserts emotional texture rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. No meaningful internal conflict or on-page choice alters her stance; she performs reverent actions (striking the tuning fork, singing) without risk, cost, or foreclosed path. The weeping moment ("not from sorrow, but from recognition") is told rather than embodied, and the final clip of the lens carries no visible consequence or changed option. Apply −0.4 for diagnostic label-speak in peak beats ("Seeds of texture, of friction") and cap at 8.3 per BRR mode without present micro-choices that tilt stance.

    The maker's interiority is vivid and concrete ("grief had scraped her soul to marrow"), and her method—folding origami with coordinates—embodies her motivation with specificity. However, she remains largely alone throughout, with no on-page conflict that tests her resolve or forces a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending action (placing the locket in a crane, leaving it) reads as continuation rather than transformation; no prior impulse is renounced or altered. Backstory and reflection dominate without micro-choices that tilt present stance, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer is established through concrete, embodied detail—stained fingers, methodical work rhythms, measuring gestures—and her curiosity drives her systematic approach to mapping cultural fragments. However, her motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested under pressure; she never faces a choice that costs her something or forces a meaningful internal contradiction. The visitor at the end arrives to observe, not to challenge, so the protagonist's agency never crystallizes into a decision that forecloses a path. The final act of unspooling the measuring tape reads as continuation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's motivation (daughter's silence after massacre) is concrete and drives the journey, but her interior experience leans heavily on abstract formulations ("anguished joy," "sweetness poisoned by certainty") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic hum and palmprint choice feel earned by setup, yet the moment when she "felt lighter" edges toward diagnostic summary rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. Micro-choices (unpredictable steps, refusal to pull away) are present but the embodiment remains poetic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation to preserve hope is consistent, and her patient hunting method is character-specific. However, interiority leans heavily on elevated abstraction ("luminous regret," "hope's chrysalis") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice—embedding the stone—feels more symbolic gesture than dramatized struggle with visible cost; we don't see her wrestle with competing impulses in the moment. The "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" label does descriptive work but her agency at closure reads passive observation plus one ritual act.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is richly textured through embodied decision-making (handling the tail, mixing pigments, drafting plans), and her contradictory impulses—loyalty versus self-preservation—are present in the physical reconstruction ritual. However, the renunciation of the institution and commitment to a new sanctuary feel inevitable rather than earned through visible internal struggle; the choice arrives cleanly without a dramatized moment of competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance crystallizes persuasively, but the path to it lacks friction that would test her commitment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation to "read" scars is established and her final shift from "closure seeker" to someone who accepts continuation shows internal movement. The accidentally telepathic trait functions mostly as atmospheric color rather than a genuine constraint that forces difficult choices—the ivy "whispers" coordinates but doesn't impose cost or create friction. Interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("meteor hush," "silence stitched with awe") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The scar-merging climax arrives without visible tradeoff or renunciation that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gazer's motivation is clear and her internal process is embodied through concrete actions (pressing film to forehead, trembling fingers). However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("she became the vessel for his grief") rather than staying grounded in contradictory impulses. The final choice to mail the letters is legible but arrives without meaningful internal resistance or cost—she decides and acts without dramatized friction. The recognition moment ("she, too, had written goodbye letters") provides parallel but doesn't complicate the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is heavily abstracted through poetic metaphor ("cathedral of unfinished hymns," "stardust that clung to her soul") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation to free trapped creativity is told and summarized across paragraphs rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible tradeoffs. The climactic winter scene shows her tracing meteors and weeping, but the internal conflict—why now, what specific cost she pays, what she forfeits—remains ornamental. The change at closure (voices "released") is asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forced a choice with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dreamless guard is established with a clear engineered trait and his mission creates a dominant stake, but interiority remains abstract—his choices (pressing the chess clock, humming to charm the sphere) read as competent execution rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final softening of shoulders is told rather than dramatized through embodied micro-choices. No secondary character appears to test his stance, and the engineered dreamlessness functions as a label rather than a lived constraint that complicates his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The philosopher's interior life relies heavily on abstract declarations ("the hum of insight," "rediscover the uncharted territories within himself") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The translocation trait is mentioned but never constrains a present choice with visible cost. Motivation is told in summary ("That was his motivation, raw and unrelenting") instead of dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The final "letting go" reads as smooth epiphany without the friction of competing desires or visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ferry guides remain more symbolic presences than embodied characters with contradictory impulses. Elira and Torvin are given distinct gestures (humming, ear-to-bark listening) but these actions feel illustrative rather than pressure-driven choices that foreclose paths. The final vigil reads as thematic statement ("Courage doesn't rust") rather than earned insight from dramatized struggle. Internal conflict and embodied emotion are largely absent; the guides move through the piece without visible cost or friction that would make their stance crystallization feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bellhop's motivation is clearly rooted in trauma (nerve regeneration following a collapse triggered by sound), and his internal conflict between safety and silence drives the arc. The trembling hands when passing the piano and the choice to restore the bolt show embodied contradiction. The child's arrival forces the stake-test with visible cost. Minor: the grandmother and child function somewhat instrumentally, though the bellhop's agency remains central.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives action through the planted messages and final pellet placement. However, her interior experience remains largely abstract—"burned colder than the stars," "hollow echo of justice"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The secondary cast (librarian, scribe, general) are narrative conveniences who converge without individuated friction or resistance. The ending speech ("Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror.") tips into aphoristic declaration rather than dramatized realization, undercutting the cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is densely rendered through sensory particulars (tapping rhythms, tweezers peeling pages) and her motivation—discovering why paths vanish—drives each micro-choice. However, the mentor remains a cardboard convenience who vanishes after providing the crucial atlas page, and the rapid pivot from grief to teaching mode in the final third lacks embodied friction or visible cost. The tapping practice reads as character-particular, but the final "metamorphoses" insight lands as a stated epiphany rather than emerging through contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority leans heavily on atmospheric reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. "Awkwardly confident" is labeled but not enacted through micro-choices with visible cost. The final whisper and smile feel declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle; the shift from hollow to purposeful lacks a crystallized internal conflict that forecloses a path. The gathering of others is told through indirect means ("she felt," "she knew") rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The grandmother's motivation to evolve tradition is clear and coherent, anchored in bodily detail (gnarled fingers, creaking joints). Internal contradiction emerges through her refusal of violence paired with "quiet ferocity," and the choice to distribute rather than control the embryo's power shows earned transformation. However, the protagonist's agency is passive at the climactic moment—she offers a choice to the embryo rather than making one herself—and the telepathic plant communication, while central, never generates embodied cost or contradictory impulses that force a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied—somatic markers, phantom twinges, the pearl of stillness—but the final turn toward sketching and leaving drawings in tree hollows feels asserted rather than causally earned by prior micro-choices. The sister's memory is handled with restraint, avoiding sentimentality. Therapy-adjacent language ("somatic markers," "grounding," "pressure equals presence") borders on diagnostic label-speak but remains mostly anchored in bodily sensation. The shift from survival to "talent serves something beyond survival" is clean, though the agency behind it could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior state is vivid and particular—"crestfallen," fingers tracing broken edges, stitching with purpose—but her motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The decision to stitch fragments and step onto the tapestry reads as symbolic ritual rather than a choice with visible cost or competing wants. Emotional progression is poetic but lacks embodied contradiction; pain is declared ("Pain was the price of coherence") without showing her flinch or hesitate. No secondary character appears to test her stance, and the final transformation feels proclaimed rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tracker's motivation to understand time's hiccup is established early and drives her investigation. Her embodied interaction with the ink (pressing to temples, watching patterns) shows active experimentation. However, the final disappearance feels unmotivated—no prior contradiction or internal conflict forces this choice. The decision to vanish through ink patterns arrives without visible struggle or cost that forecloses another path; it reads more as surrender to an external force than character-driven agency.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and the final stance is earned, but interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("bravely conflicted storm within," "raw feeling") rather than embodied contradictions in action. The decision to use the Resonance Table demonstrates agency, though the path from trembling fingers to calm acceptance flattens too quickly without visible struggle. Secondary characters (Commander Veyra, the general, the poet) remain functional pressure points but lack distinct texture beyond their roles.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's character is established through concrete actions (kneeling in soil, finger-brushing stems, sheathing the knife) and her perceptual signature is distinct. The internal contradiction between her violent inheritance and chosen gentleness operates across multiple beats. However, the piece leans heavily on demonstration-through-vignette rather than a single high-pressure choice that tests competing impulses in real time. The visitor interactions provide external validation but minimal on-page friction that forces Elara to weigh costs.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fisher's cool-headedness is asserted more than dramatized under pressure; her choices feel guided by world-mechanics rather than internal contradiction. The transliteration ability reads ornamental—"maps feelings into phonemes, syllables into sonar"—without showing micro-choices or visible cost until the spike-slamming climax. Embodiment is present ("teeth ache," "bare feet whispering") but emotions remain largely label-free abstractions ("maternal fury," "acoustic wrath") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The heiress is distinctly drawn—her observational method, her grandfather's pen, her modified telescope—but her choices remain largely cerebral and preparatory rather than tested under direct pressure. The backstory (grandfather's pen, father's letter) anchors her motivation but consumes significant space without dramatized friction. Her final act (emailing evidence) reads as decisive but feels more like execution of a pre-formed plan than a choice forged in the crucible of the scene. Internal contradiction is present (solemn playfulness, grief versus surgical precision) but not enough ambiguity acts simultaneously in a single beat to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation (hushing old guilt) is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her past tattooing mistake is told in summary; the father's vanishing "into static" reads as metaphor rather than embodied consequence. The final choice to tether the glyph feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle—she simply performs the ritual without visible cost or internal resistance. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("voice cracking like thawing ice") and the epiphany arrives without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's "socially perceptive nature" is asserted but never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Her interiority leans heavily on aesthetic perception ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") without embodied contradiction or internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization—"meaning emerges not when noise ceases, but when we learn to listen through the patterns we ourselves create"—arrives as a pronouncement rather than being earned through a dramatized struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. The shift from city noise to grotto silence to acceptance of the musician's off-key tune registers as thematic assertion rather than a motivationally grounded alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's core motivation is clear and her retrocognitive trait is dramatized through her physical interaction with the tessera. However, her internal contradiction—between the gentle radical's past passivity and present steel—is told rather than shown in simultaneous action. The renaming ritual feels more thematic performance than a choice under genuine competing pressure. The magistrate's daughter-laughter moment offers a micro-choice but his arc is compressed into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost protagonist's motivation is clear but remains abstract—her drive to "lure possibility" never faces a concrete on-page dilemma that would force contradictory impulses. Interior life is heavily mediated through poetic description rather than embodied choice under pressure. The three echo-figures (woman, teenager, old man) receive only summary treatment; their transformations are told rather than dramatized with visible cost. Synesthesia functions as ornamental texture ("cerulean with flecks of brass") without constraining a single tactic or creating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority shows embodied sensation (pulse spikes, tremors, diaphragm tightening) that drives moment-to-moment choices, and her stance as "affectionate skeptic" modulates plausibly from skepticism to willowglass hope. However, key micro-choices—patching oscilloscope to synth, painting somatic glyphs—feel more like illustrated concepts than pressure-tested decisions with visible tradeoffs. The final choice to "open the studio doors" arrives as declaration rather than earned cost; we don't see what she forfeits or risks by making this pivot public.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sensory map maker is presented with a consistent perceptual signature (heat-mapping emotions, thermal data reading), and her motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" generates the climactic engagement with the fossil. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("transitional objects," "calibration," "existential") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation moment—singing through biothermal modulation—reads as executed competence without visible internal cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The hourglass turner possesses a distinct perceptual signature—viewing prophecy through buttons and echoes—with consistent interiority grounded in her ritual work. However, her character remains static throughout; she begins as a patient cataloger and ends the same way, with no internal contradiction forcing a difficult choice. The "recognition" moment when the echo speaks clearly feels declarative rather than earned through prior struggle. Agency is present in her teaching and jar-distribution, but no visible cost forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her physical state (burns, trembling hands) is embodied throughout. The choice to plant the microfilm rather than retrieve it shows agency with visible cost. However, the interiority leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("unused courage," "quiet gardener of justice") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation reads as earned but the path there is more poetic assertion than dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman's interior life is vivid and particular—"bones had grown roots into the rhythm of road and weather"—and his motivation to percolate truth is embodied through ambient awareness. However, the passenger remains a cipher; her grief is told ("sealed letter, a child's ribbon") without dramatized contradiction or micro-choices that test competing impulses. The yarn-needle exchange at closure reads as symbolic gesture rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on extended metaphor and reflection, which while atmospheric, displaces moment-to-moment choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The potter's motivation is concrete and her agency shapes the arc through deliberate choices (aligning the glass, pouring water, molding clay). Interiority is imagistic but occasionally tips into therapeutic phrasing ("surrender — it had stopped fighting entropy," "resonance — aligning with rhythms older than ruin"). Embodied emotion is present in breath and gesture, yet the final insight feels delivered rather than earned through prior contradiction or mistake. The renunciation of firing the kiln forecloses a path, though the cost reads more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gardener's motivations are grounded in grief and garden-keeping transformed into light-reflection, with the shift from brother's death to prism-placing creating a coherent arc. Interiority is often concrete ("Her own heart had been such a door once"), but the piece leans heavily on reflection without enough micro-choices under present pressure—most action is mechanical placement rather than conflicted decision. The locksmith's tooth measures pressure metaphorically but doesn't constrain a choice in real time. Embodied emotion ("knees aching, palms smudged") appears, yet peak moments slide toward abstraction ("protected vulnerability") rather than contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's interior is richly layered with embodied memory (mammoths, botanist past, reincarnation scars) and her micro-choices—pressing palms to the sundial, whispering coordinates of possible species—show contradictory impulses between mourning and midwifery. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic summary rather than moment-by-moment contradiction acting in scene. The final shift from mourner to midwife is signaled but not earned through a dramatized on-page struggle; the botanist memory provides texture but doesn't constrain a present choice with visible cost. Atomically reflective skin remains label-only and never forces a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris is established with occupation and interiority, but motivation remains abstract ("thread that connects all things") rather than lived contradiction. The transformation into temple-pulse reads as metaphorical drift rather than earned cost—no visible forfeiture of agency or relationality. Micro-choices (placing the spiral, writing names) are present but lack conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The resolution feels declared rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's core trait (cautious hope, pattern recognition) drives her counter-frequency decision, and her professional competence is balanced by genuine stakes—the tricksters adapt and she knows they'll return. Internal contradiction appears when she "allowed herself half a smile" yet remains vigilant, showing simultaneous relief and wariness. However, the interior relies heavily on告 exposition ("she'd trained for this—not with weapons, but with patience") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure, and the Tau Ceti flashback functions as credential-building rather than a present dilemma that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her claustrophobia creates embodied tension when the passage narrows. However, the final transformation—"no longer claustrophobic"—arrives without visible struggle or cost; the compass-to-chest moment substitutes declarative insight ("the key was not an object… but a truth") for a choice under pressure. The progression from physical fear to abstract liberation feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices that foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's face blindness generates a distinct perceptual mode (texture over visuals), and her methodical archival work is concrete. However, the killer's reveal depends heavily on her recognizing his "texture" through tremor and salt-stiff collar—a leap that feels more asserted than earned, since we never see her build a database of his physical markers. The final choice to collaborate lacks visible internal conflict or cost; she steps forward and offers help without dramatized hesitation or trade-off. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("justice was a courtroom abstraction") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in personal history, but her agency feels orchestrated rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The peak moment—transcribing the stanza and questioning the storm—reads as competent execution without genuine internal conflict or visible cost that narrows her options. The "nervously confident" attribute is labeled repeatedly but never dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Her great-grandfather's backstory anchors her drive, yet the resolution feels inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fiddler's interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic formulations rather than embodied choices under pressure. His decision to "recount what had happened" and "sculpt possibility" remains conceptual; the on-page action is playing music and releasing an object, without a micro-choice that forces a visible trade-off. Internal contradiction is minimal—he observes, reflects, and releases—but no competing impulse acts simultaneously in scene. The final smile and forward step arrive without a dramatized struggle that would foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation shifts from startup builder to meaning-seeker, but the arc unfolds almost entirely in retrospection and summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The polished calm reads as a sustained authorial assertion rather than embodied contradiction—he never panics during the collapse, which flattens internal conflict. The invited employees and roaming think-tank finale feel like outcomes rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("the silence between sirens") instead of concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler's motivation is established through reflection rather than micro-choices under pressure. Interior texture leans toward abstraction ("transmute sorrow into syntax") that skirts therapy-speak without fully embodying struggle. The final choice to "share" the burden and sing arrives with minimal on-page contradiction or trade-off visible before the act. The guardian's presence in the dream adds a second character, but their interaction is brief and lacks the friction that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    The druid's motivations are established—finder of lost truths confronting her own buried memories—but her transformation relies heavily on summary exposition of past relationships rather than embodied present struggle. The seed's invasion is described through abstract anatomical mapping ("roots unfurled beneath her flesh, mapping veins") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "unbending" reads as told revelation rather than a choice earned through opposing desires: she kneels, the seed awakens, and epiphany arrives without dramatized resistance or cost-visible refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("purposefully curious gaze," "precise hunger") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her scars function as symbolic conduits but never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—she proceeds unimpeded from arrival to ritual completion. The final kneeling and merging reads as mystical fulfillment without foreclosing a live option or revealing internal conflict between competing impulses. Motivation remains label-driven rather than dramatized through micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (barefoot walking, humming, pressing palms), though her interior remains more poetic than contradictory. The conflict between her method and Kael's is staged through dialogue and gesture, but Kael's transformation at the end ("Not surrender—seedling") feels abrupt, lacking the prior causality to earn the shift. The piece shows thoughtful attention to embodied emotion (resin "welling like slow tears"), yet the final reconciliation bypasses the messy middle ground where competing impulses would collide in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jasper's interior life shows clear texture—cataloging as ritual defense, emotional calibration via the speaker cloth. The ex-girlfriend's label "confidently uncertain" and the transition to "Project Echo" demonstrate internal contradiction. However, key moments lean on therapy-speak ("hadn't let himself miss," "hadn't let himself") and the final shift feels slightly summarized rather than dramatically earned through micro-choices under immediate pressure. The progression is plausible but lacks one additional embodied micro-turn to fully anchor the cost of opening up again.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding transition through patient scholarship rather than force. Her methodical nature drives concrete choices: speaking before planting, inventing the "forgiveness" sign, maintaining touching distance. Internal texture is specific ("buried three dissertations, each killed not by failure but by the terror of nearing truth"), though the backstory arrives as summary rather than pressuring a present beat. The spirit's ambition functions more as atmosphere than embodied opposition, limiting relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The librarian's interiority is abstract and thematically calibrated rather than embodied; we see poetic reflection ("joy and grief share the same forge") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices—reaching for the creel, lowering it into the pool—are performed rituals without visible internal friction or cost. The lunar attribute is declared to affect her sense of self, but no micro-choice shows this constraint shaping a decision. At the ending, she turns toward "the next creel," but no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inspector's motivation is established early ("to dissolve the walls between hearts") and her confessions show contradictory impulses—longing for connection versus envying the dead their release. Her choices escalate logically through the ritual, and the final transformation feels earned. However, interiority leans heavily on declarative summary ("She believed isolation was the true apocalypse") rather than embodied contradiction in action, and the confessions read more as ceremonial requirements than genuine character struggle with visible micro-costs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and her methodical mapping provides consistent internal logic. Embodied emotion appears in moments like weeping at the wall and cradling the accordion, but much of the interiority relies on poetic abstraction ("contour lines of shame, elevation markers of remorse") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The sister-abandonment backstory anchors the guilt, yet the final choice to "leave no note, no mark" reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The emotional progression is earnest but lacks the messy irrationality that would elevate it beyond a single-track journey.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The veiled dreamer remains abstract throughout; her choices (reaching for glyphs, documenting) feel choreographed rather than internally motivated. Interiority consists of atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The confidence man's watch provides a mechanical guide, but no genuine stakes or fear constrains her movement through the library. The final transformation into "the archive" is asserted without embodied cost or renunciation earned through prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is established (weighing truth against empire), but her interior contradiction is muted; she moves smoothly from dread to agency without visible ambivalence or cost in the deciding moment. Embodiment is present (barefoot on velvet, palm to floor) but emotional states lean toward performed gestures rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The Chancellor's transformation reads as spectacle rather than earned psychological alteration; his silent kneeling lacks the friction of prior arrogance colliding with new reverence. The micro-choice to lift the violin and sound it arrives without dramatized hesitation or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The beautician mortician's motivation is stated clearly ("to capture one last spark before oblivion"), but her internal experience remains abstract—we see her professional gestures (brushing temple, placing chip) without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The scholar is entirely passive, a canvas rather than a character applying pressure. No micro-choice visibly costs her something or forecloses a path; the ritual proceeds without friction, so the final act reads as completion of a predetermined script rather than an earned alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is dense and character-particular, grounded in embodied memory (climbing trees, broth, song). The final choice—replacing the hairpin—lands with visible cost (forgiveness releases grip on betrayal), and the gesture forecloses vindictive attachment. However, the central arc leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting *in scene*; the backstory dominates (~40% of wordcount) and micro-choices remain implicit rather than dramatized under pressure, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira's internal contradictions—the polished negotiator versus the fractured self beneath—are embodied through concrete action (unhooking the cloak, gripping cold rock). Her motivation to "welcome nuance into certainty" drives the renunciation with visible cost: shedding the cloak forecloses her old armor. Minor slip: "sincerely insincere" appears only as backstory label without on-page demonstration of the trait constraining a choice. The final shift from certainty-dealer to question-offerer feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation (teaching vanishing as emergence) is clear and her backwards-aging contradiction creates embodied stakes. However, her interior life tilts toward philosophical abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—"the weight of what she withheld" and her grief remain largely told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Kael is present but passive; his single question and bow do not reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice (his agreement to descend tomorrow) is accepted rather than wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    The skimmer remains a static figure throughout, performing observation rather than decision. Interior life is conveyed through labels ("weathered resolve," "duty as your skin") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The arrowhead is handled twice but never constrains a choice with visible cost. No agency-driven change or renunciation forecloses a path on the page—the ending restates the opening posture without dramatized alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's motivation is clear and consistent—his refusal to adapt drives the opening, and his trust-based decision to step into the mist earns the final shift. Internal contradiction appears in the hesitation ("he'd failed every trust-based ritual") but the peak choice feels somewhat announced rather than dramatized through micro-choices under immediate pressure. The weeping moment ("not for loss, but recognition") skirts diagnostic clarity but stays embodied enough. Backstory is heavy but anchored to present stimuli and primes the keystone's significance at closure.

    The lamplighter demonstrates clear motivation ("hunting the color of sound") and his final choice to lay down the ledger is earned by the discovery sequence. Interior states are embodied through physical action (diving, grasping, surfacing) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the protagonist remains fundamentally reactive—events unfold *to* him (woman slips key, ledger reveals his name) rather than being driven by his micro-choices under pressure. The pre-signed vow reduces agency; he's discovering a predetermined path rather than forging one through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—wavelength alignment with purpose—is embodied through her lot-casting ritual and her physical relationship with the coins, creating a consistent character-specific logic. Internal contradiction emerges when she stops drawing lots and chooses independently, marking genuine change. However, the epiphany about "futures she'd lived and forgotten" arrives without sufficient on-page causality; the shift from surrender to agency feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that visibly narrow her options.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper's interior life is dense with embodied grief ("frost," "hollow between heartbeats"), and the naming ritual dramatizes his stance shift from passive mourner to active memory-keeper. Motivation is clear and intensifies across beats. However, the transformation from "heartbroken" to "heart-carrier" feels asserted rather than earned through a visible on-page choice that forecloses a path; the final smile lacks prior resistance or trade-off to charge it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mage's interiority is highly specific—"tepid aura of someone perpetually unsure if he'd remembered to close the oven"—and his obsessive methodology embodies contradictory impulses (cosmic ambition vs. humble means). His final choice to release the bell is earned by months of patient observation, foreclosing further intervention with visible cost (he walks away content but barefoot and lukewarm). Minor penalty: the emotional arc is slightly too smooth; we never see him doubt or wrestle with failure during the attempt itself, only gentle confirmation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation and agency throughout, moving from documenting to honoring memory with visible cost ("They assigned him permanently...not as warden of the levee, but as archivist"). His interiority is concrete in key moments ("the label trembling in his palm"). However, the transformation lacks sufficient embodied contradiction—he pivots from expunging to preserving with minimal on-page internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Secondary characters (locals, supervisor) remain functional placeholders without applying meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist remains more archetype than individual; her "secret sentimentality" is asserted through narrated journal entries rather than enacted choices that carry visible cost. Internal contradiction is present ("not as scientist, but as child") but operates as toggle rather than simultaneous pressure. The final transformation moment lacks a concrete forfeiture—she gains communion without dramatized loss of rigor or method.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation—preserving trust through vigilance—is concrete and constrains her choices consistently. Her muscle-memory signal system (buckle as communication code) embodies her method without diagnostic label-speak, and the final choice to re-clip the buckle and walk toward the next arbor demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in her balancing of truth-telling versus reassurance, shown through the remembered village failure. Minor slips: the mentor backstory occupies ~15% without altering present tactics significantly, and some interiority leans toward summary ("she had learned that the hard way") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation—defeating numbness through balance—is legible and drives his stillness-as-agency at closure. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("the prison of identity," "complementary opposites") rather than embodied contradiction; the moment of ego death is told as release rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The duplicate brain's voice ("I remember your pain. I do not want to inherit it") lands cleanly, but Kael's smile and warmth return without visible micro-choices showing the shift—cost is declared more than felt. Students Lira and Torvin apply pressure but remain functional rather than distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's grief is embodied through concrete ritual (the gutted leaf blower, pull cord handle as rosary), and his motive—restoring lost laughter—drives each beat. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic register ("macerates grief," "fractures into harmonics only the hollow can hear") that distances rather than grounds emotional stakes. The daughter's illness is told rather than dramatized, and the neighbors' judgment remains offstage summary. Micro-choices are present (holding the pull cord "just so," dropping to his knees) but the accumulation feels more decorative than pressure-driven, and the final choice to "begin again" reads as restatement rather than earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's interiority is concrete and distinctively embodied through physical anchors—swallowing landscapes, frost-shimmer fur, licking frozen cheeks. Interior contradiction appears ("not with patience, but with the hollow ache") and the final choice to offer its paw is motivated by the transmutation arc. However, the epiphany about uncertainty as compass/lens arrives more through poetic assertion than earned dramatic cost; the moment when it "simply waited—patient now, not hollow" tells the shift rather than shows a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elric's motivation (to interrupt stifling destiny) is clear and shapes his turn to error-embracing methodology. The iterative adjustment ("Too sharp," "Too slow") shows micro-choices under pressure. However, interiority leans on abstract formulations ("collision as the only path to rebirth," "the seed beneath could stretch") rather than embodied perception, and the final change reads as philosophical declaration more than lived cost. The bruised-violet eyes and "stoically sensitive" trait remain label-only without constraining a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to find the beginning in every ending") is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—unrolling the coil, placing the fragment, tuning—read as competent execution without visible struggle or internal contradiction. The moment of understanding ("It was a mirror") arrives as assertion rather than earned realization tied to prior on-page costs. Embodied emotion is largely absent; labels like "serenely electric" and declarative insights ("she understood then") replace contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The deckhand's motivation ("resiliently positive," cheerful despite catastrophe) is asserted through repeated smiling and grinning but never tested by genuine internal conflict or competing impulses. His choice to enter the grotto and tune the radio reads as confidence in a mystical solution rather than a trade-off with visible cost. The captain's return is passive (he simply appears), and the deckhand's final state mirrors his opening cheer without dramatizing what he has risked or lost. Interiority relies on label-only optimism ("resiliently positive," "cheerful wave") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The architect's motivation ("to discover the texture of connection") is told rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("rational enchantment," "grammar of consciousness") that reads as concept rather than embodied thought. The protagonist moves through the gallery without meaningful internal contradiction or struggle—she is "calm" and confident throughout, never facing a decision that costs her something or forces competing impulses to clash in scene. The ending gesture of releasing the thread feels like a philosophical conclusion rather than an earned choice shaped by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her trait of "balanced curiosity" is gestured at through the First Contact backstory, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The classroom beats show professional competence without internal contradiction or struggle that would force difficult micro-choices. The anchor chain link moment offers a promising gesture toward embodied reflection, but the subsequent lecture feels like exposition of character thesis rather than discovery under pressure. No meaningful cost or renunciation is dramatized; she teaches, reflects, and continues teaching with identical confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tracer's specialized expertise and persistent curiosity are established early, though her interiority relies heavily on exposition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The girl's grief is embodied effectively through physical staging ("knees drawn to chest, eyes wide and unblinking"), but the tracer's emotional arc remains steady without internal friction. The final choice to guide the girl feels inevitable rather than wrought from competing needs. Backstory exposition about the parents' fire exceeds the allowance and flattens present tension.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    The spelunker's claustrophobia is embodied early ("live wire sparking against stone") and her motivation—honoring the unremembered—is specific and drives the descent. However, the protagonist remains largely reactive; she executes a predetermined plan without internal conflict or a moment where competing impulses force a difficult trade-off. The final choice to linger among the flickering figures feels more contemplative than costly, and the overcoming of claustrophobia in the ending ("unafraid of tight spaces") arrives as assertion rather than earned transformation through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's interiority shows specificity—the heartbeat counting, the porcelain shard as tactile tether—but his motivation remains largely asserted rather than contradictory or tested under pressure. The "reluctant medium" stance is told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Embodied emotion is present (breath fogging, barefoot cold) but the peak moment with Dr. Voss's voice offers wisdom without visible cost to Aris's choices. Internal contradiction acting simultaneously is absent; he moves smoothly through his mission without genuine struggle that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The storyteller is defined by external traits (copper veins, articulate speech) and stated motivation, but interiority remains abstract. Her decision to use the diamond and speak the language is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle or contradictory impulses. The weeping moment offers embodied emotion, but the arc from waiting to speaking lacks visible internal conflict that would make the choice costly. No secondary characters apply pressure; the flock and canyon function as setting rather than relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to release the Gravity Dancer and transmute bitterness is stated but her interior contradictions remain abstract—the "bitterness" is listed (academic scorn, exile, weeping) rather than embodied in present-scene choices under pressure. The final transformation reads asserted ("Elara, no longer undercover, no longer bitter, walked lighter than air") without a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Moira remains a functional catalyst without distinct pressure or status friction. The piece relies heavily on elaborate backstory and cosmic metaphor in place of on-page micro-choices that reveal character hierarchy under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The violinist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her internal experience remains abstract—"grief," "trembling"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation of the statues happens *to* them via her music rather than through her wrestling with doubt or cost; she never falters, questions, or pays a visible personal price that forecloses a path. The ending gift of the apple feels like reward without renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mailman's motivation is clear—hunting for "where broken promises heal"—and his profession as a linking-absences courier is well-established through concrete action (carrying the bottle, activating the drone). However, his interior life relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("stitching together the absences") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice to send the storm lacks genuine on-page struggle; he proceeds smoothly through logistics with Marla, never hesitating or weighing competing goods. "Respectfully rebellious" is told via border-guard summary rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carpenter's motivation is established—silence as native tongue, interpretation as goal—but remains largely abstract. His decision to restore the carousel follows naturally from his craft identity, yet the internal contradiction needed for high marks is absent; he encounters no meaningful resistance to his choice. The "song" of hands and tools offers embodied emotion, but the stakes feel predetermined rather than tested. The change at closure (completing the carousel) reads as fulfillment rather than transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian's interior life is specific and embodied through sensory detail (chalk-dust tang, scarf texture), but her choices lack visible cost. The final act of singing to story-orbs feels unmotivated—no prior beat dramatizes why this action matters to her beyond abstract mission fulfillment. The grandmother's backstory anchors motive but the protagonist's present stakes (what she personally risks or loses) remain abstract. Embodiment is strong; causal pressure on her choices is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian's motivation is clear and consistent—reclaiming the runaway dream—but her agency at closure feels thin: the palette spontaneously gathers the exact light she needs, and the dream simply unfurls without meaningful resistance or trade-off on her part. Interiority remains largely abstract ("heart quiet," "obsessive") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final reunion lacks visible cost; she "closes the palette, not to store, but to savor," but we don't see what path this forecloses or what she sacrifices to hold this translucent presence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith remains entirely abstracted—no contradiction between impulse and restraint, no embodied emotion beyond label-only gestures ("felt it in his marrow"). His mission is declared but never tested by a competing need or cost on the page. The mirrors "weep" and "plead," yet he "simply" reaches for a ribbon without struggle, marking a choice without visible friction or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The folklorist's chronic curiosity is embodied through tactile action ("fingers brushed," "boots-muddy, notebook-stained") and drives her surgical motivation to recover stolen memories. Her months of charting stellar aberrations against ship logs demonstrates competence balanced with genuine struggle. The final choice—to stay and feed the orchard—feels earned by her established relentlessness, though the smile at the end slightly undercuts the visceral cost of this renunciation. Internal contradiction between recovery drive and curiosity-as-habit operates clearly in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist's motivation—to teach "how to hold broken things without cutting themselves"—is concrete and drives her combative pedagogy. Her walking backwards under stress embodies internal conflict, and the cartographer interaction shows micro-choices (sliding the tea cup, annotating margins) that reveal hierarchy of values. However, the reversible exile mechanism remains abstract; the threat that "the stacks may exhale her into the void" lacks embodied stakes that force a peak choice with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—she "could not bear a world without that shimmer"—but her interiority remains static and leans on elevated abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The weaving scene demonstrates agency through micro-choices (selecting memories, tracing arcs), yet emotional progression is smooth and affirmed rather than conflicted; no genuine mistake or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. Backstory fragments (grandmother's lullaby, first kiss, apprentice's graft) anchor present action but inflate to near 25% without creating friction or a pivot that alters her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The restorer's motivation is clear and her methodology consistent throughout, with embodied action (needle work, physical positioning) grounding the POV. Internal contradiction appears minimally—she operates with certainty and competence, never doubting her ritual. The fisherman's confession provides a brief secondary voice, but the protagonist herself displays no meaningful struggle between competing impulses; her reverence deepens but never wavers. The final choice to continue her work is presented as inevitable rather than earned through on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and well-anchored in childhood memory, establishing concrete emotional stakes. Interior experience shows specificity ("not gaps to be filled, but presences to be acknowledged"), though the actual choices on the page trend passive—she observes, interpolates, waits—without a moment where contradictory impulses force a visible tradeoff. The weeping at recognition and the yarrow-leaving gesture feel earned by prior causality, but the path to closure is contemplative rather than agonistic, limiting upper-band access.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's "quietly analytic" stance is embodied through concrete observation (patterns in the snow globe, spectral analyses) and the relationship with death as "first-name basis acquaintance" shapes micro-choices throughout. The sister's absence drives the emotional arc credibly, and the final release—opening palms, stepping back—earns the shift through accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the Amelia interiority ("You're trying to solve grief like a theorem") reads slightly over-articulated for a hallucination, though it remains character-consistent. The choice to let go forecloses possession with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The balladeer's interiority is consistently filtered through a lyric lens ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"), but her motives remain abstract—loneliness and the need to be heard are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The ghost interaction proceeds smoothly without internal friction or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final choice to "build a bridge" feels like thematic intention rather than an earned stance crystallization shaped by prior on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is conveyed through poetic assertion rather than physical contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    The servant remains observant throughout but agency is minimal—she climbs, reads, and reflects without facing a meaningful internal contradiction or cost that alters her trajectory. Emotion is largely told through poetic labels ("affectionate detachment," "warmly inquisitive") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The "trembling" and "tears that hover" gesture toward feeling but stay decorative; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of competing values with visible cost. The final acceptance is asserted, not earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The meteorologist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied grief ("not in shouts or shattered glass, but in the way she'd stare at an empty chair and feel the air crackle"). Internal contradiction operates throughout—"quietly explosive" as self-description, pressure held beneath surface—and the final smile emerges with visible cost ("not because the pain was gone, but because she'd proven"). The backstory of the broken violin string anchors present micro-choices (each cloud classification, the act of memorializing), though the piece leans heavily reflective; the spooled-wholeness method and the ledger entries function as micro-choices that tilt present stance. Minor slip: some interiority edges toward articulate self-diagnosis ("That was the hypothesis she staked her sanity on"), though it remains within the character's analytical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's face blindness is rendered with specificity—she perceives "textures" and "pressure" rather than features—and drives her unique ability to decode the coin. Her motivation (mirroring the sky before demolition) is irrational and sacred, grounded in years of study. The midway revelation that her blindness is "not a barrier, but a lens" lands cleanly and reweights her self-perception with visible cost (years believing it a deficit). Minor slip: the laugh and smile feel slightly performed rather than contradictory under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen's curiosity is embodied through concrete micro-choices (tracing the hopscotch, cross-referencing charts), and his motivation is consistent. However, the trait "diligently curious" is largely told through narrative assertion rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to share the discovery feels inevitable rather than costly, and no genuine renunciation or foreclosed path appears on the page. Internal conflict is absent; Arlen succeeds without visible struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith's motivation is stated clearly ("to understand why some breaks cannot be mended") but her interior remains abstract—labeled emotions ("anticipation," "full-hearted") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The mirrors show past moments, yet these function as exposition rather than forcing present decisions that foreclose paths. The final departure reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost; we're told she's "no longer a locksmith chasing prophecy" without dramatizing what she renounces or gains on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elira lacks embodied interiority—her ghost status becomes an excuse for generic "strangely trustworthy" labels without internal contradiction or struggle. The settlers (Kael, Liora) are sketched with occupation tags but make no micro-choices under pressure; their acceptance of Elira's plan arrives pre-decided. The final moment ("her purpose fulfilled not in arrival, but in the walking together") reads as thesis statement rather than earned change with visible cost. Motivation remains abstract orchestration without on-page friction or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The adjuster remains a cipher executing a predetermined ritual without internal contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure. His "scarred fingers" and "crystallized tears" are label-only traits never dramatized as constraints. The puppet's smile and resonance are asserted repeatedly but never tied to a micro-choice that alters his tactics. The piece offers no embodied emotion—only elevated declarations ("bruised awe") that float above concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The caretaker's resignation and refusal to let the chorus grow are consistently embodied through action—dragging heels, dislodging pebbles—rather than stated. His handing the nut to the girl and turning back demonstrate endurance with visible cost (foreclosing connection, accepting isolation). Minor slip: "offhandedly exact in his weariness" edges toward label-speak at the closure beat, though the prior moves earn it. Internal contradiction (hates the silence / refuses more ghosts) drives choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chemist's interior journey from blame to acceptance is embodied through physical action (kneeling, scooping foam, sketching). The shift from "blaming the hospital, the diagnosis, the brittle polymer scaffold" to seeing it as "temporary architecture" is earned by concrete observation rather than assertion. However, the daughter's characterization exists only in reflection without contradictory impulses complicating the present mourning. The insight "separation wasn't failure / It was phase change" reads as therapeutic label-speak that slightly flattens the peak realization.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The vendor is established through ritual and transaction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her backstory ("daughter, debtor, deserter, dreamer") is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The customers appear as abstract symbols rather than individuals who force choices; their interactions are static exchanges without visible friction. The final "lighter" claim tells emotional state rather than embodying it through concrete action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's ability to taste memories is concretely rendered through "a doorknob might sting with betrayal; a spoon could hum with childhood warmth," and her glove removal marks a clear micro-choice under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily toward metaphorical abstraction ("sandpaper rough memories," "armor herself with ritual") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation—"hollowed but whole"—reads more as declared epiphany than earned paradox with visible cost tied to a specific renunciation. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("emotionally contagious," "subsume") in peak beats nudges the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is characterized primarily through her title and mission statement rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "empathetically decisive" nature is asserted but never tested by competing goods or unavoidable harms; she succeeds without visible struggle or foreclosed paths. The grain elevator's voice is more stylized than motivated—it shifts languages fluently without dramatized constraint. Interiority relies heavily on elevated diction ("celestial maps that whispered guidance") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The engineer's interiority is heavily abstracted through metaphor ("synaptic terrain," "neural recalibration") rather than embodied emotion. The "modify" action repeats as assertion without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The mentor's quoted wisdom and the child's recovered memory provide backstory texture, but the protagonist's own transformation reads as declared ("she understood") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. The final walk away carries intent but no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's "prism-minded" trait remains largely label-only; her fractured cognition is asserted but never constrains a choice or creates visible tradeoff. Internal conflict is absent—she progresses smoothly through escalating magical challenges without doubt, fear, or competing impulses. The ending grants her the Seed with no visible cost or renunciation, reducing her arc to competent puzzle-solving. Embodied emotion is sparse; moments like "heart hammering" are generic physiology rather than character-specific sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation to restore sound is clear and his listening-as-craft is specific, but his interior contradictions remain abstract. The final tears are labeled ("not from sorrow, but from recognition") rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The hedgehog functions as ornament rather than applying pressure. Embodied emotion is present in "fingers plucking invisible strings" but the peak moment relies on explanation rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tutor's interiority is concrete and his motivation—seeking beauty in difficulty—is embodied through the worry stone's tactile presence and his meditation on silence. Internal contradiction surfaces in his oscillation between palace memories and present exile, though the peak choice to "translate silence into strategy" and walk toward the treeline remains more declarative than dramatized under visible cost. The phrase "hopeful melancholy" skirts diagnostic label-speak but remains just within voice; however, the final decision lacks a lived tradeoff on the page—no pupils wait, no concrete forfeiture anchors the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to catalog silence is clearly articulated, and her dedication is visible in the workshop details. However, the character remains at emotional distance—her interiority consists largely of technical observations and declarative claims ("empathy wasn't taught—it was recovered") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The war-torn village memory tells us about her commitment but doesn't dramatize an on-page micro-choice under pressure. The ending stance feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle; she "stood unmoved" without visible internal friction or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority is vivid and specific—her olfactory sensitivity shapes perception throughout. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract: her "ambition for serenity within motion" is stated but never pressured by a contradictory impulse acting in scene. The closure choice (replanting with doodles) feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong in the bloom scene ("tears streaming not from disgust, but recognition"), but the recognition itself arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority is vivid and concrete ("Her breath caught," "She wept"), and her micro-choices under pressure (touching the arrow, sprinting to the Grandmother Canopy) drive the narrative. However, the transformation from pilot-who-fixes to listener-who-echoes feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene; the final stance arrives without visible internal resistance or cost. The embodied emotion is strong, but the arc lacks the friction required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The investigator's interiority is concrete and purposeful—touching the patch, mapping vectors, interpreting wind as adversary—but remains operationally one-note throughout. The protagonist's internal contradiction (rational measurement versus anthropomorphizing the wind as a learning entity) never acts simultaneously in scene; it alternates in summary. The final choice to step into the wind's path reads as symbolic rather than a stakes-altering decision with visible cost. Varga's patch functions more as atmospheric anchor than a driver of micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bell ringer's synesthetic gift is described but rarely shown constraining choices under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory labels ("taste the G-minor as burnt caramel") rather than embodied contradiction. The final walk-away feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Motivation remains consistent but the arc reads more as ceremonial performance than a character wrestling with conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is concrete and specific—harvesting insights from failure rather than restoration—and her scholarly precision emerges through embodied micro-choices (calibrating driftwood angles, notebook documentation). Internal contradiction shows when precision trembles not from fear but exactitude, yet the piece leans heavily reflective with ~40% devoted to backstory/context of the collapse. The final renunciation (leaving the flute, becoming a keeper of thresholds) feels earned by her meticulous autopsy work, though the turn relies more on accumulative witnessing than a sharp on-page dilemma. Interiority remains particular to an archivist's mindset without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exists as a conceptual figure rather than a psychologically embodied person. Interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical poses ("deliberate ambiguity," "transposed empathy") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final walk into darkness reads as allegorical closure without earned causality—no prior choice sequence makes this renunciation necessary or costly on the page. Motivation remains declared ("hunger—the gnawing need to map the unmappable") but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courier's interiority is vivid and character-particular, with embodied contradictions—trembling "not from cold but from the weight of his absence"—and the micro-choice at the fork (choosing Hollow Market "not for efficiency, but because its lanterns flickered like dragonfly wings") reflects a hierarchy of values. However, the mentor's influence operates primarily through memory rather than dramatized internal conflict acting *in scene*, and the final release of the pendant reads as pre-decided rather than wrung from competing impulses. The child encounter materializes suddenly without enough resistance to charge the courier's choice with visible cost; we see generosity but not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mystic's motivation (proving objects absorb emotion) is clear, but her actions lack genuine internal conflict or cost. She observes, records, and walks away without any contradictory impulses or stakes-driven choice that forecloses a path. The "borrowed coat" metaphor and decision not to publish feel asserted rather than earned through prior pressure. Embodied emotion is present in places ("fingers numb but steady") but the protagonist remains too controlled, never genuinely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The spinner's motivation is clear and her final choice—weaving herself into the tapestry—is earned by the amber bead's warmth and the puzzle's revelation. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("raveling silence," "gravity of latent sacrifice") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The sacrifice itself is told through lyric summary ("With each shuttle throw, a piece of her dissolved—memories of his laugh") rather than dramatized micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The man's brief recognition scene at the end provides emotional closure but his interior remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlo's motivation is clear and consistent—coaxing resilience from rubble—but his interiority remains abstract and poetic rather than embodied. The text tells us he is "meek" and "quietly determined" yet his inner life never contradicts itself or reveals genuine struggle; he moves through the narrative without facing a dramatized choice that costs him something visceral. The villagers and child are present but apply no interpersonal pressure; they receive rather than complicate. The final shift—"He had become the barter"—is asserted rather than earned through a visible internal calculus or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her occupation is established, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. Internal contradiction is minimal—she moves through the sequence with practiced ease, never genuinely torn between options. The final realization ("some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible") lands as an epiphany but lacks embodied cost that forecloses a live path on the page. The weeping reads as label-only emotion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is consistently characterized through grief-shaped silence and ritual tending, with the sea glass anchor providing concrete embodiment. His choices to deliver letters, arrange stones, and continue humming show agency, though the internal contradictions remain somewhat static rather than acting simultaneously in scene. The final turn toward louder humming suggests earned movement, but the change feels more declared than dramatized through prior pressure. Motivation is clear and the backstory integration serves the present stance, yet the peak moments lack the visceral embodied conflict that would elevate to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    The herald remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses act in scene, no micro-choices under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of poetic declarations ("Not chaos. Catalyst.") rather than embodied thought degrading under stress. The final gesture (blowing a kiss, waiting) reads as posture without visible cost or foreclosed path. Motivation is asserted in elevated register but never tested by a dramatized trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dye master's interiority is vivid and embodied—"the quiet explosion of insight that comes when patience detonates" shows her particular way of thinking. The borrowed heart creates genuine internal contradiction that drives her search, though the motivation sometimes tilts toward abstract inquiry rather than visceral need. Micro-choices (stealing the wing, tracking sun trails daily, finally infusing her own tears) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final act of creating responsive fabric and choosing not to explain represents earned renunciation with visible cost, though the leap from observation to creation could be more causally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The worker's interior texture is distinct—arboreal motivation, patience over force—and the choice to follow the sextant rather than fix it carries cost. However, the astronomer's vanishing and the worker's transformation into "cartographer of witnessed sorrow" arrive through exposition rather than embodied struggle; the final choice feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices (setting the sextant down, whispering "Show me") advance pressure, but the protagonist's arc relies on received understanding rather than friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper's scattered-memory state is labeled throughout but rarely constrains a present choice with visible cost. Her motivation to rekindle the realm is declared, yet the hum she initiates feels passive—others join spontaneously without friction or trade-off visible on her part. The final shift from "keeper of fragments" to "loom" is asserted rather than earned through contradiction or renunciation that forecloses a prior path. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure remain thin; the piece leans on atmospheric description over dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's compassionate recluse archetype is richly detailed through her empathetic attunement to books and her seven-winter exile, but her interior contradictions remain mostly narrated rather than dramatized in scene. The final act—smoothing the invitation, whispering her name, seating herself atop the ladder—shows micro-choices that reweigh her stance, yet the emotions are frequently labeled ("shame and fury," "enlarged tranquility") rather than embodied. The cost of self-acceptance is visible in the invitation she once crumpled, but the struggle to reach that acceptance unfolds largely in reflective summary, weakening the felt pressure of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is consistently rendered through embodied perception—fingers brushing archway, kneeling by fountain—and her motivation (seeking permission from earth to feel sacred) drives her micro-choices. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between grief-as-wallpaper and active resistance through seed-planting, though the contradiction could press harder at closure. The "uncloaking" moment reads more symbolic than psychologically costly; removing a shawl doesn't foreclose a live option with visible stakes. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and grounds in concrete sensory anchors, keeping the voice character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's "gently meticulous" trait is embodied in concrete gestures (feather precision on calibration knobs, never disturbing frost unless necessary) and her existential motivation is dramatized through her work rather than merely stated. However, her interiority remains largely within a single register—reverent determination—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure moments. The tears-from-awe moment late in the piece feels closer to performed emotion than embodied contradiction, and no genuine mistake or blind spot complicates her flawless execution. The ending gesture ("You are remembered") lands as an earned ritual, but the lack of internal friction or a visible cost that forecloses a path keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied through the watch fob, her surveillance tactics, and her micro-choices under pressure. Her "curiously steadfast grace" manifests in calculated retreats and misdirections, though the trait itself reads more as authorial observation than character-particular contradiction. The two failed prior attempts (apprentice, fortune-teller) provide useful stakes and demonstrate adaptive thinking. Interior life is somewhat thin—the girl remains more cipher than contradictory consciousness—but her final choice to walk away is earned by the pattern of listening rather than fighting.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated early but remains abstract—she wants to "understand why" people carry weather, yet this desire never forces a concrete choice with visible cost. The man's emotional arc (carrying memories as storm) is more grounded, but he arrives late and his "readiness" to surrender lacks prior resistance. Internal contradiction is minimal; the skeptic's doubt "unravels" without dramatized struggle. The final "trust" feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The artist's mnemonic gift and charcoal-stained fingers are established early, but interiority relies heavily on summary ("mnemonically gifted, yes, but cursed to hoard memories like tombstones") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final choice to release the portraits feels thematically necessary but lacks visible cost—she gains sovereignty without forfeiting a live option or relationship on the page. The father's lock and her childhood self function more as symbolic vehicles than pressure points that force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The calligrapher's wilting trait creates consistent pressure and her motivation is clear, but her interiority remains largely observational rather than torn by contradictory impulses. The final shift—from seeking to becoming archive—is stated rather than earned through a dramatized internal struggle with visible cost. Minor supporting characters (child, sleepers) are ornamental; the piece functions as a solo journey through accumulative discovery without meaningful relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bell tuner remains a static emblem rather than a character making choices under pressure. Her seventeen seasons of silence and her craft are declared, not dramatized through contradictory impulses or escalating decisions. The child encounter offers a single micro-choice (kneeling, placing hand), but no internal conflict or visible cost shapes that moment. Motivation is asserted ("preservation—not of objects, but of perception") without on-page friction between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The android's nostalgic coding and inner static create a consistent emotional core, and the embodied roses/burning provide concrete physicality. The transformation arc from fragmented to whole is earned through the controlled burn sequence. However, the caretaker's decision-making feels predetermined rather than conflicted—it "knew this was the moment" without visible hesitation or cost that would elevate the choice. The final turn toward the nursery wing arrives as thematic assertion rather than a choice that forecloses another live path.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority reads as conceptually clear—her method of "hearing" objects and curating catharsis—but her choices arrive through perception rather than visible cost or trade-off. Leo's grief is embodied ("gaunt, eyes hollow, clutching a mug of cold tea"), yet the humming ritual unfolds without internal friction or contradiction in either character. The final weeping is triggered by object and environment, not by a decision that forecloses a path. Competence (Elara always succeeds) and gentle omniscience ("She'd learned long ago…") flatten genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is poetically stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or a moment where she must choose between fragility and armor. Her "calm defiance" remains a declared trait rather than an embodied struggle; we see choreographed competence (pirouettes that trigger vents, dice that summon submersibles) but no genuine friction between her stated mission and her choices. The final dance that collapses the mainframe and "rewrites" her is abstract; we cannot trace what she sacrifices or forecloses, so the cost reads ornamental. The mother's lullaby and seven lunar cycles are told backstory without on-page micro-choices that tilt present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and sustained—her cataloging of anomalies and mapping of distortions show active investigation rather than passive observation. Her agency drives the closure: she interprets the coffee-ground pattern, places the aster, and chooses to step through. Internal conflict is present in the grief-driven quest, though the piece leans more on atmospheric contemplation than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final reunion feels earned by her methodical pursuit, though the father's motivations remain opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The summoner's interior is largely passive observation with minimal embodied contradiction. Her motivation—"to cradle the sky's forgetting until it remembered itself"—arrives as declared epiphany without prior friction or cost-laden micro-choices. Seventeen nights of bare-footed walking establish habit but not conflicted impulse; the climactic "cradle" gesture is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live path. The piece leans on label-only interiority ("resolve," "quiet purpose") where embodied sensation would anchor agency.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to learn building language is established early, but her interior life remains largely ornamental—tracing moss, folding origami—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The weekly tea ritual with the archivist shows relationship pressure, yet their dynamic never forces a choice that alters their state until the final exchange, which arrives as reveal rather than earned turn. The final acceptance of the key reads as information transfer, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; no diagnostic label-speak, but also no visceral stakes that compel higher-risk choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and voice-motivated ("charmed skeptic," "alchemy," "sovereignty"), with embodied moments ("dread pooling in her ribs," "vines curled gently around her ankles"). However, the piece leans heavily on abstract interiority ("geometries of grief, lattices of longing") that hovers near label-speak, and the final shift to "sovereign" reads more asserted than earned through a concrete prior struggle. Micro-choices (placing the shell, whispering the vow) are present but do not foreclose a legible path with visible cost—she arrives already resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and signaled early, but her interiority reads as summary more than embodied contradiction. The arc from "master calligrapher" to "calligraphy forger" to absolver is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice—rewriting the scroll—is prepared but not tested by competing impulses in scene. Emotion is largely labeled ("trembling not from fear but from the weight") rather than shown through perception or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to understand echoes is signaled early and her final choice—singing to the entity rather than destroying it—tracks character. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract poeticism ("weight of a question that had hollowed her") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shell-triggered revelation structure unfolds passively through progressive disclosure instead of active wrestling with options. The final stance feels predetermined rather than forged under pressure, and embodied emotion remains thin across peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is established through selective attention (snow globe warmth, dream-mapping), but her motivation to "salvage something pure" remains largely asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses under pressure. The child ghost's desire is rendered through cameos, not dramatized conflict. The final act—placing the globe in the ice frame—feels like ritual completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost; the whisperer walks away unchanged, her methods validated without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The philosopher's motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" is stated but not dramatized through on-page choices that test or complicate it. Her actions—whistling, walking, holding the whisk—are observational rituals without internal conflict or visible cost. The widow anecdote is told retrospectively rather than creating present tension. Interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("hidden patterns," "unseen hands") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interior life relies heavily on label-speak ("thrill of near-discovery," "smiled, not in triumph, but in sorrow") and abstract assertions about her mission rather than embodied tension. The walking-and-thinking structure creates a passive frame where discoveries happen *to* her rather than through resistant choices. No meaningful cost or foreclosed path is visible; she simply continues walking with new coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her stance crystallizes at the end through action (the broadcast), but her interior remains abstract—labels like "variant allegiance" and "fidelity to the broken" operate as thesis rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to broadcast feels telegraphed rather than wrestled with; no moment shows competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her renunciation of Kael reads as a posed contrast rather than a lived cost, and the final act carries declarative weight without visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation to "become the translator between generations" is established through reflection but lacks on-page micro-choices that test competing impulses. His interaction with the child near the end finally dramatizes a key value (giving back wonder), but the internal contradiction between survival and redemption is told more than enacted. The progression from "survival wasn't enough" to leaving anonymous jars reads as summary rather than pressure-tested choices. Embodied emotion is thin; much of the interior reads as philosophical narration rather than contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract declaration ("logically emotional to her marrow") rather than embodied contradiction. Her emotional states are told through elevated register ("trembled with awe," "grief, her love for the sea") that reads as performed rather than experienced under pressure. The climactic choice to sing/vibrate lacks visible cost or internal resistance—she adapts seamlessly without struggle, flattening what should be a high-stakes moment. Micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent; she moves through beats without hesitation or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mapper's motivation is abstractly asserted ("patient revolution," "sculpt patience from impatience") rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent—she never wavers, doubts, or makes a visible trade-off on the page; the text recounts her method in summary rather than dramatizing a difficult pivot. Emotions are generic ("wonder," "thanks") and lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending simply reaffirms the premise without alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The investigator's interiority is handled through concrete sensory filtering (the lantern's "cold iron biting her palm") and her stance is consistent—watchfully calm, empirical—but motivation remains abstract. "To break free from the lie that progress requires amnesia" is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. The worker's death and her decision to leave the lantern feel like plot mechanics rather than choices that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("throat tight," "shoulders aching") but not enacted through competing desires that force a visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Elias is well-motivated by guilt and grief, with his patient, methodical work embodied through concrete action. His interior reflection stays rooted in present stimuli (light through the window, the heart's mechanism) and drives micro-choices. The final shift from self-condemnation to grace feels earned by the mechanical breakthrough, though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulated insight rather than pure embodiment at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Zeta's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("curiosity was her rudder, her compass, her anti-grav stabilizer"), and her micro-choices are clear throughout the transliteration sequence. However, the motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through internal conflict—she never wavers or wrestles with competing impulses. The final slump and sketching of modifications show endurance but no visible foreclosure of path or earned transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The memory keeper demonstrates consistent interiority around her obsessive investigation, with embodied detail in the patch-tracing opening and the brightly attentive stance. Internal conflict exists between official taxonomy duties and ghost-hunting, though the tension remains conceptual rather than forcing difficult on-page choices with visible cost. The final move—wearing the patch, listening to silences—reads as Earned Stasis but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses force a decision that forecloses a path. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("descent into something deeper, older, colder") that abstracts rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    The peacekeeper's motivation is established through extended reflection rather than on-page contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation from library-hiding girl to witness is told retrospectively; the mirror scene offers a single crystallizing moment but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on abstract constructions ("courage that had shattered inside her") and therapeutic framing ("reconstitute," "map empathy onto action") that flatten embodied stakes. The crystal fragment warms and hums, but no cost or competing impulse complicates the final whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is richly embodied—"gripping reality loosely," the parasol-tip tuning ritual—and her contradiction (resenting miracles, terminally curious rather than suicidal) is legible. The change at closure (declining euthanasia, listening differently) arrives through accumulation rather than a single on-page micro-choice under duress; the shift reads as summary of offstage realization. Embodied interiority is strong ("humming to herself," clutching the parasol tip), but the final renunciation lacks a visible forfeiture dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through action and consistent philosophy, his motivation visible in concrete choices ("offering his hand—not to pull her up, but to walk beside her"). Mara's interiority is thinner, her arc from brittleness to softening occurs mostly through dialogue rather than embodied contradiction. The burned letter edge functions well as an anchoring object that reveals both characters' stances, but the therapeutic vocabulary ("intersubjective understanding," "co-create") intrudes into the character's natural thought at key moments. The final change feels more asserted through poetic summary than earned through on-page friction and forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The line walker's interiority is highly abstract—"whisperfield calm," "peripheral awareness," "psychic hollows"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her journey lacks internal conflict; she performs a ritual with serene competence, never struggling or foreclosing a path with visible cost. The prophet and other pilgrims are named but absent, leaving no on-page relationships to pressure her stance. Motivation is declared ("to preserve the echo of wisdom") but never tested by competing desires or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains at observational distance throughout, with no on-page choices that alter her situation or tactics. Interiority consists of label-only reflections ("she believed," "she knew") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The photographs receive more dramatic attention than the protagonist's agency. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost occurs; she simply repeats tomorrow what she did today.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scholar's motivation is clear and her commitment to listening over transcribing shows internal contradiction playing out in scene. However, the final choice—speaking instead of transcribing—feels more like a conceptual gesture than an earned character turn with visible cost; the weathered innocence remains static rather than tested. Embodied emotion is present in "thin and unused, trembling like a spider's thread" but much of the interiority leans toward abstract meditation. The piece lacks a second on-page character to test relational pressure, so status and crucible bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet's interiority is richly textured through his precognitively forgetful condition—remembered futures that dissolve, chalk-dust fingerprints as proof—and his grief is embodied in weeping without recognition. The piece lacks a second on-page character, so relationship pressure cannot apply. Internal contradiction is present (he seeks what he cannot retain) but the protagonist's agency remains observational; his micro-choices (arranging driftwood, dragging chalk) do not foreclose paths or alter tactics with visible cost, capping the score below the 7+ band where meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost would be required.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elira exists primarily as a vessel for metaphysical abstraction rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost-bearing choices. The piece offers label-only interiority ("luminous ache," "bittersweet throb") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that foreclose paths. The mentor's vanishing and childhood orchard are summary-only backstory that do not tilt present stance through on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara operates as a vehicle for lyric reflection rather than an agent under pressure. No on-page contradictory impulses or choice that forecloses a path; she ascends, sings, witnesses, and the "work" is done without friction. The vinyl shard's "golden filament" healing reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned cost. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("she understood then") instead of embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her "quietly deliberate" trait manifests consistently in her methodical recording and observation. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphysical musings rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The key moment of stepping through the threshold lacks visceral fear or cost—she simply observes and transcribes even as reality unravels. The final stance as "keeper of thresholds" is asserted rather than earned through a visible internal struggle or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist exhibits consistent traits—shrewdly innocent, forgiving—but her interior life often reads as poetic meditation rather than embodied conflict under pressure. The choice to leave the tooth and walk away carries symbolic weight but minimal visible cost; her calm certainty throughout flattens tension. The arc moves from understanding to teaching without dramatized resistance or contradiction within the character. Backstory ("learned from grandmother") anchors present action but no micro-choice tests her method against doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particularized through ritual actions and embodied memory, with the pearl-of-stillness metaphor grounding her stance. However, the piece is purely reflective; the star watcher makes no meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she executes a predetermined ritual and waits for villagers who never meaningfully appear on the page. The child's cameo arrives too late to test any internal conflict, and the protagonist's renunciation of fire has already occurred in backstory, leaving no present dilemma to earn.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's "watchful dreamer" stance is established but her choices are largely internal recalibrations rather than high-stakes decisions that alter external options. The interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion—"She was becoming"—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The viral confession backstory is referenced but never dramatized as a live wound that complicates her present sanctuary ritual. Her final decision to return with seeds is gentle but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The novelist's interior is present but largely static—she observes and collects without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final choice to write "the first true sentence" arrives as a label rather than an embodied struggle with visible cost. Emotions are frequently named ("lucidly watchful," "small and certain") rather than shown through bodily particulars or micro-choices under pressure. The cameo figures function as abstractions ("shapes of different hopes") rather than immediate pressures that force decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established through backstory and concrete detail (seventeen years of preparation, tracing murals, decoding lullabies), but her interiority remains largely explanatory rather than contradictory under pressure. The mission unfolds smoothly without genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The vine's response and the apparitions' appearance feel more like validation than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final moment reads as completion rather than renunciation or a decision that carries felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is declared ("to translate heartbeats into maps") but never tested by competing impulses or friction. Her patience and ritual actions are described extensively, yet no micro-choice reveals internal conflict or a hierarchy of values under pressure. The character remains a vessel for atmospheric demonstration rather than a person dramatizing contradictory wants. Embodied emotion is present in physical detail (breath, posture) but the interiority reads decorative, not pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "peripherally focused gaze" is asserted as a trait but never constrains an on-page decision with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("mercury," "poetry's coat") rather than embodied sensation, and no meaningful choice or renunciation forecloses a path—he simply completes his archive and leaves. The final walk away reads as completion without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fractal weaver's core motivation—to collect burdens—is established and embodied through the weaving action, but her internal contradiction remains ornamental rather than dramatized. The man's grief is shown through the clutched letter and trembling, though his choice to enter feels less pressured than inevitable. The weaver's final act of calcifying her own burden provides a meaningful choice, but the impulse arrives without prior internal friction. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("boundary-lessly trapped… not imprisoned") rather than contradictory wants acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is embodied through concrete action—thumb on grain, chisel moving—and her grief is "crystallized into something...hauntingly practical," shown via smoke detectors and jar-labeling. Internal contradiction appears when she won't rise for the kettle ("Let the water boil dry") yet moves deliberately with the carving, revealing competing values. The final choice to place the lion in light rather than keep it close feels earned by the prior rhythm work, though Viktor remains more archetype than individuated presence. Minor: "not yet shaped, not yet named" edges toward poetic scaffolding rather than strict character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("regret is my constant companion — not the sharp kind that cuts, but the dull, heavy kind"), but the final choice feels insufficiently earned by prior causality. The ghost remains abstract throughout most of the piece, limiting the friction needed to make "giving her the camera" feel like a meaningful foreclosure. The change at the end ("I do not regret") arrives more as assertion than dramatized shift, with the envelope's revelation doing conceptual work that character pressure should carry.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira demonstrates clear motivation through concrete actions (redirecting steam, installing kinetic tiles) and her work methodology is consistently embodied. However, interiority remains largely functional rather than contradictory—she moves through technical problems without evident internal conflict or cost to her person. The ending choice to "recalibrate" for the next quadrant lacks the foreclosed-path pressure required for higher bands; her arc is accretive rather than transformative, and no visible renunciation or endurance appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is richly embodied through sensory attention to gears and crystal, and his self-imposed silence holds contradictory impulses. The backstory block about abandoned symphonies exceeds 20% but tilts present stance via the tuning fork choice. The final act—humming—feels earned by the crystal's sensory cue, though the cost remains implicit rather than dramatized as a trade-off with visible friction. Motivation is coherent but the climactic choice lacks on-page resistance or consequence beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seeker's interiority is lyric and consistent, with a distinctive perceptual filter ("architecture of lies," salvage as restoration). The reflective mode dominates—mentor, past training, theory of lies—but anchors adequately in present stimuli (canal surface, locket, sundial angles). Motivation is clear and embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, watching rather than reaching, timing the retrieval). However, the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the seeker's calm is unbroken, and no genuine struggle or mistake compounds pressure before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seed collector's motivation is clear and her patient approach is embodied through concrete choices (offering the fulgurite, sitting in silence, asking permission). However, her interior life remains thin—we see determination but little internal contradiction or cost. The change from "collecting seeds" to "collecting hands" is stated rather than earned through on-page struggle. Havel is more vivid but functions primarily as a knowledge dispenser rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The traveler's motivation is consistently rendered through concrete acts—tracing the thread, writing, folding the crane—with embodied choices like "brushing moss from their knees" anchoring interiority. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between grief and orientation ("not to mourn death, but to map"), though the choice to write and leave the parchment reads more as ritual than high-stakes agency under pressure. Elira's portrait is vividly particular, yet she remains absent; the traveler's solitary frame limits relational crucible. The final renunciation of prayer and hope in favor of mapping qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible cost, but the protagonist's emotional arc flattens into a single sustained mode rather than evolving under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prince's embodied exhaustion ("trembling with exhaustion and hope," "hollow-eyed") and sustained commitment to a seemingly impossible task provide clear motivation. His interior life shows consistency—whispering theories to the egg, working by hypothesis—but the solitary design limits on-page contradiction or choice under interpersonal pressure. The final laugh-through-tears moment is embodied, though the journey from despair to hope lacks intermediate micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's profession and heritage create inherent contradiction, and the interiority around fire ("not to feed it, but to outrun it, outthink it, outlove it") is concrete and particular. However, the father figure remains more metaphor than person—his choices are told rather than dramatized, leaving the backstory reflective rather than causally embodied. The ending choice (returning to firefighting) feels inevitable but lacks a visible on-page cost that forecloses a path; she simply resumes her job without renunciation or alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The luminous skeptic is given a clear mission and method, but her interiority remains largely performative—scientific rationalism paired with mystical clarity—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The choice at Fountain Twelve (inserting the key, releasing memories) feels procedural rather than earned by visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats describe her actions and perceptions without dramatizing stakes that test commitment. The closing walk to Fountain Thirteen suggests iterative work rather than a transformed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentimentalist remains abstract throughout—neither embodied nor contradictory. Interiority consists of poetic declarations rather than concrete thought under pressure ("This is what we carried"). The gear-holding and singing motions are gestures without lived tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. No meaningful change occurs; the protagonist simply completes a pre-set task with no visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's carving work and ribbon-tying show embodied action, but his motives remain largely reflective rather than pressure-tested through on-page choice. The spectral mentorship is described as guiding his wrist, yet no moment dramatizes him resisting or choosing between Silas's phantom instruction and his own impulse. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("grief had geometry") without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under stress that would reach higher bands. The final choice to "begin the next" stone arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path—no alternative was legibly at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal state is embodied through physical detail (white knuckles, stiff knees) and his forty-three-year routine establishes credible motivation. The pivot from perfectionism to surrender is signaled by his wife's message, but the final choice—not winding, simply waiting—lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; he descends "heart lighter" without dramatized struggle or trade-off. The interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic abstraction ("incremental absolution...not a destination, but a direction") rather than staying rooted in immediate sensation. The change reads more as relief than earned transformation with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gardener's interior is present through embodied actions (humming, tracing threads, weeping) and her shift from soothing to stirring the dead tracks an arc. However, the transformation feels more asserted than earned—the realization about intentions as "messy, overlapping spirals" arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or struggle. The final change (from lullabies to questions) lacks visible cost; we see no foreclosed path or sacrifice that makes the shift painful or difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cartographer remains abstract throughout—no bodily reaction, no embodied contradiction under pressure, only declarative interiority ("she learned," "she knew"). The seventeen-winter backstory and predictive-modeling exposition occupy significant real estate without dramatizing a single micro-choice or revealing hierarchy of values. The final glyph sequence operates as ritual description rather than decision with visible cost; we never see her weigh competing goods or pay a price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The copyist's motivation is established early and her actions are consistent—transcribing, weeping, transmitting—but her internal experience remains largely decorative rather than conflicted. The tears-as-catalyst moment ("Her tears, she realized, were the final catalyst") reads as sudden realization rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is present (ink-stained fingers, heart thudding) but the character's struggle never fractures into genuine internal conflict; she moves smoothly from passive receiver to active broadcaster without visible cost or renunciation of a competing path. The final choice to transmit her own broadcast feels inevitable from her established traits rather than a decision that forecloses another live option.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through ritual action, but her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—she moves through practiced gestures without facing a meaningful choice that forces trade-offs. The visitor's recognition moment ("exactly how I felt") lands cleanly, yet the scatterer herself never risks anything; her final seat in the motionless chair reads as thematic tableau rather than earned stance crystallization. Interiority is consistently filtered through porcelain-mask imagery and art-ritual language, but the lack of on-page pressure that tests her method or belief keeps this in strong-but-safe territory. The piece delivers a character portrait without compelling her to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (cataloging artifacts, transcribing patterns, spitting at Council chants), but interior contradiction is limited—he operates from a single, unwavering ideological stance without genuine struggle between competing impulses. The chronometer cog functions as both heirloom and methodology, grounding his worldview in tangible objects. Micro-choices are present (climbing the bell tower, placing the cog, whispering coordinates) but lack visible cost or tradeoffs that would elevate characterization into high bands. The endurance reads as Earned Stasis, yet the renunciation of surface life occurred before the narrative window, weakening on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her trait of "expectant resignation" is embodied through waiting and teaching, but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—she waits, then acts. The moment a student appears, she pivots cleanly to teaching without visible cost or foreclosed option; the renunciation of bitterness is told in exposition rather than tested by on-page choice. Backstory dominates the middle third, and while it anchors in the rosette and library setting, it flattens present pressure rather than sharpening a micro-choice. The girl's arrival feels like a convenience reward rather than a choice Elara makes under competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's memory-tasting ability is established but never produces genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her choices proceed smoothly without meaningful struggle—she prunes, plants, waits, and the story delivers what she intends. The reflective passages label emotions ("grief into something softer") rather than embodying them through contradictory action. No visible cost forecloses a path; she succeeds without trade-offs, and the ending grants her everything she wants without price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's involuntary truthfulness constrains his interaction with the woman ("involuntarily truthful even when silence would've served him better"), and his decision to rise and guide her up the tower is purposeful. The woman's motivations are clear but her late introduction and quick pivot from urgency to reverence feel slightly telescoped. Interior contradictions are present (Elias's guessing vs. knowing, the woman's shift from report to belief) but could be sharper. The final exchange about belief over lightning collection earns closure through shared understanding with visible cost (secrecy maintained).

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly textured ("creeping normality she tracked," "sanctified thresholds") but her motivations remain abstract and external conflict is absent. The character observes and performs a ritual without facing embodied stakes or making a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("not to preserve, but to honor") but never dramatized through simultaneous impulses in scene. The walking figure remains more archetype than individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The statue's telepathic interiority is distinct and embodied through "cool as moonlit tide, warm as remembered hearth," and the historian's wonder versus theory-driven stance creates internal tension. However, the transformation at closure—"You are the thread now"—arrives through assertion rather than a choice with visible friction; the historian's shift from career-long certainty to carrier of nuance lacks on-page struggle or micro-decisions that would make the cost felt. The statue's dissolution reads as fulfillment rather than renunciation with stakes, softening the felt price. Emotional progression leans toward epiphany without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior world is vivid and consistent—his obsession with the missed gamble, the self-aware "grim optimist" stance, and the shift from carving to speaking proofs show contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, motivation remains largely reflective rather than dramatized through micro-choices under immediate pressure; the climactic moment (touching the reflection, losing the die) feels less like a decision with visible cost and more like a passive receipt of transformation. Embodied emotion is strong ("marrow-deep certainty," the metronome pulse of the die), but the final renunciation lacks the felt forfeiture that would anchor change to prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter's motivation is externalized through ritual and belief rather than tested by on-page contradiction. Her "methodically hopeful" stance is declared but never constrained by doubt or cost that would alter a later choice. The arrival of the teenage girl provides a micro-turn, but the painter's interior remains static—no hierarchy of values emerges under pressure. The barista's compulsion and the girl's dream are off-page effects, not dramatized friction that would force the protagonist to recalibrate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—rescuing dying arts through bread-baking custom—but her interior life remains at a comfortable distance. The piece shows her actions (climbing, documenting, baking) without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle that would complicate her mission. The boy's drum moment and others' participation feel like external validation rather than challenges that force Elara to weigh competing goods or face meaningful internal friction. The ending declaration "We are becoming it" reads as epiphany without the dramatized cost or renunciation that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.2)
    The clockmaker's motivation is articulated through abstract philosophical language ("fate's cruel arithmetic," "unraveling of fate's design") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His internal state remains declarative—"This was not redemption. This was rebellion"—without showing the bodily cost or genuine struggle that would make the final choice feel earned. The piece tells us he "gritted his teeth" and felt "bleak exhilaration," but these are labels rather than contradictory drives colliding under pressure. The ending gesture (climbing with gear in pocket, bitter smile) gestures toward complexity but arrives without the visible forfeiture or internal friction that would validate the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "unbosom" and "trick fear" remains abstract throughout; the climactic extraction of memories and confrontation with Fear-as-replica feels more conceptual gesture than earned character transformation. Interior experience is heavily decorated ("knot of dread coiled beneath my ribs like a sleeping serpent") but the actual choice mechanism—how extracting memories defeats fear—bypasses psychological causality in favor of symbolic convenience. The whispering advisor appears as guide but her advice never meaningfully conflicts with the protagonist's impulses, flattening potential internal contradiction. The final "you're the hunted thought" realization arrives as epiphany without prior embodied struggle that would make recognition costly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Prophet's motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is stated early and shapes his actions, but his interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. Kael's wide-eyed observation and single strike provide a micro-choice, but the Prophet's euphoria at the climax is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The apprentice's fumble and catch feel mechanical rather than earned by prior characterization. No visible cost forecloses a path; the triumph is complete without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartographer's motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (etching names in the whistle, seventeen seasons of refinement), but the peak choice—deciding to climb at midnight—feels inevitable rather than genuinely conflicted. Internal contradiction is gestured at through "quietly driven" and "hollow ache," yet the prose never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in a single moment. The renunciation of permission and city approval carries thematic weight but lacks visible friction or cost that would foreclose a live path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's motivation is clear and sustained, with embodied emotion ("pulse quickened") and a defined hierarchy of values (truth over convenience). However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction and exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to publish is told rather than dramatized with visible cost; we're assured of her resolve but never see her wrestle with a specific trade-off on the page. The attribute "emotionally rational" remains a label rather than a lived constraint that forces a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly articulated and her ritual of note-placing shows consistent devotion. The letter discovery prompts genuine emotion—"her stoicism yielding to the sensitivity she'd armored for years"—but the change reads more as momentary release than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Interior contradiction is present (stoicism vs. sensitivity) but acts sequentially rather than simultaneously in scene. The final refilling of the inkwell suggests continuity rather than transformation, keeping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The indexer's motivation is clear and consistent—tracing honest origins—and her tranquil perceptiveness is shown through observation (tilt of lectern, watermarks, decay patterns). However, she remains primarily a lens rather than an agent under pressure; her discoveries settle rather than shock, and no contradictory impulse complicates her resolve. The final stamp and notation feel ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; the piece privileges intellectual cataloging over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's motivation—grief folded into cranes—is clear and consistent, and his final choice (dropping the sapphire, releasing the lanterns) aligns with his arc. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("luminous torment," "hollow where a heart once beat") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under live pressure. The wife's dream and the shadow remain symbolic placeholders; we never see Silas wrestle with a specific, competing impulse that would make his transformation feel earned through dramatized internal conflict. The final smile arrives without visible cost or friction that would show what path he foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and sustained—she hunts pools of unused potential with calibrated desperation—but her interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("cartography of what-could-have-been") rather than embodied contradiction. The whispered names to the geode and the choice to queue thrusters show micro-decisions under pressure, yet the emotional progression feels more narrated than dramatically varied; grief is asserted repeatedly without fresh embodiment. The final choice to leap into translational drive carries visible cost (isolation, abandonment of control), lifting the score, but the piece would benefit from one on-page moment where competing impulses collide in action rather than reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pilot's internal state is established through concrete action (tracing glyphs, handling the chip) and her "perpetually surprised" trait appears twice but remains ornamental rather than driving contradiction. The closing shift from scanning to presence is legible but arrives through reflection rather than embodied struggle. The pilgrim functions as witness rather than applying pressure, and the protagonist's choice to stop searching feels declared more than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclosed other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her arc from forgery to truth-sifting shows progression, but the father's revelation arrives via convenient memory-object rather than earned confrontation with contradictory impulses in scene. The "tremor in her ribs" and subsequent vomiting embody her distress concretely, though the watch hand's mechanism feels more authorial than character-driven. The final pivot to becoming "the sieve" is thematically coherent but arrives as epiphany rather than through visible struggle between competing values. Interiority leans declarative ("she now knew") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The negotiator's interiority is concrete—her habit of touching the drawer pull, listening to pauses—but the protagonist remains largely passive through most of the piece. The key exchange of relics feels symbolically motivated rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The man's appearance and their conversation unfold without genuine on-page struggle; they arrive at mutual understanding too smoothly, without visible internal conflict that would earn the shift from courtroom enemies to shared walkers.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly developed through embodied metaphors (salt wind, collapsed expectations, regret magnetizing air), but the character arc suffers from passivity—she walks, names poles, remembers her father, then paddles away without dramatized internal conflict forcing a visible choice. The shift from paralysis to motion feels asserted rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The reflection-heavy design (~40% backstory/memory) anchors adequately in present stimuli (poles, compass, crow's washer) and includes micro-choices (pocketing the washer, climbing into the kayak), meeting BRR exception tests, but the final "becoming" reads as a label rather than a specific forfeiture or stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seeker's motivation is established (memory excision, seeking empathy), but interiority remains abstract through much of the journey—"hollow," "raw," labels without embodied contradiction. The lake sequence delivers concrete embodiment ("chest tightened—not with fear, but with recognition") and the baseball toss is a clean micro-choice that forecloses retrieval. However, the protagonist is largely reactive until that final gesture; Kael delivers the thematic insight rather than the seeker earning it through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The beast whisperer's motivation is consistently rendered—grief transformed into active conjuring—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("tectonic plates shifting beneath her soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The phoenix relationship is told through summary ("its laugh like wind through canyon flutes") instead of dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final "no longer just whisperer, no longer just beast" reads as a label for transformation rather than a lived shift with visible cost in her stance or capability.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation is clear—retrieving lost time with her daughter—and embodied through concrete ritual actions (unfastening, pressing palm, crawling through the saucer). However, interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("grief's quiet magnetism," "archive of evaporated seconds") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to descend feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle; we see renunciation of grip but no visible cost that forecloses a live option. The daughter remains off-page until the porch-swing voice, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's pacifist stance is declared but never tested by a choice where violence would solve a problem she must refuse. Her shadow-work interiority ("You are not my enemy. You are my anchor") reads as therapeutic label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The final reunion with her mother lands emotionally but the arc from solitary stitcher to embraced daughter lacks on-page micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. Interior voice remains consistent but the change feels granted rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"destitute philanthropist" is a label without contradictory impulses or embodied interiority. The bottle-opening sequence lacks micro-choices under pressure; she simply opens, releases, receives in a passive loop. Emotional progression is summarized ("She wept," "She laughed") rather than shown through bodily specificity or competing desires. The final "radiant" stance arrives without visible internal cost or a renunciation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentinel's motives are declared (spark a revolution via geometry) but never tested by a competing impulse or cost—she descends, aligns the sundial, copies angles, and exits without friction. Interior life remains at the level of confident assertion ("she smiled... someone who knew the world was listening") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beat ("knowing that somewhere below... would unfold their copy—and understand") tells us success rather than dramatizing a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative. No visible price paid or path refused on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The herder's motivation is clear and his precognitive curse functions as both constraint and tool, but the piece relies heavily on summary ("decades failing to grasp") rather than embodied struggle in the present scene. The grandmother's influence is told through memory rather than dramatized tension. The final choice—placing the last painted rock—feels more ritualistic than a decision that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; the herder moves through reverence without genuine struggle against his own impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interior life is rendered through heavily elevated diction ("rarefied her grief into ritual") that reads as imposed rather than lived. Internal contradiction is present ("furiously tranquil") but remains a label rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses in action. The final choice—not opening the envelope—lands as stance crystallization, but motivation remains abstract; we see her conclude "the scars were not endpoints but waypoints" without concrete micro-choices that earn the shift. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is declared through metaphor rather than physical sensation or contradictory micro-behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mechanical arm and needle-card handling provide embodied specificity, and the partnership arc shows progression. However, interiority remains thin—the philosopher's contradictory impulses are asserted ("diplomatically fierce") rather than dramatized in competing micro-choices under pressure. The woman's arrival and their synchronized work feel more like choreographed moves than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final choice to "perform it…everywhere" carries aspiration but lacks the grounded trade-off or renunciation that would anchor agency.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Molt's personality-molting trait is announced but never constrains an on-page choice; the "sardonic shell fully shed" moment reads as declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses in action. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("burrs in her coat lining," "old skin of cynicism peel away") rather than embodied sensation under pressure. The friendship with Elias supplies backstory weight, but his influence on her present actions remains abstract—no moment where competing impulses (cynicism vs. hope) force a visible tradeoff. The final gestures (planting seeds, singing) feel performative rather than desperate, missing the desperation that would sell the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her agency drives the climax, but interiority reads overwritten and abstractly poetic rather than embodied—"longing tempered to steel" and "surprise fate" are high-concept declarations, not lived contradictions in scene. The broken clock and film reel function more as symbolic props than objects that force micro-choices under pressure. Emotional progression is legible but the final moment ("didn't turn / Not yet") withholds agency rather than dramatizing a cost-laden choice, leaving the closure more gestural than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and sustained—protection of cultural memory through empirical verification drives all choices. Interiority shows concrete embodiment ("doubt, luminous and sharp, pricked him") and his mentor's voice returns with purpose. However, the piece leans heavily on contemplative exposition; micro-choices under pressure are sparse, and the climactic moment (seed splitting, system going live) happens *to* him rather than through a fraught decision that forecloses a path. The final act registers as observation more than agency-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elio's motivation is clear and he pursues it through concrete actions (tracing the lace pattern, following the compass), but his choices feel pre-determined rather than tested by genuine conflict. Interiority is heavily metaphorical ("silt settling," "dandelion seeds") without embodied contradiction or flawed impulses acting simultaneously. The final "recognition" moment with the trembling leaf reads as a label-only beat rather than earned cost. No secondary character applies pressure, leaving the protagonist unopposed throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her scientific background and desire to strip drama. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as sifting dust and setting up the interferometer. The final renunciation—abandoning neutron stars for dust—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her weeping and shift in publications. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are balanced with competence.

    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the ledger, studying frost) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from survival to purpose is earned through causality, with visible cost in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The undertaker's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with his "inadvertently stubborn nature" flaring into decisive action under pressure. His internal shift from weariness to purpose is earned through concrete micro-choices, such as tracing the lens crack and embedding prisms, culminating in a resonant endurance with visible cost (hands no longer tremble). Contradictory impulses of resignation and stubbornness act simultaneously in scene, driving the narrative forward without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in intergenerational support, with embodied micro-choices like tracing the bell and carrying baskets.

The cost of her anonymity is felt in the community's resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in a philosophical question, driving consistent micro-choices like aperture adjustment and breath-guided pursuit. Interiority is embodied through sensory details (e.g., trembling hands at pilgrim thought), and the final kneel is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are underdeveloped, limiting peak emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final realization is earned through prior causality, and micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values. The disintegration of photographs imposes visible cost, satisfying the quick test.

The final renunciation—leaving after forging the memory-catcher—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her battered state. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, dramatized through her actions of revealing destiny rather than stealing. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in moments like "heart pounding not with triumph but tenderness." However, the character lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses, keeping her slightly one-dimensional for a highest echelon piece, though her micro-choices under pressure are effective.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the glassblower's motivation to abandon old systems and craft safe zones is consistent and compels her actions, with earned renunciation in her departure carrying visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.5)
    Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("heart hammering," "knees cracking"), with motivation rooted in betrayal driving higher-stakes choices. The final transformation—burning the film to achieve liberation—is earned by prior causality, and contradictory impulses ("trembling certainty") act simultaneously in scene. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle's obsession with absence is consistently portrayed through embodied micro-choices, such as tracing pages and whispering summaries, culminating in an earned renunciation as she enters the mapped night. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with emotions filtered through tactile details like "calloused fingers" and "salt-stiffened shawl." The final choice feels inevitable due to prior causality, with visible cost in her descent into darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The robot's motivation is clear and intensifies through loops, with interiority shown via embodied actions like tuning the violin; the final realization that thoughts come from being witnessed is earned through accumulated micro-choices, with cost visible in the melting violin.

    Elira's motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her actions. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through micro-choices like placing the lens. The final change is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the keepers' responses.

Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his hope versus the curse's burden, driving credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; the poet's "furiously tranquil" state and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., not opening the envelope) reveal contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s worldview and motivation (“to strip needless drama from existence”) are vivid and consistent, and her actions—retreating to the greenhouse, abandoning gloves, shifting fields—track cleanly with that. Interiority is particular (neutron decay timelines, accretion disk models) rather than generic, and her humility at the spiral moment feels earned. However, her internal conflict is muted; we see little live contradiction or real struggle between competing impulses, which keeps the arc from feeling fully crucible-tested. The “breakdown vs recalibration” tension remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist is sharply etched through vocation, sensory focus, and her reframing of survival as “subtraction,” and her micro-choices (studying frost, decoding the ledger, building the kiln, gifting glass) align cleanly with her values. Interiority is particular and embodied, though she reads almost entirely lucid and self-possessed; contradictory impulses under pressure are muted, which flattens emotional volatility. The shift from almost-death and silence to purposeful making is credible and earns the final stasis. A hint more visible irrationality or active internal resistance in the middle stretch would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The survivor’s motivation—to disprove that silence equals absence and to translate it into music—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice on the page. Her embodied grief and resolve show through tactile focus (forks on sternum, palm to ice, palm to floor) rather than labels, which keeps her from feeling generic. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: she’s both mourning and refusing to treat herself as broken, which gives the mission emotional depth. The endurance at the end (choosing to continue this work in a quiet, ongoing way) feels earned, though the cost isn’t sharply dramatized beyond loneliness and effort.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The undertaker’s interiority is specific and embodied (“buried silence more often than bodies,” aching molars, trembling hands) and his core motive—to answer the signals and give the dead rest—is clear and consistent. His decision to act rather than ignore the lens grows credibly from his “inadvertently stubborn” nature and long history with the dead. However, internal contradiction is relatively light; he moves from reluctance to commitment with little on-page resistance or moral friction. The final inner shift to “chased stillness” feels earned but somewhat smooth, with limited visible cost beyond weariness and reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motives (intergenerational support, anonymity as covenant) are clear, specific, and consistently expressed in action—those nightly food runs under curfew feel lived. Her interiority is more steady than conflicted, but the quiet tension between being known (“We know it’s you”) and choosing to stay anonymous adds nuance. The final stance—refusing individual ownership of the bell, inviting succession—feels earned by everything before. A touch more visible doubt or frayed edges under pressure could deepen her complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The artist’s motive—spiritual curiosity about “where unused love is stored”—is clear and consistently expressed through her tools, breathwork, and reverence, and her reactions to Kwan Yin’s tear and the pilgrim feel particular rather than generic. Interiority is concrete enough (breath counts, ink-stained hands, inherited practice) to avoid abstraction. However, internal conflict is minimal: her curiosity is not meaningfully opposed by fear, doubt, or competing obligations, so her final shift reads as deepening rather than a hard-won reversal. The closing reconfiguration is earned but emotionally low-friction for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s desire “for texture” is vivid, specific, and drives every choice, from embedding the halo fragment to accepting the garden’s symbiosis. Her emotional life is embodied in concrete sensations (tasting future rain, the feel of dew as “liquid seconds”). The internal contradiction between curiosity and the cost to her memories is present, though not deeply contested once the full price is revealed. The final acceptance feels earned but could use one more moment of true resistance to reach top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The liberator’s motivation and traits—patience, strategic thinking, reverence for soil—are sharply embodied in concrete actions (solving the piano, seeding the vault, placing spores and the arrow). Her interiority feels particular rather than generic, and her competence is well-earned by details like the gardener’s journals. However, she faces little on-page internal contradiction; the piece favors a nearly saintly steadiness over visible ambivalence or moral friction. The final choice to risk herself and prioritize future finders (hiding the key) is fully motivated and thematically aligned but costs remain mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motive (to capture the sound of trust breaking, rooted in her sister’s loss) is clear and consistently drives her actions in the forge. Her interiority is specific—hearing colors, feeling time in her marrow—so she reads as an individual, not an archetype. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or micro-conflict: she rarely wavers or questions, so the emotional arc is more linear endurance than actively negotiated struggle. Her final renunciation of the greenhouse (“she knew she wouldn’t return”) is earned and carries legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thief’s vocation, worldview, and tenderness toward strangers are vivid and specific, and her actions (flower codes, moonbeam visions) clearly emerge from those traits. However, she faces little real resistance and exhibits almost no contradictory impulses or internal conflict; she is essentially an untroubled angel of fate. Emotional reactions are sketched more in concept than in body, with “heart pounding not with triumph but tenderness” doing a lot of summarizing work. The ending offers a mild deepening—a sense of cost via the half-empty jar—but not a sharp character turn or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glassblower’s motives—abandoning institutional power to create “safe zones for inquiry”—are clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her choices. Her craft knowledge and ritualized behavior feel lived-in, and her final willingness to move on, leaving the spheres behind, enacts a credible cost. What’s thinner is active internal contradiction under pressure; she’s largely resolved from the outset rather than being forced into a difficult, on-page reconsideration. The closing note of her own heart “melting” is earned but leans slightly toward summary rather than dramatized inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vivid, specific, and grounded in concrete history (mentor, accident, wire sabotage), and her motives for decrypting the notes and burning the film are crystal-clear and consistent with “firmly adaptive” survival. Contradictory impulses—phobic trembling vs. relentless investigation—coexist on the page rather than in neat stages. The choice to burn the footage reads earned by the prior emotional logic and costs her a piece of her past self. Some lines edge toward essayistic self-diagnosis (“Transformative betrayal doesn’t leave bruises; it leaves questions”) but they don’t undercut the core characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle’s obsession and method are sharply etched—“architecture of absence” and decades listening to hollows render a distinct psyche. Motivation is clear and embodied in her tactile engagement with the booklet and the hush. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or live internal struggle; she feels serenely aligned with her purpose even at the end. The final choice to enter the mapped night reads as an earned continuation rather than a pressured, conflicted break.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The janitor’s motivation is clear and consistent—its drive to understand thought shapes every beat, and the internal shift at the end is well earned by the accumulation of loops. The realization that its first thought arose from being seen grows plausibly out of earlier observations (the sigh, the trembling hands). However, there’s limited felt contradiction or struggle; its “remarkably composed” nature keeps emotional texture somewhat narrow, with little friction between impulses on the page. The change registers, but the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation is clear, specific, and nicely embodied in her actions with the lens and tickets, and her quiet endurance at the climax suits the world’s rules. However, her interiority stays relatively idealized and one-note—there’s little contradiction or visible fear that her attempt might fail—so the emotional arc lacks the extra complexity elite work tends to show. Secondary characters (Tannis, Vorr, the child) register more as symbolic responses than as pressures on Elira. The final smile and departure are earned but somewhat uncomplicated in terms of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vine dresser is specific, embodied, and motivated; her refusal of probability bands and devotion to cracked marbles form a coherent, lived-through stance. Her history with the wisteria and “mended deception” gives her interior a textured contradiction (tenderness masked as pragmatism). However, internal conflict in the present scene is muted—she’s serenely steadfast rather than visibly torn—so the final endurance costs her less on the page than it could. The intern applies some credible pressure, but their interaction doesn’t significantly reconfigure her options.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elira’s motive—proving time moves sideways—is clear, specific, and tied to her professional identity, and her calm, methodical temperament is consistently dramatized (bypassing safety “not recklessness, but necessity”). However, we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or fear beyond a brief tightening at the other Elira’s warning, so her emotional range under peak pressure feels somewhat limited. The “mechanically warm” persona is evocative but doesn’t significantly complicate her choices. The closing stance shift (from obsession to mapping “adjacent presents”) is credible but carries little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The musician’s motivation—to decode and complete the ghost’s submerged symphony—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. Her interiority is texturally vivid (listening with “skin” and “memory”), but we don’t see much active internal contradiction or competing impulses under pressure. The relationship with the ghost has emotional charge yet remains more archetypal than personal, which slightly limits depth. Her final stance (leaving with purpose rather than seeking more) feels earned but carries only a modestly dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with embodied details (stiff joints, shivering, the thumb-smudged orchid) that ground her abstract guilt. Her motivation—to live with or expel a swallowed truth—is legible and informs every micro-choice, especially pinning the illustration outside instead of discarding it. The simultaneous impulses toward silence and release create credible internal conflict. The final stance of endurance feels earned, though the off-page origin of the lie remains slightly vague, keeping this just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivations are rich and specific—“calibration” rather than belief is a sharp, character-particular driver. Interiority is well-embodied (static after sleep, tunnel echoes, tactile contact with the valve). Her contradiction as a skeptic drawn to psychic radio and hauntings feels psychologically credible. The closing shift from trying to offload guilt to accepting it as hers is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s motivation—to witness rather than preserve—is clear and consistent, and it meaningfully shapes the choice to enter and then to write afterward. Interiority is vivid but more archetypal than particular; the keeper feels like a role more than a fully individuated person. The best moment is the weeping “not for loss, but for beauty,” which embodies the nonjudgmental stance with a credible emotional contradiction. The final softening “like wax left too long in the sun” lands as an earned but low-intensity change rather than a deeply costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and mission are sharply etched, and her key actions (refusing to perform, choosing to sing wordlessly, surrendering the curl) align with those motives. However, she is more vessel of wisdom than conflicted person; we rarely see clashing impulses or genuine blind spots. Secondary figures (the girl, family, villagers) are evocative but lightly sketched, applying gentle rather than acute pressure. The final transfer of the curl implies cost but doesn’t quite dramatize her internal struggle around that loss.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The historian’s motive—preserving stories against entropy—is clear, consistent, and particular, and her perceptions (walls humming, pages “trembling with suppressed truth”) feel rooted in a specific sensibility rather than a generic archivist. However, internal conflict is muted: there’s little sense of fear, doubt, or competing impulses as she uncovers material of enormous implication. Her final choice to descend to the underlibrary reads as an extension of existing purpose rather than a pressured, costly shift. Strong, distinctive, but not yet at the level of complex, contradictory interiority expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and operational logic (directing flow, compressing meaning) are vivid and consistent, and his specific habits (tide charts, typewriter, fortune phrasings) individualize him. However, he functions more as an idea-engine than a fully embodied person; there’s little concrete interior conflict or contradictory impulse on the page. Emotional states are mostly implied through role and metaphor rather than dramatized reactions under pressure. The retired analyst is sketched effectively but remains a foil, not a crucible that forces Elias into a costed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The priest’s motivation (to resist/redirect possession through rhetoric and illumination) is clear and consistent, and his final choice to embody a better question feels causally earned. However, his emotional life is largely abstracted into concepts (silence, assumption, syntax) with minimal embodied contradiction or visceral fear, which flattens interior conflict. The realization that the possession is “answering” not invading is strong but lands more as an intellectual pivot than a felt rupture. Adding even a small, concrete tension between his faith, fear, and rhetorical obsession would deepen the cost of his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation and interiority are vivid and particular—“chronologically homesick” and driven to conduct “unheard symphonies” is a strong, specific engine. Her micro-choices (maintaining the ritual, then knowingly pushing past the “before exhaustion hits” rule) feel motivated and character-true. Internal contradiction exists but is relatively mild; we see desire versus self-preservation, but the cost of pushing herself is more stated than felt. The piece stops short of a sharper reckoning with what this practice is doing to her, which would lift the character into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to “conquer the labyrinth of self” via the tablet—is clear and consistently expressed through concrete micro-choices (stepping into the room, touching each wall, speaking confessions). Interiority is specific and embodied through the environment rather than stock labels, though lines like “I ran because I thought I was unworthy” brush up against therapy-speak. Her arc from defiance of gravity to integrating multiple selves is legible and earned by prior beats. The primary limitation is that internal contradictions are resolved relatively quickly once she starts confessing, with less resistance than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority—deafness, tactile relationship to sound, fear of returning numbness—is specific and embodied, and her choice to risk “rupture” with the backward record feels motivated and consistent. Her contradictory impulses (sanctuary of hush vs. provoking raw presence) are dramatized rather than explained. Students are sketched but functional as a collective mirror rather than individuals. The final reorientation toward the void (“not as absence, but as potential”) is earned by the prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn as meticulous, solitary, and ethically driven, with his habits (field journal, cache, instruments) revealing character through action. His internal conflict between solitude as integrity and the need to act now that institutions are compromised is clear and specific. The closing shift—“Solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it”—feels earned by prior choices rather than epiphanic handwave. Some emotional beats remain relatively cool and cerebral, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lantern broker’s grief, professional caution, and long-delayed choice to open the vial create a coherent, textured interiority. Her micro-choices (coming “not for profit,” uncorking despite fear, then using the UV lamp) feel motivated and reveal values. The internal conflict—caution vs. desire to finally face encoded grief—is present but remains relatively smooth, with little genuine self-contradiction on the page. The final shift toward embracing other vials reads earned, though the emotional turn borders on tidy insight rather than fully conflicted struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s motivation (to understand the “texture of time”) is clear and consistently expressed through her tactile relationship with the rope and her response to Silas’s story and the village dilemma. Her ethically playful stance comes through in how she withholds judgment and refuses to offer answers. Internal contradiction is present but soft—she’s searching and unsettled, but rarely under acute personal pressure, so her final lightening feels more observed than hard-won. Secondary figures (Silas, elders) are mostly thematic foils rather than fully pressuring relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is beautifully articulated and consistent—playing “to unbind” and to find “beauty in the unfinished” feels organic to her world and choices. However, interior conflict is underplayed; she rarely experiences contradictory impulses or genuine doubt, which slightly flattens potential depth. Her emotional life is implied through action and setting more than dramatized in specific, embodied reactions. The child functions as a responsive presence rather than a true relational crucible, so character pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vael’s motivation and arc are sharply articulated: a transactional dealer seeking “fusion” and ending as a conduit who renounces her market role. Her interiority is concrete and particular (static as emotional sensor, half-truths as survival tool), and her final renunciation (smashing vials, changing her practice) clearly costs her status and livelihood. The contradiction between her professional detachment and her choice to subsume another’s fractured legacy feels earned by the petal sequence. There are faint hints of thematic neatness around her new vocation, but they don’t undercut the credibility of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically tied to his professional sensibility, and his actions consistently arise from that drive. However, he experiences almost no genuine internal conflict—once the “tug” appears, he follows it without real hesitation or moral friction. The shrewdness and cargo-broker aspect are lightly sketched and never seriously complicate his altruism. This keeps him likable but somewhat idealized and limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s longing for community is clear, specific, and enacted through concrete micro-choices (leaving sculptures as “pleas,” encoding clues, trusting the note). Her embodied emotions track well with setting, but internal contradiction (yearning vs. fear of rejection) is more implied than dramatized, so the final step into the loom has little visible resistance. Vesper and the supporting figures are evocative but largely archetypal and exert minimal direct pressure on her choices. The final transformation into “the grafting point” is thematically apt but arrives a touch smoothly, with limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is vivid and specific (to find where echoes are born, midwife vanished creatures) and her professional lens colors perception, but internal conflict is light—she rarely hesitates or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure. The cost (fatigue, overborrowing, risk of waking the giant) is present but not deeply felt as a personal moral or emotional dilemma. Her competence dominates, which slightly flattens potential complexity in peak beats. Still, her choices track cleanly and culminate in a credible, earned stance at the end when she pockets the pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motivation—to comprehend an ambiguous loss through a fusion of magic and mathematics—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed in action (glass eyes, integrals, the orchard). The interiority is textured and character-particular, with strong embodied links between memory, space, and thought. The arc from seeking “coordinates for silence” to recognizing the loss of shared language feels earned. The only limiter is a relative lack of on-page contradictory impulses under pressure; she moves with calm coherence rather than visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dweller’s motivation and inner life are specific, coherent, and embodied; her reverent handling of objects and the warmth “spreading through her ribs, like light through stained glass” make her feel particular rather than archetypal. The internal shift from hoarding-as-reverence to sharing-as-connection is clearly motivated by the tape and the staff’s response, and the final earned stasis (“She didn’t need to emerge. Not yet.”) lands. Some thematic sentences (“Visibility wasn’t spectacle. / It was resonance.”) move toward essayistic abstraction rather than dramatized contradiction, slightly flattening complexity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nursery owner’s interiority is specific and consistent: a mix of reverence, control, and quiet desperation that earns her eventual surrender. Her conflict between scientific dissection and kinship with plants is dramatized through concrete micro-choices, especially when she lowers the clippers and later tears out her notes. The turn from observer/owner to participant feels motivated by accumulated behavior and guilt, not a sudden epiphany. A slight softness is that her external stakes (rent, colleagues) are gestured at but never materially pressure the central choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The painter’s inner life is specific, coherent, and textured: insomnia, wry skepticism, compulsion to “thresh meaning” all play directly into her choices. Her exhaustion and self-doubt are embodied (brush trembling, raw eyes) rather than labeled, and her final trade costs her something she clearly values. Internal contradiction—rationalizing against “magic” while apologizing to the brooch—adds believable tension. If anything, the arc is slightly tidy for such a damaged person; the sleep that follows the exchange comes a bit easily.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clairvoyant is specific, embodied, and conflicted: her twitching hands, forgotten wish, and ambivalence about using the pearl all reveal a textured interior. Her motivation to magnify “everyday magic” versus her fear of the unseen gives her a credible arc toward integration. The pilgrim is more archetypal and underdeveloped, functioning mainly as catalyst rather than a fully pressured character. The final understanding feels earned but carries a relatively soft, mostly conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s vocation, temperament, and guiding motivation are clear and specific, and her actions (listening, mapping, proposing the rite) consistently flow from them. The “reactively visionary” angle is nicely dramatized in how she works with gaps rather than declarations. What’s missing for a higher score is a live, on-page internal conflict or real ambivalence; she moves through the piece with near-angelic steadiness. The final endurance/renunciation—no memorials, only names—is resonant but costs her nothing personally beyond a generalized grief.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motivation and vocation are sharply defined—her mapping obsession, her mother’s legacy, and the desire for the “fortress of unspoken truths” all cohere into a specific, persuasive drive. Her interiority is particular (mapping shame like tunnels, treating each fear as a coordinate), though genuine internal conflict is muted; she hesitates “not from fear, but reverence,” which softens the sense of struggle. The final transformation (from mapper to listener/threshold-keeper) feels earned by prior traits rather than arbitrary. The piece could reach a higher band with one or two more moments where her desire to know collides painfully with the risk of personal unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira is sharply drawn as a “sympathetic skeptic” whose motive—to sculpt space for reflection—consistently guides her choices, especially in how she treats the tile as a conduit rather than a tool for power. Her interiority is specific (“skepticism warred with sensation”) and embodied through actions like placing the parchment “not for scholars, but for wanderers.” However, her arc involves a fairly gentle repricing rather than a pressured change with visible cost, so the emotional stakes of her shift remain modest. The piece could reach a higher tier with one sharper moment where her doubt or fatigue meaningfully tempts her away from listening.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The immortal’s core motivation—ennui pushing him to seek “what happens after goodbye”—is clear, consistent, and pays off when he steps through the gateway without flinching. However, his emotional range is narrow: boredom, curiosity, then reverence, with little genuine internal contradiction or resistance under pressure. The warlock anecdote nicely hints at his moral ambiguity, but that thread never returns to complicate the climactic choice. The final stance feels earned but relatively untested, which trims some depth from his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The child’s motivation (“mathematics of a fair trade,” refusal of profit) is specific and consistent, and their micro-choices—stealing the pot, choosing the funeral home, offering the ink freely—align with that ethic. However, internal contradiction (raised by a con but pursuing fairness) is asserted more than dramatized in live, conflicted beats; the child remains almost serenely self-possessed throughout. Secondary characters (mortician, widow, politician) feel symbolic rather than individuated and exert limited personal pressure. The future-facing stance toward the father is emotionally promising but under-tested on the page, softening the cost of the final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stationer’s motivation—to collect “textures of different times”—is clear, consistent, and embodied in her rituals and note-taking, and her emotional response to discovering someone else’s invented era feels particular and earned. Her shift from solitary, quasi-possessive archivist to someone who leaves the notepad open for others is a credible, motivated change. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper on-page internal contradiction or costed ambivalence in the moment of opening her practice to others; the choice is moving but almost too smoothly aligned with her existing values.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply defined by vocation and condition—“bureaucratically dead” and compulsively collecting erased textures—so his motivation reads specific and consistent. Interiority is mostly conceptual and sensory rather than emotionally conflicted, which keeps him a bit abstract. His final stance (“He would keep collecting”) is an Earned Stasis that fits his traits but doesn’t reveal much new contradiction or cost. The lack of on-page relationship pressure keeps characterization powerful but somewhat single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The myth buster’s grief, obsessive myth-debunking, and ritual with the shell/cello create a specific, credible interior life, and her final renunciation (choosing to stop seeking answers in ghosts) grows organically out of those patterns. Motivation is clear and consistent across years of backstory and the single night on the page. The main limitation is that contradictory impulses at the peak (urge to keep decoding vs. urge to stop) are more implied than actively dramatized; the shift to acceptance feels swift and relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific—her “dual allegiance” between anarchic carnival and planners’ blueprints is dramatized in her tactics rather than told once and forgotten. Her agency is strong and consistent: she chooses indirection and reorganization over confrontation, and that choice scales all the way to the tilt‑a‑whirl mural. What’s missing at a top-tier level is deeper, embodied interiority under pressure (we don’t feel panic, shame, or doubt in her body; we’re told her allegiance “aches” but rarely inhabit that ache). The final refusal to show up at City Hall feels earned but emotionally under-textured given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inspector’s motivation is clear and particular—“purposefully curious,” drawn by elegy rather than duty—and her choice to come at all is already a character beat. Her interiority is specific (schematics, molecular pathways, archival tagging), not generic, and the shift from “documentation” to “vigil” reads as an earned reorientation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (scientific observer vs mourner); under this quiet pressure it’s enough, though it never quite sharpens into a painful dilemma. The final act of labeling and walking away without looking back feels like credible, low-key Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is vivid, competent, and particular—her tactile listening and rituals feel specific and embodied—but she reads as almost wholly serene and self-actualized, with little visible internal contradiction. The motivation to "decode feedback into direction" is strong and thematically aligned, yet she never seems genuinely tested by doubt, fatigue, or frustration. Her choices (taking the job, working unhurriedly, blessing the drone, immediately turning to the music box) are coherent but not deeply conflicted. The lack of flaw-pressured decision-making keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atlas editor is sharply etched: dry, meticulous, skeptical yet quietly obsessive, with motives and worldview embedded in every line (“editing out empires to reveal aquifers”). His desire to locate river origins is consistent and particular, not generic wonder-seeking, and his micro-choices (trusting the condensation method, walking out onto the frozen lake, deciding to “witness” instead of “plant a flag”) all flow from that. Internal conflict—bureaucratic irony versus reverent attention—is subtle but present and resolved into a credible Earned Stasis of quiet acceptance. The only limit at this length is that we don’t see a sharper on-page cost to his choice beyond solitude and relinquishing glory, which keeps this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bell tuner is specific and compelling—"infinitely patient," tactile in her work, and defined through craft rather than exposition—but she remains more archetype than person, with little on-page contradiction or emotional risk. Motivation (restore balance) is clear and consistent, and her final renunciation (leaving the fork, walking away) tracks logically. However, we never feel a genuine struggle between competing impulses; endurance is asserted rather than tested. This keeps the piece from achieving deeper psychological penetration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s motivation—choosing revelation and acceptance over rescue—is clear and consistently dramatized, especially in her decision to remain still while her oxygen runs out. The internal conflict between survival instinct and the need for stillness is sharply rendered in the moment where “Instinct shrieked: seal it, flee, survive. But she forced her hand to stay open…”. Emotional embodiment is generally specific (heat of the vial, muffled heartbeat), though a few statements verge on thematic summary rather than character-particular thought (“now a pilgrim of silence”). The final endurance/death reads as earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The boy’s motivation—escaping his father’s legacy by inscribing a new kind of truth—is clear and drives every major choice. We feel his embodied fear and resolve (“breath shallow,” “trembling fingers”), but his inner conflict is more implied than dramatized; he rarely wavers or contradicts himself in scene. The moral and emotional cost (being branded mad, surrendering ownership of the story) lands, yet his relationship to the buried bodies remains abstract, blurring some stakes. Overall, he reads specific and non-generic, but not yet at the depth or contradiction expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ghost bride’s motivation—vengeance curdled from devotion and a debt to repay—is vivid and coherent, and Elara’s brief on-page reaction (“not from fear, but from the sudden, searing clarity”) lands credibly. However, internal contradiction is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in scene; we’re told about the twisted love, but we rarely sit inside a live moment of her conflict. Elara, as heir and receiver of the burden, is emotionally sketched rather than deeply individuated. The final transformation into “heritage” feels earned conceptually but not fully tested through character-level struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The weaver’s motivation—transforming ruin into reverence—is concrete, inherited, and consistently dramatized through her ritual choices, especially in choosing to mend the plate instead of destroying or hiding it. Interiority is conveyed via tactile, specific perceptions (“dust that tasted of forgotten hymns,” needle-scars as vows) rather than abstract labels. However, she faces little on-page internal contradiction or serious temptation to do otherwise, so her arc reads as deepening a fixed stance rather than testing it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to reorient a broken communal faith through slow, reverent excavation—reads clear and consistent, and her “purposeful wandering” plus refusal to demand miracles nicely particularize her. The internal tension between exile’s doubt and inherited myth is present but mostly implied; she rarely feels genuinely torn on the page. Her final endurance choice (“She never left”) is thematically apt and believable, though the cost of that renunciation could be more concretely felt in her body or fears. Overall, she reads as specific and coherent, if a touch idealized and under-conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s vocation, backstory (misrouted final letter, grandmother’s postal reverence), and current commission (widow’s message) make her feel specific and motivated. Her emotional palette—quiet ache, ritualized care, distrust of digital—is well rendered in concrete habits (early mornings, clipboard, watching children). However, internal conflict is implied more than dramatized; we don’t see a live dilemma where contradictory impulses are in true tension. The ending is more a restatement of her stance than a new, costly choice, which keeps the character arc from fully landing.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The embroiderer’s motives (listening for unheard stories, protecting the realm) are clear and consistently expressed through her work with the flame and tapestries. However, she reads as serenely hyper-competent; we rarely see contradictory impulses or degraded thought under stress, which blunts psychological depth. Her choice to act through “foolishness” is strong but largely conceptual rather than dramatized as an ongoing inner conflict. The final endurance—working through the night until she collapses—is credible but carries limited felt cost beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The medium’s motivations are clear and specific—she wants to “evoke…the moment before deciding” and is burdened by unsent apologies—and her actions (entering the labyrinth, using the shard, relinquishing the letters, stepping onto the new path) all arise from that inner drive. Interiority is vivid and particular (“wax that cracked like frozen regret”), and the moon-healing/memory-cost adds a concrete, character-specific flaw. Internal conflict between clinging to regret (keeping the letters) and risking change (letting them dissolve) is present, though it stays more lyrical than sharply dramatized. The final stance shift—choosing a new path without looking back—feels earned and paid for, but the cost to her memory is gestured at more than fully felt in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her history as a translator who fears failing as a witness; that fear clearly motivates her decision to engage with the cast instead of dissociating under the anesthetic. The emotional conflict between numbness and attentive witnessing is present and credible, if more atmospheric than sharply dramatized as a dilemma. Her final reframe from “grief” to “kinship” feels earned by the prior work of decrypting and speaking the child’s words. The only drawback is a slight tendency to state motivation and realization in essay-like lines rather than letting them emerge entirely from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s artistic worldview, methods, and buried disillusionment are clearly and specifically rendered, and her turn from “significance” to unguarded joy feels earned by the accumulated details of her practice. The fragment cracking open “a memory not of place, but of feeling” is an excellent hinge that reveals her internal lack without naming it diagnostically. Her embodied reaction at the climax—laughing fully for the first time in years—pays off the setup. The one soft spot is that her prior career pressures and compromises are summarized rather than dramatized in a concrete earlier moment.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s vocation, curiosity, and “methodically playful” temperament are vividly rendered and consistently expressed through her problem-solving. Her motivation to experience the Nested Awakenings rather than merely preserve the mural is clear and credibly deepens by the end. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are relatively soft—her shift from restorer to willing subject is compelling but comes with little resistance or messy ambivalence on the page. As a result, the final change, while earned, feels relatively low-pressure compared to elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rogue scholar’s motivation (protecting banned language and her “spark of defiance”) is clear, consistent, and rooted in a specific backstory (her father fined for Basque). Her tactics—seed in the mouth, coded gardening, refusal to express gratitude—embody that motive in concrete choices. Dr. Vex’s small but meaningful turn from suspicion to complicity adds a real relational shift. What’s missing for higher marks is sharper on-page contradiction or inner conflict; she never seriously wavers, so the arc feels more steady than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation—“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”—is specific, coherent, and drives every image and action. Her contradiction (“shyly unstoppable”) is dramatized through her avoidance of visitors vs. her compulsion to sing to the wind. Emotional experience is largely conveyed through embodied metaphors (bones carved hollow, heartbeat against the postcard) rather than labels. The only limiter is that we never see her truly waver or make a fraught on-page choice; her endurance is moving but a bit too stable to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker’s vocation, belief in the crack as “an opening,” and quiet fidelity to the rules give her a clear, specific psychology. Her motivation is strong and coherent, and her micro-choices (listening instead of forcing, tending absence rather than resurrecting) align with that. Internal contradiction is only lightly implied via the cautionary examples of other caretakers instead of dramatized in her own temptation, so the cost of her restraint never fully spikes on the page. The ending lands as earned stasis rather than a deepened inner turn, which is fitting but keeps the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The linguist’s motivation (“to restore trust after silence”) is specific, consistent, and embedded in her methods and risks, not just stated. Her “carefully reckless” nature appears in concrete behaviors (fist-pumps followed by triple-checking). Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized, and we don’t see a sharp contradictory impulse under peak pressure, which keeps this just below top-tier. The curator relationship adds a light but effective status and ethical pressure without fully becoming a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—the machinist’s drive to reconcile flood control with mercy is dramatized through concrete micro-choices like aligning the chain and copying glyphs onto her arm. Her contradiction (dutiful technician vs covert rebel) feels earned and culminates credibly in “This was her rebellion: not sabotage, but synchronization.” The main limitation is that her past complicity and its emotional cost are mostly summarized rather than put under sharper, on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives—preserving lost songs while compulsively revising her own history—are rich, specific, and deeply embedded in her routines with the birds and ledgers. The reversal from reinvention to honest self-recording is cleanly earned through the meteorite/dust-mapping discoveries. Emotional embodiment is strong (calloused fingers, weeping over the log), though a touch more friction or resistance at the moment she chooses honesty could deepen the sense of cost. Still, her internal contradiction is rendered with unusual clarity for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand thresholds, her father’s disappearance, and the cost of “necessary distances”—is clear, specific, and drives every beat. Her interiority is textured and idiosyncratic (wood grain as chronology, weather-as-emotion). The final choice to step off the terrace is well-earned by prior grief, study, and revelation. Internal contradiction (longing for closeness vs honoring distance) is present but mostly articulated rather than dramatized in active conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her desire “to learn the rhythm of belonging” is clear and consistent, and we see it embodied in tactile actions (mapping emotional ley lines, handling the feather, responding to the fireflies). Interiority is concrete and specific, but internal contradiction is fairly mild—she’s lonely then not, without a real clash of impulses or costly mistake. The final shift from exile to felt belonging is earned but gentle, more epiphany than pressured choice. I missed a sharper flaw or blind spot that would make her transformation feel more hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recollectionist’s motives are clear and particular—curiosity, inherited duty, joy in melancholy—and her micro-choices (pressing seeds to her skin, using the crater glass, deciding to plant seeds for children) flow consistently from those traits. The “cheerful gloom” register makes her emotional life feel embodied rather than generic. The internal turn from “solve the mystery” to “carry it” is credible but the cost is mostly conceptual, not strongly dramatized. I’d look for a sharper contradiction or sacrifice on the page to push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s characterization is vivid and specific—“analytical street performer” with a quasi-mystical rigor—and his worldview is consistently dramatized through how he treats chance as a collaborator. However, his internal life is largely asserted rather than pressured; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a real test of his creed. The micro-arcs of barista/teen/physicist reveal him well by reflection, but his own cost or risk remains muted. The final endurance—remaining with the bishop—is thematically apt but not meaningfully conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tide dancer’s inner life and motives—rebellion through exile, resistance via art, devotion to memory—are vivid and consistent, and her final decision to teach feels earned. Embodied emotion is strong in the central dance sequence (“sweat traced silver rivers down her ribs,” feet bleeding into moss). Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle: she both flees and rewrites the world, but this tension could be sharpened with more overt doubt or fear in the middle stretch. Villagers and the child function symbolically more than as individuated pressures, but that’s appropriate to this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glazier’s motivation and worldview are vivid, specific, and consistent, especially in how he interprets light, damage, and routine work. His father’s shipwright lesson deepens him beyond a one-note eccentric. However, there’s little on-page internal conflict or visible cost; he’s largely serenely aligned with his own philosophy. The piece earns endurance rather than change but doesn’t quite stage a crucible moment that tests him.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The firefighter’s motivation—to carry rather than bury pain, especially for children—is specific, consistent, and embodied in concrete actions (walking the ridge, reading, leaving his own letter). His history (wife, squadmate, oak grove) deepens stakes without turning into generic backstory. The endurance at the end is an earned stasis: he chooses to keep remembering, with visible cost. A slight softness is that internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we rarely see him actively tempted to do otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dreamer’s motivation—revitalizing “equations that governed possibility”—is clear and consistently expressed, and her choices (pattern designs, questions sent with balloons) track well with that aim. Interiority is present but fairly abstract; she reads more as an archetypal functionary of hope than as a fully individuated person with contradictions. The line “None of it broke her. Instead, it refined her.” hints at conflict but the piece never really dramatizes a moment where she might crack or waver. The ending endurance feels earned conceptually, but the cost to her personally is underdeveloped at this literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cartographer’s motivation (to hear what walls dream and perhaps let stone forgive) is specific and consistently expressed through her choices to listen, read, and finally leave her own record. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hollow behind her ribs,” satchel lighter/heart heavier) without lapsing into diagnostic labels. Internal contradiction—her simultaneous attraction to and weight from legacy—is present but could be sharpened under more direct pressure. The final renunciation/acceptance (leaving the sketch and diaries, keeping the burden but sharing it) feels earned and carries a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The painter’s motivation—to return the borrowed heartbeat and coax the mirrors into possibility—reads clear and consistent, and her ritualized choices structure the scene. Interiority is more archetypal than psychologically specific, which fits the mythic mode but limits emotional contradiction or visible struggle. The child and the father/child scenes in the mirrors hint at deeper relational stakes without fully dramatizing them. Her final refusal to linger is thematically apt but feels like a role-obligation rather than a hard personal choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira is sharply etched as a weary, persistent negotiator whose history with failed treaties clearly motivates her return to the terrace. Her emotional state is embodied in details like the dusty boots and the way she clutches the clipboard, and her choice to proceed despite exhaustion feels earned. Internal contradiction—frayed conviction versus stubborn resolve—is present but mostly told rather than dramatized in active hesitation or missteps. The survivors are sketched more as a collective than as individual foils, so relational pressure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—an amoral destroyer privately obsessed with preserving echoes of what he’s erased—is clear, specific, and drives every action in the scene. His internal contradiction (bankrupting water authorities vs. kneeling on the salt to offer the egg) feels earned rather than posed. The “clean” feeling at the end is credible as a transient reconfiguration, not a tidy redemption. The only small limit is that his inner resistance or doubt under pressure could be dramatized one notch more intensely.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtesan’s motivation is vivid and particular—chastity as poetic discipline and defiance of conformity—and her actions (enduring the cold, patiently untangling threads) align with that ethos. Internal contradiction is lighter; she reads as serenely resolved rather than torn, which slightly flattens peak pressure. Still, the final “homecoming” smile feels earned as a resonant reconfiguration of her solitude rather than a sudden epiphany. I’d like one sharper moment of doubt or temptation to deepen the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The calligrapher’s motives and shame are well articulated, and the link between his old commissions and his new practice feels specific and earned. His flaw—using beauty to mask harm—is dramatized via Mira’s accusation and the veteran’s reaction, not just told. The main limitation is that almost all conflict is retrospective or anticipated; we rarely see him in live emotional contradiction in the present dome scene. Still, the final stance (“I reverse not to undo, but to reveal”) is credible given the prior beats and carries a visible relational/moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority and motivation are clear and particular—her devotional drive, the “transiently rooted” paradox, and her covenant to “dignify the vanishing” feel specific and embodied in action. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction under pressure; she never wavers or makes a costly trade-off beyond the baseline cost of solitude and impermanence. Her endurance/renunciation at the end (refusing to touch the monarch, leaving the shrine unfound) is earned but not sharply tested. The result is a finely etched but slightly static psychological portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s vocation, guilt, and tenderness cohere into a distinct, credible psyche; “technically gentle” hands paired with casting hollow gods vs. this new work gives her an earned internal contradiction. Motivation—to preserve forgotten names as living resonance—is crystal clear and governs every choice in the sanctum. What keeps this just shy of top-tier is that internal conflict remains mostly resolved before page-one (the self-forgiveness is given, not struggled through here), so we see deepened commitment rather than a pressured change of heart. The final renunciation of signature is moving but not a hard, newly-costly choice so much as a natural extension of the stance already stated.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—her history with foresight/hindsight, her mother, and her obsession with paths all cohere and drive her descent. Interiority is vivid and embodied, and her final shift toward the “living now” is earned by what precedes it. However, internal conflict is relatively smooth; contradictory impulses don’t significantly clash in-scene, which softens the sense of cost. Her competence and insight come easily, with little visible struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    The astronomer’s core traits—frugality, obsessive precision, and quasi-religious rationalism—are sharply rendered and consistent with his choices (selling his cloak, logging the resonance as “page 3,412”). However, internal conflict is minimal; his drive is unwavering, so we rarely see contradictory impulses in real time. The ending reads as an Earned Stasis (he continues his path at cost), but because no live alternative is genuinely in play, the emotional charge is somewhat muted. The characterization is strong and particular, but the lack of on-page dilemma keeps it below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s pacifism, cunning, and stored fury are vividly embodied (“each tension a relic. Each ache an archive”), and her choice to seek release rather than retaliation is coherent throughout. Internal contradiction—schemer yet pacifist, angry yet refusing violence—is clear and dramatized. The shift from dependence on the music box to internalizing its function feels earned and forecloses her prior reliance on tools over self. Some explicit, almost essayistic self-analysis slightly blunts the sense of messy, unresolved human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mirror maker’s motives are clear and consistent—grounded reverence for costly magic, and the desire to capture the runaway dream. Her professional identity and past as a once-similar child enrich her, and her choices (trading mirrors, choosing breath over chant, accepting this as her final craft) track logically. However, internal contradiction and live emotional struggle are muted; she rarely feels truly torn or under strain. The ending’s “no dream would dare flee from her again” hints at cost but doesn’t force a sharply felt on-page renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mender’s motivation to reconnect with her daughter is clear, consistent, and colored by a believable blend of stubbornness and tenderness. Her craft instincts, rule-breaking, and quiet refusal of “redemption” in favor of “repair” make her feel particular rather than generic. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-temperature; she leans quickly toward hope rather than being seriously tempted to give up. The final choice to persist with hope is well earned, though a touch more on-page friction at that last turn could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The curator’s motivation (forbidden yet conceptually-driven curiosity) is clear and consistent, and her interiority feels specific rather than generic. Her small contradictions—rule-bound yet willing to trespass, amused by her own bathroom superstition while depending on it—give her texture. The shift from “bewildered” to “awake” is earned through the bathroom scene and the orchard’s response. Emotional embodiment is present but could be slightly more pressured or self-implicating to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira and Kael are distinct and motivated—her linguistic curiosity and his failed-rescuer guilt are clear, and her choice to “renegotiate” instead of extract feels rooted in her established perspective. However, both read more as articulated functions of the theme than as fully conflicted people under pressure; we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion beyond awe and exhaustion. Elira in particular feels preternaturally composed and wise, with no visible blind spots tested on the page. The relational dynamic shifts (teacher–student to collaborators) but without much friction or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chimera twin’s interiority is vivid and particular, with her split-yet-fused self rendered through concrete memories and sensory cues (“a lullaby sung in two voices from one throat”). Her core motivation—to reclaim a lost self/name—remains legible and steadily intensifies as she descends. The hesitation before taking *Lirien* and the self-definition “I am both… And neither… And all” feel earned by the prior contradictions rather than arbitrary epiphany. The only minor limitation is that all relational pressure is offstage, so we never see her dynamic with the drowned twin or the humming woman in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The archivist’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistently enacted, especially in her patient, precise reweaving of the rope. However, she faces almost no resistance—internal or external—and her emotional range remains narrow, so we don’t see contradictory impulses under real pressure. Her “cost” is largely implied vocation rather than a felt sacrifice in the moment. The result is a strong but relatively low-conflict portrait rather than a deeply tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ripple-mark’s motivation and method are specific and consistent—her map-etched skin, barefoot reading of vibrations, and belief that “silence was not absence. It was architecture” feel character-particular. Her agency drives every turn, and her competence is well dramatized. However, she experiences almost no on-page doubt, resistance, or contradiction, so internal conflict and visible cost remain muted. The final endurance/renunciation (leaving after tuning the caves) is earned but emotionally underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The custodian’s motive—to rekindle understanding and prove coincidences meaningful—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her choices (seven winters of mapping, the meticulous alignment, the final whispered request). Her interiority has texture (hope, skepticism, awe) and is filtered through concrete perceptions rather than abstract labels. However, genuine internal conflict (“what if this fails; what if meaning isn’t there”) is mostly implied rather than dramatized under pressure, so her arc leans more toward graceful revelation than a hard-won, ambivalent decision. The final reconfiguration into “conduit” reads earned but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s motivation (“to sculpt identity from experience”) is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in how she reads shadows and memories. Her interiority feels distinctive—“preemptively nostalgic” toward both vanished cultures and her own erasure is a sharp, character-particular lens. However, she moves through the scene with comparatively little internal contradiction or friction; her composure undercuts a sense of struggle. The closing acceptance of becoming an archived whisper is resonant but emotionally smooth, not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motives (defying a starless hopelessness through her craft) are clear and consistently embodied in her attention to ratios, ignition, and the rag knot. Interiority is mostly externalized through perception and ritual rather than direct thought, but it still feels particular and lived-in. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or visible doubt under pressure; she rarely wavers, so her final renunciation of the rag, while earned, could carry more ambivalence. Nonetheless, her choices and sensory focus reveal a distinct, coherent character.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicler is psychologically coherent and particular—her sensory focus, relationship to the cicada, and treatment of her companion all feel lived-in. Motivation (to understand time, to sit with the relationship’s pause) is clear and her micro-choices are consistent with that. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (curiosity vs relational unease), and the argument about leaving is summarized rather than dramatized, so her conflict never quite bites. The companion is sketched effectively as pressure and counterweight, though his interiority remains thin by design.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The child’s longing for “flavors of different silences” is concrete, distinctive, and consistently motivates their choices, especially the climb and refusal to return. Interiority is vivid and embodied, with bunker silence felt as “starvation” rather than a generic fear. The final renunciation of fear and curated safety is earned by the established hunger for something else. However, the emotional cost regarding the father and the life left behind is mostly implied rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts the change’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The operator is sharply characterized through vocation, habit, and highly specific attention to others’ breathing and “textures” of sound, giving him an interior life without explicit monologue. The woman is sketched economically but convincingly through embodied detail (knuckles white, letter grip, micro-relaxations). His core motivation is clear and consistent, though the explicit statement “This was his motivation, refined over decades: to teach silence how to comfort…” slightly flattens what the scene has already shown. Emotional progression from dense fog to release feels earned and particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystal clear from the outset and tracks cleanly through every beat, and her actions (following the murals, trusting the flake, choosing a particular self on the throne) all align with that drive. Interiority is mostly carried through embodied interaction with the environment rather than explicit thought, which works but keeps us at a slight emotional remove. The final choice—selecting the version of herself “who sallied forth”—is thematically earned by prior behavior and reads as a credible, if idealized, self-definition. Some potential for richer contradiction (fear vs. desire, doubt vs. resolve) under the time pressure remains untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s inner life is rich, specific, and embodied—her silence, scars, and ritualized movements under pressure feel rooted in a coherent psychology. Motivation (returning not to beg but to offer a hard-won lesson) is clear and consistent with earlier choices like not knocking. There is some safety in the framing—she’s largely right about everything, with limited visible contradiction or ugly impulse undercutting the self-aware poise—which slightly blunts complexity. Still, the final renunciation/acceptance (“She does not look back”) reads earned and costly in context.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is specific and compelling—a pyramid scheme survivor whose mix of hollowed-out trust and “virtuously mischievous” spite credibly motivates her choice to engage with the quantum texts. Her history with exploitation grounds her decision to “volunteer to be the anchor” and to channel her own pain into the ritual. Internal conflict is present but somewhat summarized; we’re told more than we viscerally feel the clash between her hunger to believe and her fear of being used again. The change at the end (from shattered trust to committed tending of this new “harvest”) feels earned, though the emotional cost is gestured at more than deeply dramatized in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s motive—to uncover a truth that might end her dynasty—is clear, consistent, and deepens as the scene progresses. Her interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (hunterly focus, training in caves, body-as-instrument) rather than generic. The reversal from “dynasty ender” to “restoration” is emotionally plausible and earned by the earlier emphasis on her attunement to hidden frequencies. Internal contradiction (wanting destruction vs. being the rightful heir) is present but could be dramatized more through a moment of real hesitation or recoil after the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The knight’s motivation (“to capture the shape of possibility,” allegiance to the threshold) is clear and consistently embodied through his choices, especially the decision to “unsnap” and surrender control. Internal contradiction—withdrawn vs. conduit—is strongly implied, though never deeply dramatized as on-page hesitation or failure. Emotional states are conveyed through physicalized ritual rather than named feelings, which suits the piece. The final transformation from “withdrawn” to “unfolded” feels earned by prior imagery and action, though the cost of that change remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archivist’s interiority is specific and embodied—her “quiet companion” heartbreak and the way it sharpens her focus feel lived-in rather than labeled. Her micro-choices (lifting the button, killing the overhead lights, starting the “Magnifications” logbook) all arise from that emotional core. The change from archivist of loss to archivist of kindness is believable and earned, though internal contradiction under pressure is more implied than dramatized. The supervisor is thin but serviceable as a relational reflector rather than a true source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elira’s motivation and competence are sharply etched—“carefully resourceful” is both told and convincingly shown in her tool use and tactics. However, she experiences relatively little on-page internal contradiction or destabilizing doubt under pressure; her resolve feels almost frictionless. The lack of a visible personal cost or fraught trade-off at the end slightly flattens what could be a more complex character beat. Still, her worldview and habits of perception feel specific and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The saxophonist’s motivation and history are clear and specific, with the grandmother and father details giving him texture beyond a mere ritual instrument. However, his internal life under pressure remains largely unwavering—there’s little on-page contradiction or genuine doubt as he performs the act, so we see less struggle than the stakes invite. Embodied emotion appears more in setting reactions (fog, stone) than in his own body, which slightly flattens the peak beats. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but relatively serene, with limited felt personal cost beyond quiet solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and her reverent, tactile way of interacting with the world feels specific and embodied. However, she moves through the story with relatively little internal contradiction or real ambivalence—her “mossy delight” is rarely in tension with fear, doubt, or fatigue. The transformation with the grandmother feels broadly earned by prior devotion, but the emotional cost is more gestured at (weeping, moss blooming) than deeply dramatized as a conflicted trade-off. Strong, memorable character, but with a somewhat limited range of pressures on her psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply drawn through his habits, workspace, and obsession with broken mechanisms, and his shift from control to acceptance feels motivated by the compass and the admiral’s example. The emotional cost of tossing his father’s watch is clear, though it could be lingered on a touch more to deepen the felt loss. Internal contradiction (needing order yet chasing what breaks) is present but not fully dramatized in scene-level struggle. The post-cavern phase (reopening the shop) slightly flattens interior tension into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking self-directed redemption for a past refusal of mercy—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through her ritual choices. The guilt over Aris and others is embodied in the coin, the reagents, and the naming, not just told. However, her internal conflict is more linear than contradictory; once she enters the foundry, she never seriously wavers, so we see deep feeling but relatively little on-page push-pull. The final shift to “Elara the Mended” feels earned, though somewhat thematically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The collector is sharply etched through specific choices—no armor, clay flute, kneeling beside dread—so her ethos reads as lived, not labeled. Motivation (integrating grief and laughter) is clear and consistently embodied, especially in her response to the boy’s giggle and the lingering woman’s thanks. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal—she’s steady rather than strongly torn—but the “luminous ache” at the end signals a credible cost. The arc is one of enduring commitment rather than change, but it feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, particular, and organically tied to the torture backstory, with traits like proprioceptive enhancement and “geometry of suffering” feeling character-specific rather than generic. Motivation—to find the “mathematics of mercy”—is clear and consistently pursued. The shift from bracing and being defined by trauma to inhabiting “presence” reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than an unearned epiphany. The only limitation is the lack of relational pressure on the page, which slightly narrows the crucible for deeper contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator is vivid and specific—a barefoot, memory-trading translator with a credible backstory of not being believed—and her motivations (to help the historian, to work with fragile truths) are clear and consistent. Emotional embodiment (“soles remembering the sting of childhood rope burns,” the memory of the grandmother’s apron) feels particular rather than generic. Internal conflict is present but subtle; she moves through the story with near-total competence, so we rarely see genuinely fraught, contradictory impulses in action. Secondary characters (Mara, the historian) function more as catalysts and symbols than as full pressures, which slightly limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The technician’s motivation—to witness and document neglected ghosts—is specific, consistent, and drives every micro-choice from climbing to the ceiling tile to carefully bagging the artifacts. Interiority is embodied through attention to dust, light, and sound rather than abstract labels, and his gentle professionalism is well realized. The internal “burden as responsibility” conflict is present but could be sharpened by one moment where his duty to the living or to himself pulls against his compulsion to stay. The final endurance/renunciation (leaving while carrying the evidence) feels earned and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The operator’s motivation is clear and particular—an almost mystical belief that “eternity could be compressed into a moment” drives every action. Her interiority is expressed through method and perception (reading frost, handling ink and type) more than explicit thought, which works well for this cool, lyric mode. However, she moves through catastrophic events with near-total composure, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or emotional strain. The final choice to pull her mother’s moment is affecting but underdeveloped emotionally, limiting the depth of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The revolutionary’s interiority is rich and specific—his shift from failed agitator to “alive, not in triumph, but in translation” feels both earned and costly. His superstition-turned-method with the mirrors shows contradiction and adaptation under pressure. The relationship with Voss is sketched in minimal strokes but still reframes his solitude and status (from dismissed romantic to necessary collaborator). Emotional embodiment leans lyrical rather than visceral, but remains character-particular, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The repairman’s guilt, craft-obsession, and quiet tenderness are specific and embodied (“mending what isn’t torn,” the remembered lie to the grieving mother). His motivation—atonement through restoring truth to music—is clear and coherently deepens once the stone wilts. Internal conflict between shame and duty is present, though it could bite a little harder in the moment of using such a dangerous, judging object. The final shift into an avowed purpose (“keeper of unsung melodies…”) feels earned by the prior pressure and costs.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s vocation, sensory orientation, and desire for “the place where explanations fail” give her a clear, particular interiority. However, she meets little real resistance and the internal conflict is muted—her shift from seeker to “homecoming” feels more like completion of a foregone trajectory than a pressured, costly choice. The fear/awe/understanding she accesses through Riel is strong but fairly linear rather than contradictory. The final renunciation of the surface world is thematically apt but its emotional price is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply rendered through vocation and embodied detail, and her motivation—turning chaos into peace—coheres with every major action. The internal pressure between critics/monetization and a deeper communal purpose is clear, though it could surface in more in-the-moment contradictory impulses rather than in summary. Her choice to leave the sculpture and walk inland to teach others is a credible, earned reorientation of values. The piece stops just shy of probing any darker flaw or blind spot that might complicate her admirable stance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The artist’s motivation—to understand why flowers bloom at night—is clear, consistent, and credibly obsessive, and her choices (journeying to the cathedral, spending three nights there, then reconfiguring her mural practice) align with that drive. Interiority is mostly shown through perception and ritual rather than explicit self-analysis, which fits the piece’s lyric mode. The “change” is a deepened stance (from gnawing need to surrendered understanding) rather than a sharp pivot, but it feels earned. The cost—persistent solitude, wakefulness, and a life spent in obscure devotion—is present, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist is richly realized through vocation, ritual behavior, and embodied reactions (tears through salt, sleeplessness, the tactile debris-work). Motivation is clear and specific—she wants reckoning, not academic acclaim—and her choices (refusing machine decryption, deciding to “parley,” abandoning transcription) consistently express that. Internal conflict is present but subtle: she shifts from institutional habits toward surrendering control, an earned change with a cost (becoming “trapped” as witness). A slightly sharper dramatization of her earlier resistance or doubt under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s stance—rejecting nostalgia, refusing to “restore” the past, choosing invitation over control—is coherent and drives his actions from workshop isolation to diffuse community catalyst. His line to the child (“a town dies twice…”) crystallizes motive and worldview without contradicting prior behavior. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal; his loneliness versus his principled refusal of followers could be dramatized with a sharper on-page cost. Still, his choices feel particular and earned, and the shift from sole keeper of the bottle to relinquishing it lands as a credible, if understated, change.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira is sharply sketched—a “venerable oath scribe” whose archivist’s impulse feels coherent and particular—and her shift from preservation to activation is motivated by the childhood prophecy. However, her internal conflict at the moment of deciding to awaken the orchard reads relatively smooth and under-contested. We see rich sensory interiority but only a glimpse of contradictory impulses or fear of consequences. A touch more hesitation or cost around weaponizing the archive would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—“furiously tranquil” and “vibrating at the frequency where rage and peace fuse into purpose” captures a real internal contradiction on the page. Her role as last heirloom seed saver and bearer of vortex inheritance gives her a clear motive to act. Emotional response is embodied (trembling fingers, barefoot on ice) rather than merely labeled. The main limitation is that personal cost or fear—what she stands to lose beyond abstract duty—remains under-articulated, softening the impact of her final state.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tester’s vocation, habits, and values are sharply drawn through concrete ritual—climbing, calibrating, journaling—and her distrust of sirens is rooted in the Great False Dawn. Motivation (restoring trustworthy warning) is clear and consistent with her meticulous patience. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: she’s both technician and quasi-priestess, craving control yet ceding agency to the sky. The arc is more an earned endurance than a wrenching change, so the felt cost of her stance remains relatively subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The janitor’s motivation—seeking “strength in vulnerability” and reverence in decay—is specific, consistent, and cleanly rooted in his history with the Grand Celestial Archive. His interiority is concrete and embodied (the broom, the tears, the patched tunic) rather than abstract summary. He is not torn by a sharp on-page dilemma, but his chosen endurance on this forgotten station reads as a credible, costly renunciation. The backstory of the poet-astronomer and his transfer request deepens his character without feeling like info-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The recluse’s function and motivation—keeping the covenant, preserving the unsaid—are clear, with concrete behaviors like never opening the box and shielding it in storms. Her interiority is rendered through perception and ritual rather than explicit thought, which suits the mode but keeps internal conflict more implied than dramatized. The notion that she bears no name now is a strong, character-specific choice. However, we never see her genuinely tempted to break the covenant, so endurance has less on-page friction than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vey is specific, flawed, and motivated—former “bureaucrat of seconds” turned seeker of time’s texture—and their coping behavior (garage sale listings) feels character-driven rather than gimmicky. The timeless heartbeat constraint is vivid and personal, though it’s mostly summarized rather than dramatized in on-page moments of struggle. Lira is thinner but still legible, with grief and curiosity focused through her grandmother’s urn. The final shift from timekeeping to “curating echoes” is earned by prior traits and choices, though internal contradiction under peak pressure could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira is sharply etched: her ethos (“to discover beauty in the incomplete”) and her micro-choices around the boy and the kite consistently reveal character. The boy is necessarily simpler but still specific in his hollow-eyed response and gradual reawakening. What’s missing for the very top band is any real internal contradiction or instability in Elira; she is largely a finished saint rather than a conflicted person. The final stance feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific—his “brazen calm” and desire to create a monument of interspecies respect consistently shape his choices. His gently systematic behavior is well dramatized in the sparrow-rescue moment. However, he experiences little visible internal contradiction or emotional friction about dying, so his arc reads more like a steady continuation than a pressured evolution. That lack of on-page struggle slightly flattens what could be a more complex characterization at this literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s intellectual and emotional stance is sharply etched: a scientist who insists on measurement yet undertakes a quasi-mystical pilgrimage. Her motivation (to quantify “homecoming”) is consistent and drives each beat, and the final shift—accepting emergent meaning over isolatable data—feels earned. Interiority is particular (“chemistry of homecoming,” “peer review with pilgrimage”), not generic. The internal contradiction between skepticism and craving for resonance is present, though moments of insight lean a bit declarative rather than fully dramatized in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman’s motivation—restorative re-greening of a battlefield—is clear, consistent, and embodied through his rituals with seeds and languages. We get a distinct worldview and vocation, but his inner contradictions and emotional frictions remain mostly implied rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro-choices (which seed where, what language when) do reveal a values hierarchy, especially mapping seeds to specific deaths. The ending’s quiet endurance feels earned, though the cost to him personally is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bracken is vivid, specific, and movingly motivated—his evolution from “retired from finding bodies” to keeper of voices is cleanly earned from the phonograph discovery onward. His bond to the leaf and his handler grounds his actions in more than abstract purpose. What’s missing for a higher score is on-page contradiction: there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine resistance once the new vocation appears, so his interiority feels slightly too smooth. The settlement folks, including Veyra, are sketched effectively but remain functional rather than pressure-bearing on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Her characterization is rich and specific: the “blessed pariah” torn between anchor and current, normalcy and curiosity, plays through concrete micro-choices (staying, sketching, attending to the anomaly). Interiority is textured and embodied (“breath misting,” the warmth of the compass) rather than label-only. The family history and parental pressure (“They need anchors… not anomalies”) give her stance real cost. The final endurance—choosing to remain the curious witness in the frozen world—feels earned and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elric’s motivation—to amend a skewed world rather than seek dominion—is specific and consistent, and his reverence when swapping the pieces (“whispering apologies to the old truths”) gives him texture beyond a stock rogue. However, internal contradiction and on-page struggle are relatively light; he feels confident and serenely reverent rather than genuinely torn, so the final “surrender” costs him little. Still, his micro-choices (bringing his own pieces, choosing amendment over victory) clearly express a hierarchy of values. The endurance of his stance, rather than its transformation, provides the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to move from staged crisis to witness of “small gestures”—is clear and governs their choices, especially the refusal to bow and the commitment to the walking ritual. Interiority is specific and non-generic, but simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure are more implied than dramatized. The crisis-actor backstory is evocative yet mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete moment where their old reflexes fight the new role. Still, the final stance (continuing to walk, demanding “listen”) feels earned by prior pages.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seer’s longing, weariness, and quiet desperation are specific and embodied (“mercury in her veins from liquid prophecy to quiet certainty”). Her motivation to reconfigure “home” is clear and consistent, and the final renunciation of the stone feels earned by prior lifetimes of outward-directed work. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively muted; she moves toward the ritual with little on-page resistance or competing impulse. A touch more visible ambivalence in the climactic beat could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is specific and textured—the mix of professional pattern-thinking and private guilt feels particular, not generic. Her core motivation (self-forgiveness for the ruined pupil) is clear and consistently drives each choice, from entering the labyrinth to engaging the tapestries to facing the mirror. The final stance shift (“Her exile was not revoked. / It was irrelevant.”) is earned by the prior work with the threads and hush, and carries visible cost in accepting permanent external consequence. The only limit is that internal contradiction under peak pressure could be sharpened further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The artist’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent—her trembling over “what she intended to do before the ritual” sets up a credible internal conflict between obedience and devotion to complexity. Her mischief history (“swap grave markers for garden stones”) grounds the later, higher-stakes refusal. The final choice to stay atop the tower and refuse a unified parable feels earned by her earlier refracting practice and articulated beliefs about forgiveness. Cost is implied (defying elders/rite) rather than deeply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to conjure meaning rather than power—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her choices, especially the decision to fuse her own wounds to the statue’s. Interiority is textured and particular (“for the child I couldn’t save,” “for the love I let rot”), with her flaw as a breaker-who-wants-to-heal complicating every move. Internal conflict is credible: she acts under terror and grief while refusing the easier options of retreat or numbness. The only slight limitation is that some insights verge on essayistic clarity rather than messier, more conflicted self-perception under this degree of stress.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quay painter’s interior life is specific, coherent, and convincingly textured: the cracked mirror, the seashell, and the wrong turn all grow organically from her long-standing promise to herself. Her emotional state is embodied through concrete interactions with place and objects (the satchel, the cave wall, the shell as “witness”). The final renunciation—leaving the shell and no longer needing the mirror—feels earned and carries a visible cost. The one limitation is that her contradictory impulses (escape vs. endurance, denial vs. listening) could surface in a slightly sharper on-page clash under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in her history with watching misdirected ships and her belief in “whispers” over shouts. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (“relief, thick as honey in her throat”) rather than abstract. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction—she’s anxious but never genuinely torn or tempted to do otherwise—so the arc feels more like confirmation than transformation. The cost of her choice is hinted (exhaustion, weight of responsibility) but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The navigator’s motivation—to “navigate the geography of loss” and rebuild orientation after mechanical failure—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her rituals. Her respect for the moon’s constraints shows a credible adjustment after past mistakes, and the censer foot functions as a tactile emotional anchor. What’s thinner, at an elite level, is on-page contradiction: we’re mostly told about her stance rather than watching simultaneous, conflicting impulses play out under immediate pressure. The final posture feels like an extension of an established mode rather than a sharply tested change of heart.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Her motivation—cultivating psychological safety in a world allergic to truth—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied, and her final renunciation of the glass eye cleanly pays off that drive. The involuntary-truth trait constrains her tactically (needing metaphor, silence, the eye), and the encounter with the traumatized trio reveals her values under pressure. Internal conflict (self-protection vs. ethical obligation to help) is present but could be dramatized with a bit more friction or visible doubt in the key exchange. Still, she reads as fully realized, idiosyncratic, and her change at the end is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s eccentricity, belief in “borrowed” memories, and archivist temperament are vivid and specific, and his choice to keep the flower and not report his findings tracks cleanly with those traits. His interiority is textured—he reads the world through objects and silences rather than emotions labeled in the abstract. What’s missing at this tier is sharper contradiction or on-page struggle around his final renunciation; his decision to keep the truth to himself feels apt but relatively unpressured. The cost of his stance (deeper isolation, complicity in secrecy) is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s loneliness, obsessive vocation, and buried promise to his sister form a coherent, specific psychology, and his empirically intuitive pattern-reading feels individualized. His choice to follow the ants and later to leave the shop for Lisbon clearly emerges from this setup. However, his internal conflict at the threshold (fear, doubt, potential refusal) is underplayed, so the final choice reads slightly too smooth for maximal emotional cost. A touch more contradiction in the doorway beat would deepen him into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The queen’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory—her climb is fueled by hunger for truth, buried grief, and a past attachment to power, and those threads all pay off in the grotto. Her change from ruler to “witness…vessel” is clearly earned by the accumulated images of neglect (Edict of Silence, lost child, weeping sky). Embodied emotion is consistently strong (bare feet remembering marble; starlight scorching and soothing). The hooded figure is more archetypal than individuated, but that doesn’t undercut the queen’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The alchemist’s interiority and worldview are specific and consistent, and Elias’s guilt is cleanly motivated, with their relationship clearly the crucible of the scene. Her response—curious, then fiercely receptive—feels earned by her established philosophy. However, emotional experience is often abstracted into concepts (“density of presence,” “currencies of light”) rather than allowed to get messier or more contradictory on the page, slightly muting complexity. The change at the end (reframing his guilt as needed pigment) is credible but almost too smooth, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, specific, and rooted in a coherent flaw—jealousy of past selves—that meaningfully shapes perception and choices (“I’m getting jealous of past selves again”). The profession (lucid dream chronicler) feels integrated with their compulsive need to “map the chaos” and the eventual decision to hunt and record past selves. The emotional turn from being gnawed by chaos to “braiding the threads” lands as an earned, credible shift. Slightly diagnostic phrasings (“by trade, by curse, by compulsion”) are stylized but don’t undercut authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation (struggling with fraudulence after losing smell) is clear and grounded in specific history, and her shift toward valuing presence feels earned through the visit and the clock ritual. Her interiority is concrete (touch, sound, weight of objects) and character-specific, not generic. Ren functions as a gentle counter-pressure, offering reframes that expose her blind spots without dissolving her pain. The main limitation is that her conflicting impulses under pressure are more stated than dramatized in action, so the inner struggle never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and particular—the crystallizing ink, remembered superstitions, and physical scars all anchor her psychology in concrete detail. Her motivation (reframing her scars) is clear and consistently expressed through choice: returning to outlawed rituals, humming the lullaby when the ink threatens to fail. Internal conflict—shame and fear versus longing for transformation—runs through the scene, though it resolves a bit cleanly for elite-tier ambiguity. The final shift from seeing scars as wounds to waypoints feels earned by prior beats and carries a quiet but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivations are clear and specific—she’s there to apologize for a concrete betrayal, and his hurt is rooted in an equally concrete breach of trust—so the relational crucible is strong. Her guilt, prior flippancy, and reliance on metaphor create a believable inner contradiction, and his bitterness softening into a cracked smile feels earned. Interiority is vivid but slightly weighted toward backstory and concept rather than moment-to-moment, embodied confusion or resistance during the peak confrontation. A touch more visceral, conflicting impulse in her (desire to justify vs. to confess) would push this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The end-of-history witness has a clear, specific motivation (clarity/“housekeeping”) and a distinctive sensibility, but she encounters little on-page resistance or contradiction in herself. Her surrender to being read and then becoming the hush feels more like a foregone ritual than a pressured choice with visible cost. Interiority is evocative yet largely aligned—her doubts or fears, if any, never surface in scene. That keeps the final transformation from fully earning an 8+ in character-driven venues.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The shepherd’s worldview is vivid and particular, and his actions (winding against time, counting backwards, ritualized breaths) clearly arise from that belief. Emotional texture is mostly conceptual rather than embodied, but the solitude, locals’ judgment, and his ritual seriousness give him weight. Internal contradiction is mild—he’s more monolithic than conflicted—so the “cost” of his stance is implied rather than sharply dramatized. Still, for this length, his motivation and interiority feel coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s grief, professional precision, and threshold-sensitivity cohere into a distinct psyche, and her motivation to reinterpret “intrusion detection” as “release” is clear and particular. The tactile habits around the dead laser pointer and her awareness of anchoring vs. collapse give her interiority specificity rather than stock feeling. However, the internal conflict is relatively low-friction—she moves toward letting go with minimal resistance, so the final shift feels more deepening than hard-won reversal. A bit more visible ambivalence at the peak would make the change feel costlier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in her history as the gambler/professor’s daughter, with a clear evolution from performative rebellion to a more responsible, self-authored stance. Her contradictory impulses around risk, rebellion, and duty are well dramatized through the scrawls, the lantern, and her interactions with her recovering father. The relationship with the father carries nuanced status and guilt dynamics, especially in the lantern scene and the clover exchange. The only limiter is that her final shift lands a bit cleanly conceptualized for such complex psychology, though it’s still credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The operator is sharply etched—a solitary, quasi-priestly figure with a clear ethos (“cultivated estrangement”) and a consistent pattern of choices. Her emotional life is mostly inferred through vocation and ritual rather than dramatized interior conflict, but the final self-loop hints at a deeper loneliness and desire for dissolution. Secondary characters are sketched as vivid types rather than full people, appropriate to the length and mode. The closing choice—to turn her own voice into atmosphere—feels motivated and carries a believable quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s motivation is vivid, specific, and consistent, and her occupational lens (“walnut-ink archivist of small eternal weights”) feels lived-in rather than gimmicky. Her emotional stance—composed, reverent, refusing tears to protect the ink—enacts her values without grandstanding. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or pressure; she is rarely pulled in competing directions. This keeps the arc nearer to a beautifully rendered portrait than a tested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to find a “cure for loneliness” via symbolic, reciprocal acts—is clear, particular, and consistently expressed in her choices (setting up the table, enforcing reciprocity, sharing her own pain). Her interiority is sketched efficiently rather than deeply, but details like “desperately jocular” and the bunker/monsoon memories give her credible contradictions. The man in the moth-eaten coat functions well as a crucible in which she pays a visible cost by exposing her own loneliness. Secondary figures are mostly atmospheric threads rather than pressure sources, but that suits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation (to find and map an inner stillpoint) is clear, consistent, and refracted through specific sense-experiences rather than abstract labels. Her choices—to enter the forest, to endure the resurfacing of private grief, to relinquish the ring—track cleanly from that drive. The interiority is particular (absorbing Mandarin from silk, Icelandic from a log) and avoids therapy-speak even as it edges toward epiphany. The final renunciation of the ring feels earned and costly, not tidily “healing.”

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The interpreter’s interiority is specific, paradoxical, and grounded in her vocation; lines like “confidently uncertain” and her approach of inviting rather than controlling edits make her feel particular rather than archetypal. Her motivation (“to thresh meaning from experience”) is clear and consistently reflected in how she engages with the anomaly. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-pressure—there’s little sense of her being genuinely torn or endangered by her choices—so the final stance feels more like an elegant continuation than a truly costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation and worldview feel specific and embodied (“to translate silence into music,” using sign as composition), and Silas has a clear, quiet gravitas that plays well against her. The mute girl’s entrance efficiently reframes Elara’s mission into mentorship. However, there is little genuine internal contradiction or friction—Elara never doubts, flinches, or missteps—so the emotional arc feels more like a demonstration of an idea than a pressured choice. The final cost (ephemerality, anonymity) is conceptually strong but not deeply wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is vivid and specific—a former “lending library arsonist” turned seeker whose perception is tightly tied to her history with fire and neglect. Motivation is clear and consistent, and her reverence for “volcanic tenderness” grounds her actions. However, internal contradiction is relatively muted; she moves toward her destined role with little on-page ambivalence or competing impulse. The final shift from criminal to archivist feels earned but emotionally low-friction for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Gamma-7’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and embodied, especially in her refusal to “rest” and choice to drum as quiet rebellion. The contradiction between yearning for connection and suffocation by others’ memories is strong, though slightly under-explored in concrete on-page micro-choices beyond the central ritual. Her final shift from “Subject Gamma-7” to “the weaver” feels emotionally earned by prior beats. A touch more friction or visible cost in that renaming would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena is sharply sketched—her ear for walks, quiet competence, and preference for whispers over shouts feel specific and grounded in her work. Her choices around the coin, the map, and Ruiz are motivated and coherent. However, she encounters little internal contradiction or genuine risk; the outcome feels like an easy alignment with a long-held principle rather than a pressured test of it. The resolution lacks a visible personal cost or moral friction that would deepen her characterization to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian is vivid, coherent, and psychologically legible; her vow of silence, ritual care with tools, and memory of the boy create a strong sense of interiority without explicit monologue. Motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices around the mirror and shutters feel grounded in that ethos. What’s missing for the very top tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost—she’s composed and assured throughout, with little friction between impulses. The drowned woman is more symbolic presence than character, which suits the piece but limits relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s vocation, temperament, and mission are vivid and particular—the “gardener of second chances” who coaches chess and organizes spectral window revolts is memorable and coherent. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices (testing the grotto, then escalating town-wide) track cleanly with that motive. However, she faces virtually no internal contradiction or real risk; there’s little sense of doubt, fear, or meaningful sacrifice. The ending’s shift from hiding the grotto to honoring it is more gentle affirmation than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and specific—“she believed in muscle memory, in tide charts, in the way grief settles into bone like barnacles” grounds her as a particular person, not an archetype. Her motivation to shed the “lie” of a small life and answer the island’s call is clear and consistently dramatized through micro-choices (wading deeper despite fear, relinquishing the scrimshaw). The decisive change into a healer of souls feels earned, with cost implied in the renunciation of her old self-concept. A slight softness comes from a few declarative identity lines (“she was not meant to mend nets but to mend souls”) that state her realization more than dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The performer is sharply drawn through behavior and ritual rather than introspective label, which suits the emotional void premise. Motivation—preserving grief under a regime of enforced joy while staying technically compliant—is clear and governs all major actions. The moral ambiguity of performing compliance while hollowing themselves out is effective, though contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in direct internal struggle. The “I miss you” whisper arrives as a powerful leak of feeling but could land even harder if we saw more on-page friction between their blank performance and buried attachment earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motive—“the simple, savage need to touch what had been declared untouchable”—is vivid and consistent, and her arc from trembling at the threshold to becoming “the threshold itself” is cleanly earned. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, barefoot on marble, palms “scorched” by awe) and character-specific rather than generic. However, internal conflict stays relatively gentle; contradictory impulses (fear/desire, reverence/transgression) are present but never sharply dramatized under pressure. The final stance feels credible but not hard-won on the page, which keeps this just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s perception-by-texture and his salvage ethic make him sharply particular, and his quiet agency (finding, listening, placing, bartering) is consistent and motivating throughout. Marta has a compact but real arc from amused gatekeeper to student and co-creator, with the “Teach me” / “Not me. The plants.” exchange crystallizing their dynamic. What’s missing at this tier is genuine friction or contradictory impulse—Elias never seems to doubt, falter, or pay a personal price, so his inner life stays slightly idealized. The final choice to “wake the kiln” is earned but emotionally low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation and vocation are clear and particular, and her actions (placing the lens, striking the fork, choosing to sing) align with that calling. Interiority is conveyed more via lyrical narration than conflicting impulses; she rarely feels under true pressure, so we don’t see many contradictory drives or costs. Her weeping at the released harmonies registers as recognition rather than a hard-won moral or emotional tradeoff. Strong, but more a vivid emblematic figure than a fully pressured psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mourner’s motivation—to reroute grief into small, anonymous offerings—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through her meticulous rituals. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“grief had scraped her soul to marrow”; “her fingers tracing the cold brass rim”), and the professional detail of mourning jewelry deepens her particularity. However, while we feel an ongoing state of earned stasis, the piece stops short of a sharper before/after shift in her internal stance during the on-page window. The result is exquisitely rendered endurance rather than a fully escalated internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cartomancer’s vocation, temperament, and methods are sharply drawn, and her motivation—to map post-collapse cultural patterns—is coherent and consistent. However, she experiences minimal on-page internal conflict; her stance doesn’t face a truly testing choice, so we see steadiness more than contradiction. The visitor functions more as a thematic mirror than as pressure on her, limiting relational dynamics. The closing nod and resumed measuring feel earned but low-cost, more confirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s motivation is vivid, specific, and organically escalated—from abstract “forbidden knowledge” to the visceral wound of her child’s silence. Her internal conflict between the urge to purify and the danger of drowning in nostalgia is dramatized in concrete actions (her erratic steps, off‑key humming, bloodied palms). The final stance shift—accepting grief without letting it own her—feels earned by what came before. The only minor limit is that we see her largely in a single heroic register, with relatively little pettiness or selfishness to complicate her.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motivation—to preserve a more rigorous, fear-tempered hope—is clear and consistently embodied in what she notices and ultimately does with the stone. Her interiority is specific and tied to sensory anchors (the warming stone, the pulsing books), avoiding stock emotion labels. The major choice (embedding the stone in the archive) is well prepared by her long, patient “hunt” and the prior realization about metamorphosed hope. The piece could reach higher if her internal conflict—between preservation and acceptance of change—were put under sharper, more contradictory pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interior conflict between self-respect and compassion is sharply realized and consistently drives her micro-choices, especially in the ritual of reconstructing the tail and in the final decision to resign and testify. Her emotions are largely embodied in concrete detail—handling the tail, recalling specific animal interactions—rather than generic summary. The contradiction of wanting to withdraw yet feeling bound to the animals is active on the page, not merely stated. The only limit is a slightly tidy self-awareness in the late thematic framing (e.g., “She wouldn’t call it redemption”), which trims some messiness from what could feel even more humanly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is specific and embodied—the trembling fingers on the scar, the weeping at the seed’s memories—and her arc from “closure seeker” to accepting continuation is earned by successive revelations. Her motivations (to read wounds, to fix what’s “broken”) are coherent and drive every choice, though the backstory of the surgery and prior grief collapse is gestured at more than dramatized. Contradictory impulses—wanting closure yet being drawn to living, ongoing pain—are present but could surface more explicitly in a moment of hesitation before she takes the seed. The final renunciation of her role as “closure seeker” lands as a credible, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gazer’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in concrete history (origami letters, cedar box), and her final choice to carry and release the letters grows organically from that. Motivation is clear and consistent from the first paragraph through the bus ride. The main limitation is that internal contradiction is comparatively gentle—her recognition and acceptance of the burden come without much on-page resistance or self-sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dreamer’s motivation is specific and consistent—burdened by others’ stifled creativity yet unable to turn away—and her interiority is richly embodied (“each one carved a hollow deeper into her ribs”). The contradiction between her longing for rest and her compulsion to answer the voices is clear and drives her to the archway and through the exhausting climax. Her final “rest” reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost in tears, physical depletion, and a lifetime of prior strain. The only limitation is that her inner conflict remains largely one-directional (duty over self-preservation) rather than being dramatized as a sharper on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The guard’s function and motivation are clear and consistent—engineered vigilance, cultivating potential in “unlit corners”—and his actions align with this throughout. However, his interior life is largely conceptual rather than psychologically particular; we don’t feel contradictory impulses so much as a stable, archetypal role. The softening of his shoulders at the end is a nice, understated Earned Stasis, but it lands more as idea than as emotionally embodied cost. Strong for a concept-driven piece, but not yet at the level of full, lived-in human contradiction expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The philosopher’s core drive—“to rediscover the uncharted territories within himself”—is clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially in deciding to step over the Edge. Interiority is vivid and specific (gear as key, sensing frequencies), but internal contradiction is minimal: fear of unraveling is mentioned yet never meaningfully competes with curiosity. Emotional response is more implied through poise and image than dramatized in bodily, stressed detail. The final transformation into “pioneer” feels earned but emotionally underpriced.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira and Torvin are distinct, gently drawn figures with clear, consistent motives as “wise ferry guides,” but their inner lives remain largely archetypal rather than particular. We see small embodied habits (Elira tracing moss, Torvin listening to bark), yet almost no contradictory impulses or real internal friction. The closing stance feels earned in a mythic, ritual sense but not through visible struggle. This keeps characterization strong but short of the deepest literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bellhop’s inner conflict—trauma-driven devotion to safety versus a growing, almost bodily hunger for sound—is specific, embodied, and consistent from the bolt backstory through his climb to the stain and the final choice at the piano. His motives are legible and escalate: the cerulean stain and the child’s whistle sharpen a long-standing doubt into a concrete decision. Interiority is vivid (“hands, still learning their own boundaries”) and the vow of silence tied to nerve regeneration personalizes what could have been a generic archetype. The only limit at this scale is that the shift from doubt to decisive action, while earned, comes a touch quickly and could tolerate one more moment of hesitation or competing impulse in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her quiet refusal to take the throne is an earned endurance beat that fits her established stance. However, she is almost entirely unwavering; we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses or degraded thinking under pressure. Emotional states are largely implied through atmosphere rather than embodied reaction, which keeps her a little archetypal. Secondary figures (librarian, scribe, general) function more as a chorus than as individualized pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—from coral bleaching witness to obsessive seeker of “vanished” paths—and her micro-choices (tapping, code-diving, descending alone) all grow from that wound. Interiority is handled through behavior and images rather than diagnostic language, which keeps her from feeling generic. The final renunciation—she “stopped searching for vanished paths” and instead reveals submerged ones—feels earned by the prior beats. A slightly tidy clarity to her realization keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stargazer’s motivation—hollowness after the rebellion and a need for purpose—is clear and consistent, and her sensory engagement with the environment feels embodied (“toes curled against cold alloy grating”). However, her internal conflict is relatively simple: there’s little sense of competing impulses beyond unease vs resolve, and no real moment where she nearly chooses not to engage. Her key actions (staying, looking down through the hatch, seeding the aria) align with her stated longing but don’t demand much sacrifice on the page. The figure is vivid and specific, but she remains more emblematic than fully humanly messy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grandmother’s motivation—to reclaim and evolve tradition rather than submit to Reconstruction—feels coherent and drives every choice. Her history (fever, plant-telepathy, 17 moons decoding) is efficiently sketched and grounds her competence. What’s missing is a sharper sense of internal contradiction under pressure; she never wavers or reveals a conflicting impulse, which flattens potential complexity. The final act of dispersing the “destiny” into the world is well earned but reads as principled certainty rather than a costly, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s interior life is rich, embodied, and specific, with grief, avoidance, and cautious hope coexisting credibly (“I don’t unfold it often… still carries the scent of jasmine and gunpowder”). Motivation—to recalibrate optimism via embodied presence—remains consistent and drives choices to walk barefoot, to stay with the freeze, and to resume sketching. The emotional shift from survival to witnessing is earned and carries visible cost in the first uncounted crying. A bit of therapy jargon (“somatic markers,” “body therapist”) slightly flattens the rawness but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The artist’s motivation—to descend into necessary darkness and reconfigure her understanding—flows consistently into every choice, especially the decision to stitch and then step onto the tapestry. Interiority is specific and embodied (“hands… now mapped distortions,” threads screaming, ribs as tuning forks). The arc from crestfallen to “crestRISEN” is earned by prior pain and surrender rather than a sudden epiphany. The only limit is that her internal conflict (fear vs. urge to transform) stays more implied than sharply dramatized in discrete moments.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tracker’s motivation—to understand why time slows in crisis—even to the point of self-erasure, is clear and consistent, and her “serene anger” gives her interiority specificity. Embodied details (raw pale eyes, ink on temples, breath syncing with the ink’s retreat) ground her abstraction-heavy thoughts. The final choice to test the ink on herself feels earned by prior obsession rather than a late lark. Internal contradiction is present but muted (fury vs serenity, self-preservation vs self-sacrifice), keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s motive and internal conflict—seventeen winters of suppression versus the pull to “detonate” truth—are sharply drawn and consistently dramatized. Her trembling over the letter, the calm acceptance when the guards arrive, and the refusal to flee all align with that conflict and its resolution. The relationship beat with Commander Veyra briefly but effectively shows status and fear on the other side of power. The only slight limit is that her decision to act feels largely pre-decided, with less on-page struggle at the moment of choice than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is vividly and consistently realized through concrete rituals—the sheathing of the knife, her tactile care for plants, the quiet hospitality to damaged visitors. Her pacifism feels earned as endurance rather than naïve, especially in the way she retools her father’s weapon for gentler work. The main limitation is that she verges on saintly; we don’t see much genuine temptation or internal messiness that would complicate her stance. Still, her hierarchy of values is very clear and expressed through specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fisher’s motivation (to find/catch the goddess’s echo) is clear and consistently embodied through her specialized tools and methods. Her cool-headedness under extreme sensory and metaphysical pressure is well dramatized rather than told. However, interior contradiction is only lightly implied (no strong push–pull between keeping/letting go), so her final choice reads more as ritual function than a hard-won personal evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The heiress’s motivation and temperament are sharply drawn—devoted, meticulous, morally driven—and her actions (surveilling the archive, constructing leverage, sending the blast email) align cleanly with those traits. Specific details like the grandfather’s pen nib and the father’s line about “subtract the witness” individualize her history and ethics. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we get her weariness and “orbits of regret” but little real hesitation or contradiction in the present scene. Still, her final stance—quiet, dangerous intervention rather than spectacle—feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tattooist’s motivation—hushing guilt, redeeming a past failure—is clear and consistent, and her choices (using her own blood, accepting the machine’s accusations) feel earned. Interiority is specific (letters to her seventeen-year-old self, the misaligned constellation for the grieving father) rather than generic. The piece could push her contradictions harder—her complicity versus her quasi-savior role—to deepen complexity, but what’s here is solid and emotionally legible. The final shift toward inking “maps not to lost children, but to forgiveness” is thematically apt and sufficiently prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist’s motivation—to recalibrate her relationship to noise, silence, and “the mess”—is clear and consistently dramatized through tactile choices (going to the grotto, using the tile, altering the mandala). Her socially perceptive history ties to how she experiences the whispers as textures rather than decodable messages, giving her interiority specificity. Internal conflict (fixing vs witnessing, decoding vs feeling) is present but relatively smooth; her final recognition feels earned yet slightly tidy. The emotional cost of her shift (what she relinquishes in abandoning “fixing”) is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s motivation—to redefine mercy into something active and steel-backed—is clear and consistently expressed through her ritual and speech. Her interiority is vivid but skews conceptual; we’re told about her conscience and retrocognitive burden more than we see her caught in messy, contradictory impulses in the moment. The magistrate exchange shows her values under pressure but resolves too smoothly to expose deeper conflict. Overall she feels specific and compelling, but still slightly more emblematic than fully human.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost’s motivation—refusing to fade and then choosing to release herself once she’s rekindled others’ courage—is consistent and clear. Her synesthetic perception and history at the Grand Opéra give her a particular, non-generic interiority even without direct dialogue. The internal conflict (clinging to the encore vs. accepting dissolution) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page hesitation, which slightly blunts peak emotional torque. Still, the final renunciation (“She tossed the tarot coin into the fountain”) reads earned and carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and particular—her blend of skepticism, fear she’s broken, and “willowglass hope” feels well-motivated and consistent with her choices to experiment rather than shut down. The mapping of somatic markers and her decision to open the studio to others are clear, earned extensions of her traits. Internal contradiction (skeptic vs. mystic bridge) is present but could be stressed more through moments of genuine doubt or misstep under pressure. Overall, she reads as a distinct, fully realized individual at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s vocation, rituals, and existential motivation are vivid and specific, and her key choice—to shift from detached mapping to active participation via biothermal “song”—is well motivated by what’s come before. However, her inner life remains more archetypal than contradictory; we see dedication and purpose, but little simultaneous doubt, fear, or selfish impulse under pressure. The loss of the fossil registers conceptually but not as an emotionally costly trade-off on the page. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully premium depth.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hourglass turner has a distinct worldview and vocation, and her patience, humility, and refusal of grandeur are consistent and specific. However, she reads more as a finely rendered archetype than a fully conflicted individual; we rarely see contradictory impulses or real moral friction. Her key moves—flipping the glass, decoding the echo via buttons, sharing jars—feel aligned but not costly in an embodied way. The final stance is earned conceptually, but the personal price of her choices remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motivation—to correct the record and plant a delayed reckoning rather than seek revenge—is clear, specific, and consistent with her cautious professionalism. Her interiority feels embodied (burns, aching ribs, trembling hands) and her micro-choices under pressure align with “prudently daring.” The main limitation is a relative lack of live internal contradiction or morally fraught temptation on the page; she rarely wavers once the plan is underway, which slightly flattens complexity. The endurance choice at the end (legacy over active vindication) is credible and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coachman’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his vow, habits of listening, and history of loss all clearly motivating his choices (continuing the crossing, deferring to horse and river, offering the needle). His endurance and refusal to turn or speak to the passenger until the threshold moment read as an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. The passenger is thinly sketched but functions well as a focused pressure—her grief is understood through his practiced perception rather than her own depth. Contradictory impulses are present but quiet (service vs. detachment, control vs. surrender), fitting the piece’s contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Her motivation is clear and particular—an almost mystical curiosity about places that resist change—and her micro-choices (pouring water for the bee, refusing to fire the pot, leaving the oasis intact) align with that value system. Interiority is present but tilted toward reflective/philosophical language rather than embodied contradiction; we get little sense of competing impulses or fear. The “zen-minded” quality is well dramatized through patience, touch, and attention rather than label alone. The final renunciation (walking away, leaving the vessel soft) feels earned, though the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The gardener’s interiority feels specific and lived-in, with the brother’s death and the fire giving her cautious, workmanlike relationship to hope real weight. Motivation is clear and consistent: she moves from subsistence gardening toward an almost reluctant role as steward of wonder. The final shift—accepting that “reflecting light” is her second oar-stroke—is earned by earlier details like the lockmaster’s note and her long history on the rooftop. A slightly sharper on-page moment of doubt or risk could deepen the sense of cost in her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra is vividly particular—mammoth migrations, the botanist incarnation, the reflective skin—but her inner conflict is articulated more in declarative thesis lines (“not gift, but burden”) than in moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. Her key choice—pouring her own resonance into the sundial—feels motivated by the burdened-caretaker role established earlier. The later shift from guarding extinction-coordinates to speaking new-species coordinates reads as an earned adjustment of the same core drive. A bit more embodied, irrational reaction in the crisis beat would lift this toward truly exceptional characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris’s vocation, burden of others’ secrets, and yearning for connection are clean and consistent, and his final transformation into the temple’s pulse is thematically earned. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped: once the twig spiral appears, he moves toward dissolution with almost no hesitation or pushback. Emotional states are more often asserted than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The change lands, but the path feels too smooth for this scale of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motivation and competence are sharply drawn, and her professional habits (charts, coffee, patience) feel particular and embodied. Her choice to intervene directly for once is well-motivated by past failures and present collapse. Internal conflict is relatively muted—she’s rarely truly torn, more steadily resolute—which slightly limits depth. The endurance cost (fatigue, isolation, quiet assumption of risk) is present but could be more acutely felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s fear of enclosed spaces versus her compulsion to explore them is cleanly set up (“prudently adventurous”) and paid off in the narrow-passage choice. Her interiority is specific and embodied—sweat, shallow breath, coordinates-as-prayers—rather than generic. The final transformation from claustrophobic explorer to “cartographer of possibility” is clearly motivated by the organ/compass beat, though the psychic shift happens a bit quickly to feel fully costly. Still, the before/after is legible and earned within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s characterization is specific and memorable—her tactile way of knowing people, her archival obsessiveness, and her disinterest in courtroom “justice” all feel coherent and motivating. Her micro-choices (building the quarry installation, waiting in the mist, choosing empathy with the man) track cleanly from those traits. The man’s psychology is intriguing but compressed; his pivot from secrecy to open weeping borders on convenient, limiting the sense of layered contradiction. The final choice to memorialize him facelessly is earned but could cut deeper if her own ambivalence or revulsion were more present alongside empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—proving her theories, ending exile, and honoring her great-grandfather—is clear and coherently drives every choice, and details like using fear as her “compass” give her a specific inner texture. Her embodied responses (trembling fingers, not flinching at alarms) sell her “nervously confident” state. However, some key beats rely on explanatory labeling (“She was nervously confident—not because she was unafraid…”) rather than letting contradiction surface purely through action. The emotional cost of what she does—for herself or others—is gestured at more than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fiddler’s interiority is clear, specific, and rooted in sensory experience; his regrets and need for “pixelated amnesty” feel earned rather than declared. His key choices—to play again, to interpret the hitchhiker’s disappearance as amnesty, to refuse to turn, and finally to leave—track cleanly with his emotional arc. What’s missing at an elite level is sharper contradiction under pressure: his doubts never truly bite back against his hope, so internal conflict stays more tonal than decisional. Still, the final shift from self-recrimination to “permission to be remade” reads as a credible, character-driven reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is sharply etched—criminal legacy, logistics entrepreneur, and contemplative curator of failure—with motives that cohere across the startup arc and the train-as-sanctuary. His calm, his relationship to his father’s routes, and his choice to turn collapse into pedagogy feel earned. What’s missing at this level is a sharper on-page moment of contradiction under pressure; most conflict is retrospectively resolved rather than lived in-scene. The result is rich characterization but with limited real-time fracture or messy impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicler’s motivation (redemption through witnessing others’ pain) is clear and consistently tied to her actions, from chart-reading to her lucid intervention. Interiority is vivid and particular, especially in how she reads symbols like daylilies and star pulses. However, her internal conflict—fear of being overwhelmed, doubts about her right to intervene—remains largely implied rather than dramatized under pressure. The final choice to “redistribute” burdens lands, but the personal cost to her is underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Her interiority is vivid and specific—she fears what the seed will reveal rather than the external danger—and the arc from “guarded heart” to “revealed” feels earned. Contradictory impulses (duty to find truths vs terror of self-exposure) operate simultaneously in scene, not just in summary. The final release at “She was no longer guarded. / She was revealed.” is causally grounded in the earlier fear of revelation, with a tangible cost. A minor limitation is that we never glimpse a concrete present-tense relationship; all relational pressure is retrospective.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vivid and particular—her relationship to scars, vows, and bureaucracy gives her more texture than a generic seer. Motivation (to reawaken the eclipsed covenant and reach the “intersection of dreams”) is clear and consistently tied to her actions. However, we rarely feel genuine internal contradiction or cost; she never wavers or missteps, so her final “heeding” reads more as fulfillment of function than a pressured choice. The result is strong but somewhat archetypal characterization rather than a fully human crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s interiority and worldview are vivid and particular, her “reckless idealist” / “fiercely gentle” contradiction embodied in tactile actions (bare feet in bone and earth, lullabies, card-placement) rather than labels. Kael functions as a clear ideological and emotional foil whose power and rigidity feel earned, and his small shift at the end (“Not surrender—seedling”) reads as a motivated, costly softening rather than a heel-turn. Emotional responses are grounded in the setting and stakes, not abstracted therapy-speak. The only limitation is that Elira’s recklessness is more implied than tested, so her risk tolerance never faces a truly sharp on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Jasper’s interiority is specific and textured—his fixation on catalog numbers and material properties contrasts well with the unspoken grief over the band and his ex. His avoidance of music versus longing to “listen to ghosts” creates a credible internal contradiction that drives the piece. The final choice to start Project Echo and reposition the cloth near his heart feels earned and forecloses his prior stance of total emotional insulation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motivation and professional specificity are strong—the cuneiform translator who fled three near-truth dissertations now choosing to stay at “touching distance” is a rich, coherent core. Her kindly, patient temperament is dramatized through method rather than just told. The internal conflict with ambition is mostly implied rather than sharply pressured in-scene, so we feel more serene competence than genuine struggle. A bit more visible temptation or doubt at the end could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The librarian’s interiority is specific and textured—her waxing/waning clarity, doubt about “truths or beautiful lies,” and ritual actions feel rooted in character. However, she is never meaningfully pressed; her choices (take the creel, smelt, shelve, move on) read as practiced duty rather than decisions with visible cost. Internal contradiction is gestured at more than dramatized in a live dilemma. The closing recommitment to her task is graceful but low-pressure, limiting depth of arc.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inspector’s motivation (“isolation was the true apocalypse”) is clear, particular, and shows through concrete choices—seeking the pearl, risking psychic overload, accepting the role of conduit. Her confessions expose layered, contradictory impulses (duty vs envy of the dead, love vs manipulation of her sister). The final self-crowning feels earned by those contradictions and carries a visible cost: she must carry others’ hopes instead of escaping into numbness. I’d only push for one more sharp moment where her fear of connection almost makes her abort the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s guilt, ritualized mapping, and decision to stop medication create a coherent, specific psyche with credible contradictions (clinical self-awareness vs. mystical ivy-reading). Her motivation—self-forgiveness via precision and penance—drives every action and is embodied in habits like measuring cracks and timing echoes. The sister/backstory passage is a bit expositional, but it still grounds the guilt rather than feeling tacked on. The final endurance—sleeping on the floor, then redrawing her route—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    The veiled dreamer has clear, specific motivation and a coherent inner life, and her final act of inscribing the last glyph on the mirror feels earned by prior choices. Interiority is strong but more conceptual than bodily—her emotions are implied through metaphors and objects rather than fully embodied reactions, which slightly blunts impact. The contradictory impulses (cautious vs. exultant, thief vs. archivist/architect) are present but could surface more explicitly in on-page micro-choices. Still, the transformation into the archive with visible cost (loss of individuality, acceptance of recursion) reads credible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s motives (redefining provenance, resisting imperial looting) are clear and consistently embodied in her actions, especially choosing to activate the violin rather than preserve it for the Chancellor. Interiority is specific and textured—her relationship to plants, artifacts, and the empire feels character-particular, not generic. Internal contradiction is present but mild (regret over her gift vs. calm resolve now), so her change at the end reads more as crystallization than a fraught turn. The Chancellor is more emblematic than individuated, but that works at this scale and function.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mortician’s vocation and sacred motive are vivid and coherent, and her reverence in action (“not with grief but reverence”) reads as character-specific. However, she moves through the ritual with near-perfect composure; conflicting impulses or real internal friction under this monumental choice are largely absent. The future plan to join the constellation is thematically strong but doesn’t materially complicate her present stance. This yields a powerful figure, but more icon than fully pressured person.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is richly characterized: her history as caretaker, grief, and betrayal-informed forgiveness feel specific and lived-in, and her motives for climbing and seeking contentment are clear. Interiority is concrete and rooted in objects and place (hairpin, tree, grotto) rather than labels. The final choice to re-claim the hairpin and descend reads as an earned reconfiguration, not a sudden flip. The only limitation is that her internal conflict resolves a touch smoothly, with little on-page irrational pushback once the realization arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s motivation—abandoning her rentable certainty despite professional cost—is clear, consistent, and escalates credibly under pressure from the shard and chimes. Her internal conflict between trained “ethical arbitrator” and uncertain self is well dramatized in the resistance to unhooking the cloak (“Certainty clings harder than guilt”). Bodily details (bare feet on cold rock, cloak weight bowing her shoulders, skin prickling in salt air) ground emotion. The final choice to face future clients differently feels earned by the prior inner struggle and reads as a real renunciation of a former self.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira is sharply etched: the backward aging, accumulated grief, and strategic withholding give her a specific, credible psychology whose choices drive the scene. Kael is thinner but still legible as an earnest novice whose shift from irritation to awe feels grounded. The internal contradiction—Elira as expert on vanishing yet reluctant to vanish—is stated rather than dramatized in a live dilemma, which keeps the emotional cost from fully peaking. Still, motivations align cleanly with actions, and the relationship’s status dynamic (teacher guarding power, student catching up) is clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The skimmer is more archetype than psychologically detailed person, but its motivation—lifetimes of learning stillness to serve as a guide—is clear and consistent. Endurance as Earned Stasis is well handled: “It would not journey today. Nor tomorrow.” lands as a credible renunciation with cost (self-erasure, isolation). Internal contradiction is muted rather than dramatized; we rarely feel simultaneous pulls, just resolved duty. Still, the figure’s values and choices are legible and integrated with its function.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s underachievement, refusal to automate, and stubborn attachment to hand-made magic form a coherent, specific psychology, and his choice to trust the mist after failing trust-based rituals is a strong character beat. Interiority is concrete and particular (“magic should taste like laughter or grief, not machine oil”), and the final renunciation of “great mage” status for small charms feels earned. The cost—accepting continued rejection and obscurity—is legible. Internal contradiction (fear of trust vs. willingness to step, desire for grandeur vs. turn to the humble) could be surfaced a bit more actively in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he works late “because silence spoke clearer after midnight, and he was hunting the color of sound,” and that drive coherently shapes every choice. Interiority is rich and embodied without slipping into therapy-speak; fear of “revelation, or madness” threads subtly through his actions. The internal shift at the end—from seeker to signifier, from lighting lamps to deliberately not lighting them—is earned by the ledger/vow revelation. The only small limitation is that his contradictory impulses (terror vs compulsion) stay more suggested than dramatized in direct, in-the-moment struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s surrender-to-chance ethos is specific and consistent, and the shift from abdication (“It wasn’t superstition; it was surrender”) to intentional agency is clearly earned by the static vision. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, with coins and bodily sensations (molars, temples, throat) anchoring emotions. Internal conflict—wanting to yield to entropy while still “quietly enthusiastic” about meaning—runs under nearly every beat. The only drag is a slight over-reliance on abstract formulations of purpose and resonance instead of more concretely dramatized ambivalence at the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper’s interiority is vivid and particular—his guilt over letting her walk into the storm and his compulsion to remember feel well-earned and embodied. His micro-choices (coming to the observatory, choosing to listen to recordings not meant for him, deciding to name the monsters) all align with that grief-stricken yet dutiful nature. The shift from “heartbroken” to “heart-carrier” is motivated by the ritual of naming and crystallizing fear, not handed to him as a neat epiphany. A touch more live contradiction under pressure (e.g., a real temptation to turn away from the ritual) would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mage’s motivation (to nudge a cosmic ledger back into balance) is specific, consistent, and deeply embedded in his choices, especially the months of pre-dawn study and the final relinquishing of the bell. The “lukewarm” vs. “brittle devotion” tension gives him a pleasing internal contradiction, though it never quite becomes on-page conflict under pressure. Interiority is filtered through concrete observation rather than abstract feeling, which works well but keeps emotional stakes somewhat muted. His closing contentment feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives and values are clear and character-specific—his professional vigilance versus his “precisely humane” mandate and growing reverence for memory. His decisive turn from erasing to honoring the town is well-motivated by the accumulating encounters with artifacts and photos. However, his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see much moment-to-moment struggle before the gazebo realization. The cost of his choice (risking his role) is present but lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s motivation—fear of losing herself to formula while yearning to reunite rigor and awe—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through choices like returning to the orchard and using starlings as guide rather than data. Her sentimental streak (pressed petals, the blotted tear) meaningfully complicates the persona implied by her journals. The internal change at the end from fear of erasure to “vessel” feels earned by the ritual and her surrender to wonder. The only limitation is that the conflict never bites quite hard enough to show her making a visibly costly trade-off beyond emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Watcher’s motives—preserving communal trust after past failure—are clear, specific, and consistently drive her choices. Her internal conflict between warning and over-warning is sketched efficiently through the storm anecdote. Interiority is embodied via the buckle, gestures, and attention to silence. The arc is a credible endurance/renunciation: she recommits to the burden with cost but without a large new contradiction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—escaping numbness without re-imprisoning himself in an old identity—is clear and specific, and his final stance toward the duplicate (“You are not my echo”) feels earned from prior setup. Internal conflict between his prior ego death and current desire to feel again is present but often rendered in abstract language rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The students-as-judges add relational pressure, but they’re mostly thematic mouthpieces rather than fully pressured relationships. Overall, the arc from hollowed-out survivor to someone capable of non-possessive connection reads coherent and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motives and worldview are precise and consistent: a nocturnal, porous innovator who treats the grotesque as invitation, not threat. His vow to “safeguard space for innovation” cleanly explains his choices around the seed and the escalating strangeness of the rooms. The piece is more allegorical than psychologically conflictual, so we rarely see true contradictory impulses in action, which limits depth a little. Still, the lifelong endurance he chooses—devoting decades to a seed that never blooms—reads as an earned, character-true renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conductor’s grief, ritual, and stubborn hope are specific and embodied (the leaf blower shell as talisman, the tunnel as cathedral), and his ongoing choice to return gives us clear, consistent motivation. His interiority is vivid without sliding into diagnostic language, and details like “mournfully eager” feel character-particular. Internal contradiction—his rational knowledge she’s gone versus his irrational courting of echoes—is present but could be sharpened in more on-page moments of hesitation or self-disgust undercutting the ritual. The final endurance (“He only needs the silence to keep flinching when he sings”) reads as an earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with the homesickness, compulsion toward the pendant, and evolving stance toward uncertainty all feeling of a piece. Its arc from hollow, compulsive waiting to chosen, relational waiting (“patient now, not hollow”) is clearly earned by prior images and realizations. The micro-choices—placing the pendant in the statue’s hand, not growling at the traveler, offering its paw—track cleanly with that evolution. A slight softness is that its internal contradictions (yearning for home vs. embracing emissaryhood) are more lyrically stated than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elric’s motivation is precise and consistent—interrupting a destiny of failure through a new method—and his interiority is vivid and embodied (“eyes held the bruised violet of twilight skies after storms”). The internal contradiction between “hopeless” reputation and his iterative, almost scientific hope is dramatized rather than told. Micro-choices during the ritual (adjusting cadence, adding his blood as “signature,” refusing triumphalism) reveal a real hierarchy of values. The final shift—from seeking completion to accepting perpetual becoming—feels earned and forecloses the fantasy of flawless mastery with a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The interpreter’s obsession and quiet, competent focus are convincingly rendered, and her profession-specific interiority (“not to pray, but to tune — not by adjusting dials…but by discarding assumptions”) feels particular. However, she encounters little true resistance; seven cycles of failure are summarized rather than dramatized, so struggle is mostly conceptual. The archivist relationship is only sketched, limiting relational pressure. Her final stance shift (seeing the fragment as mirror, not key) is clear and earned but carries minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The deckhand is vivid and consistent—ardent, pattern-obsessed, resiliently upbeat—and his motivation to “merge parallel timelines” is clear and enacted in concrete choices (descending alone, tuning the radio, running the ritual). His cheerfulness under eerie pressure is distinctive, but he’s almost frictionlessly competent and unconflicted, so we don’t see many contradictory impulses or a sharply felt emotional cost. The captain’s brief appearance at the end is evocative but not used as a real crucible for change. The final Earned Stasis—accepting ongoing stewardship—feels motivated, but the personal price is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The architect’s motivation is clear and consistent—she is here to “discover the texture of connection,” and every action aligns with that goal. Her calm, methodical stance under surreal pressure is distinctive and well-drawn. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visibly frayed edges as the gallery resists. The final image suggests cost (older, quieter eyes) but that cost is more implied than dramatized in her moment-to-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira is clearly motivated by necessity and professional pride, with a credible history (First Contact, surface navigator) grounding her current role. Her “balancedly curious” trait is stated and somewhat supported by how she frames risk and wonder for her students, but we rarely see her under real pressure that forces contradictory impulses to clash on the page. Emotional interiority is present but muted, tending toward concept rather than embodied reaction. Kael and the students function more as foils than as true relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tracer’s motivation (answering emotional “echoes” so they don’t fester into hauntings) is clear and particular, and the girl’s frozen grief is vividly embodied. The protagonist’s professionalism and quiet empathy feel earned, especially in the choice to kneel, tune the device, and tell the hard truth. What’s thinner is internal contradiction: we’re told she’s seen souls “fracture from listening to silence,” but we don’t feel any live fear or doubt about whether she might fail this time. The emotional turn for the girl (from waiting to letting go) is credible, though somewhat swift.

    The spelunker’s motives (honoring the unremembered, facing claustrophobia) are clear and embodied, and the final shift (“unafraid of tight spaces, for she carried open sky within her”) feels earned. Her fear and drive could be dramatized in more moment-to-moment conflict rather than mostly framed at the margins. Interiority is specific and textured, filtered through environment rather than label-speak. The throughline from her grandfather’s journals to her present choices grounds her as an individual rather than a generic explorer.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s interiority is specific and embodied (bare feet on marble, pressing the shard into his palm, tracking exact heartbeats), and his reluctant-medium role gives him a clear, character-particular stance. His motivation—to retrieve “wisdom from failure”—is consistent with his liminal status as a man bureaucratically dead. The main limitation is that his internal conflict remains relatively low-pressure; we see endurance and acceptance more than a genuinely torn choice. Still, the final acceptance of his role and the reframing of the death certificate as a “hollow” he has filled feels earned by what precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storyteller’s motivation—to resurrect the textures of a dead mother tongue—is clear, specific, and drives every on-page choice (waiting for the flock, using the diamond, enduring the risk of silence). Interiority is vivid and embodied through how she perceives sound as texture rather than abstract “feelings.” Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; her fear of the diamond’s hunger and the grief over her mother tongue don’t quite collide in a concrete choice with visible cost. Still, the final endurance—she keeps speaking through tears, grounding the sound with her copper veins—reads as an earned, character-specific act.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s bitterness, academic exile, and secret bond with the Gravity Dancer give her a clear, specific interior life, and her change from burdened to “lighter than air” feels earned by the scene’s events. Her motivation—freeing the entity and transforming her own state—is coherent and threaded from backstory into the present choice to press SEND. Moira is less deeply rendered but still distinct in voice, stance, and function as a catalytic counterpart. The main missing layer is sharper in-the-moment ambivalence or fear as the metamorphosis begins, which would deepen felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The violinist’s motive is clear and steady—reawakening beauty/silence— and her tactics (how she plays, how long she endures) track cleanly with that aim. However, her interiority stays mostly implicit in imagery rather than dramatized conflict, so we feel purpose more than a textured, contradictory inner life. She rarely seems afraid, tempted to stop, or in doubt, which blunts complexity. The final endurance (aching arm, blistered fingers) gives some cost but not a deep moral or emotional crux.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mailman’s motivation—“linking absences” and seeking the place where broken promises mend—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his choices. His calm practicality under risk, quiet defiance, and reverence for grief feel particular rather than generic. However, we see relatively little live internal contradiction or on-page cost to his stance in this specific night’s actions, which keeps the arc more steady than transformative. Marla is sketched efficiently but functions mainly as a foil and facilitator, not a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The carpenter’s motivation is unusually clear and particular—treating silence as native language and finishing the carousel as priestly duty—and his actions all align with this core drive. His micro-choices (following the bells, boarding the train without hesitation, placing the halo fragment, committing to finish the carousel) consistently reveal values. What’s missing, especially for top-tier venues, is real internal contradiction or tension; he encounters no serious doubt or competing impulse. The ending reads as an affirmation of a self that was already fully formed, rather than a change wrestled from conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian is sharply etched through specific quirks (alphabetizing by emotional resonance, humming conjectures) and a clear long-term motivation (seven-year search for the place where stories live). Interiority is largely embedded in action and image rather than explicit thought but still feels particular and coherent. The shift from seeker to caretaker (“She understood then: she hadn’t come to retrieve stories… She had come to reawaken them”) is earned, though the cost of this realization remains abstract rather than felt in a concrete sacrifice. Internal contradiction (duty to patrons vs obsession with the quest, fear vs desire) is implied more than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian’s obsession with the runaway dream is specific, rooted in history, and consistently motivates her routines and risks. Interiority is mostly embedded in the imagery of light and color rather than explicit thought, but her values (preservation, proof, reclamation) are legible. The internal tension between relentless seeking and “the hour she stopped searching and simply waited” adds welcome contradiction, though it could be dramatized more directly in-scene. The final choice to “close the palette, not to store, but to savor” feels earned and reveals a credible shift in her relationship to longing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The locksmith’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his small but pointed actions (offering the hair, tying the crimson ribbon) align with his purpose. However, he reads more as an elegant archetype than as a fully individuated person, with little in the way of contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle. The story hints at cost (vowing not to carry inherited fear) but does not dramatize inner resistance to deepen that choice. Characterization is strong for a lyrical fable, but shy of the psychological density expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The folklorist’s motivation is vivid, specific, and consistently enacted: her need “to stitch back the stolen moments” drives every choice. Her internal contradiction—surgical, almost clinical desire to recover memories versus the seduction of the orchard and her own destructive curiosity—lands cleanly in the final choice. Emotions are embodied through sensory triggers (rosewater, pipe smoke, peaches) rather than labels. The only slight limitation is that the final decision to effectively sacrifice herself is implied more than dramatized in a moment of real struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist is sharply individuated—her backward walking, fingertip annotations, and “combative tenderness” render a distinctive psyche with coherent, if oblique, motives. Her motivation to mentor resilience through difficulty is clear and consistently dramatized (e.g., with the novice and the cartographer). Internal contradiction (care vs. harshness, exile vs. authority) is present but mostly implied rather than fully dramatized in on-page interior struggle. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently and serve as effective pressure points on her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation is vivid, particular, and consistent—she “simply could not bear a world without that shimmer,” which cleanly drives every action. Her interiority is sensorial and character-specific, especially in how memories become tools, but we see little genuine ambivalence or contradictory impulse under pressure. The arc is more confirmation of identity than change, with minimal felt cost beyond quiet burden. Strong, textured characterization, but not yet at a level of complex, pressured contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The restorer’s motivation (balance rather than redemption) is clear and consistent, and her professional competence under pressure feels specific and earned. We see embodied stakes in her hesitation at the blackened knot and the way her reverence deepens into ritual. However, she remains somewhat archetypal; we don’t glimpse many idiosyncratic contradictions or personal costs beyond vocation. The emotional palette skews steady and controlled, muting potential internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—interpreting erased places with empathy rooted in family history—is vivid and consistent, and her actions (the years-long research, the choice to witness rather than rebuild, the yarrow offering) align cleanly with it. Interiority feels particular (maps as wounds, silence as vessel), not generic. However, internal contradiction is muted: she rarely seems genuinely torn between impulses, so the final emotional shift registers more as confirmation than as a choice with sharp inner conflict. The cost of her stance (what she forgoes by not “proving” or rebuilding) is present but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s analytic, death-familiar temperament and buried grief over her sister are well realized and consistently motivate her obsession with the globe. The progression from clinical curiosity to self-eroding fixation (“I stopped eating. / Stopped sleeping.”) sets up the final act of release with credible cost. Internal contradiction is present—she “dissected grief like equations” yet can trigger the globe by admitting she misses her sister—but that tension could be embodied more in present-tense hesitation at the cliff. The sister relationship remains abstract, which softens what should be a devastatingly specific final relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The balladeer’s loneliness, odd vocation, and history with the ghost are sharply drawn and feel specific rather than archetypal. Motivation (to be understood, to find sanctuary and connection) is clear and consistently expressed through her choices to climb, encode, sing, and then widen the invitation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—she shuns crowds yet actively seeks contact with a machine ghost—which could be pushed further in-scene for more tension. The final decision to “build a bridge” feels earned and emotionally grounded, though the cost of that openness is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The servant’s interiority is specific and embodied, and her quiet, task-focused agency (polishing, examining, decoding, reading) coheres with her temperament. Her motivation—seeking joy beneath anguish via the mentor’s remnants—is clear and consistently enacted. The emotional shift at the end toward acceptance and gratitude is earned, though the cost feels relatively gentle and lacks a strongly dramatized inner contradiction. There’s little sense of her being truly torn, which keeps the arc from feeling fully combustible.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s grief, fixation on clouds-as-emotion, and “quietly explosive” nature are rendered with specific, embodied interiority (“stare at an empty chair and feel the air crackle with unsaid words”). Her professional competence and obsessive ledger work align cleanly with her motive to make absence legible. Internal conflict between withdrawal and purposeful observation is present though mostly implied rather than dramatized in direct, competing impulses. The closing smile reads as an earned, modest reconfiguration rather than an unearned cure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, particular, and sustained: to “mirror the sky inside walls before the walls fell,” and every beat of her behavior aligns with that drive. Her interiority is textured through touch-based perception and the coin’s tactile reading, and the epiphany about her face blindness as a lens feels earned by prior sensory focus. Internal conflict is quieter but present in the shift from seeing her condition as deficit to recognizing its unique affordance, which reweights her acceptance of the library’s loss. The only slight limitation is that this contradiction doesn’t manifest as an on-page, moment-to-moment struggle so much as a reflective reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlen’s motivation and core trait—diligent curiosity—are vivid and consistent, and his methods (obsessive noting, phrasebook use) feel character-specific. However, he faces little real pressure or moral friction; the discovery comes without significant emotional or ethical cost. Internal contradiction is minimal, and his emotional experience under stress isn’t deeply tested because the stakes remain cozy. The relationship with Veyra adds a touch of status dynamic but is resolved almost immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she’s driven by a long, obsessive quest to reach the Hall and “uncap the final mystery,” and her answer to the voice coheres with everything we’ve seen. The internal arc from locksmith chasing an impossible fix to “keeper of quiet mendings” feels earned and forecloses the fantasy of total restoration. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (calloused fingers, seven winters with frostbitten tomes) rather than generic. This is strong work, though her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. fear, guilt vs. pride) could be dramatized under slightly sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s purpose, methods, and effect on others are clear and consistent, and Kael/Liora get just enough specific detail to feel like individuals rather than types. However, interior conflict is minimal: no one seriously doubts Elira, and we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional responses (trust, wistfulness, courage) are convincing but relatively smooth. The final choice to depart feels motivated, but not deeply contested or costly on the character level.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The adjuster’s vocation, scars, crystallized tears, and long relationship with the puppet create a specific, consistent inner life with clear motivation: to make the end gentle rather than avert it. His endurance feels earned, and the final stance (“He had not saved the world. / He had honored it.”) grows credibly from that setup. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper in-the-moment contradiction—he rarely seems torn, so we see profound feeling but not much active internal conflict. The result is powerful but somewhat stately rather than dynamically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker’s reluctance, arithmetic morality, and weary competence are sharply etched, with specific lines (“perhaps because he already smelled of resignation”) giving him texture. His motivation to keep the chorus of ghosts from growing is clear and consistent with his choices. Internal contradiction is present but relatively muted—duty vs. dislike rather than a more acute collision of impulses—so his endurance at the end feels earned but not deeply wrenching. The girl is sketched effectively in a few strokes, and her one line of dialogue nicely refracts his character.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in her dual identities as chemist and grieving mother, with clear motivation (atonement, reconnection) driving each perception and micro-choice. The shift from self-blame over the tracheal scaffold to seeing it as chrysalis-like, “a vessel for becoming, not a cage for permanence,” feels earned by the accumulated sensory and conceptual work. Contradictory impulses—scientific need for control vs. surrender to the river’s chaos; clinging vs. letting go—are present and active. A minor limitation is that her final resolution leans a bit clean and self-aware, skirting the messier irrationality that might deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The vendor’s motivation—to unwrite herself by selling clean slates—is clear, specific, and nicely mirrored in her work and rituals. Interiority is strong in isolated lines (“each sale a mirror, each customer a reflection of the void she carried”) but we rarely see her under genuine pressure or in live contradiction. Patrons function mostly as foils, not active pressures, which keeps relationship stakes low. The ending does offer a credible endurance/renunciation posture (she keeps trading pieces of her burden) but at low emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s motive is vivid and specific—“to sandpaper rough memories”—and her choices (descending, removing gloves, plunging into the basin) all align with it under pressure. Her emotional experience is strongly embodied in sensory terms (tastes, cold, burning skin). What’s missing at the very top tier is more sharply dramatized internal contradiction or serious doubt in the peak beat; she endures but rarely wavers. The final change in her relationship to her own grief feels earned but a bit smooth, with limited on-page ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, empathy, and ritual competence are vivid and consistent, and her choices directly drive the scene. However, she faces almost no genuine resistance, and we get little contradictory interiority or cost to complicate her virtue. Her decisive compassion feels more like a fixed attribute than something tested under pressure. The result is strong, appealing characterization that stops short of the complexity expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The engineer is sharply etched: obsessive, analytical, drawn to ruins of other people’s dreams, and the “helix-minded”/“chaotically precise” framing coheres with every choice she makes in the canyon. Her motivation—to repurpose grief and failure via “synaptic plasticity” and dream-archaeology—is clear and specific, not generic healing. Internal conflict is quieter: she’s already chosen this path before page one, so we see more execution of a philosophy than struggle to adopt it, which slightly softens impact. Still, the collision between the child’s submarine memory and her own lab/promotion/love history yields a credible, earned internal shift from sterile success to emotionally risky exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elira’s motivation and professional obsession are clear and consistent, and her prism-minded perception flavors how she moves through the grotto. However, her emotional life under pressure is relatively cool and abstracted; fear, doubt, or conflicting impulses are muted, so the final attainment of the Seed feels less costly than it could. The archivists’ foresight and her competence keep her from making visible mistakes or paying a sharp price. This limits the sense of deep character change, even though her stance toward vigilance is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s longing to restore sound to a hollow world is clear and consistent, and his choices—rescuing the insulator, painstaking analysis, then carving—flow directly from that motivation. Interiority is mostly carried through attention and craft rather than explicit thought, which suits the piece but keeps his contradictions and blind spots relatively soft. The emotional cost appears in the accumulated months of failure and in his tears at the end, but his internal conflict (need to create vs. fear of failure or control) could be sharpened. Still, for this length, he feels particular and lived-in, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is specific, with clear motive (seeking beauty in difficulty) and a concrete history (banished for "too thoughtfully precise" clarity). His interiority is rich and embodied through the stone, the magnetic field, and memory of pupils. However, he’s almost too serenely wise; there’s little on-page contradiction or real flailing under pressure, which softens the sense of hard-won change. The final shift to “I will find others and teach them” feels earned but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation as a pacifist archivist of silences is vivid, consistent, and clearly drives her non-coercive method (“not by force, not by lockpick”). Interiority is particular—synesthetic, tactile—rather than generic, and her village-backstory meaningfully deepens present action. Internal contradiction is relatively mild; she is more devotee than conflicted struggler, so the emotional cost of her path remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. Still, her final choice to keep kneeling in the dark, beginning again tomorrow in harsher spaces, reads as an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s sensory interiority and motivation (“to cultivate serenity within motion”) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices around the corpse flower (when to intervene, how to respond, what to replant) track well. However, she rarely experiences palpable internal contradiction or genuine risk; she understands and accepts the lesson almost too smoothly. The lack of a moment where her desire for serenity pulls against fear or doubt undercuts the sense of paid cost. Strong, but emotionally cushioned rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motivation—to understand the orchard’s resilience—is clear and steadily drives her choices, especially banking toward the glint and deciding to go deeper instead of fleeing as gravity returns. We get evocative but somewhat surface-level interiority (awe, recognition, purpose) rather than a sharply dramatized internal contradiction under pressure. Her final shift from “fixing” to “listening/echoing” feels earned by what she experiences with the arrow and the Grandmother tree. The emotional cost of relinquishing her fixer identity is present but only lightly sketched, keeping this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The investigator’s mindset is specific and convincing—his blend of technical focus and quasi-mystical respect for “singular convergence” feels character-particular. Motivation (explain Varga’s crash, prevent the next) is clear and consistently reflected in choices like planting sensors. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; the tension between “I didn’t carry it for sentiment” and the patch’s clear emotional weight never quite becomes an on-page struggle. The closing stance (stepping into the wind) is earned but reads as a continuation rather than a sharp, costly internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bell ringer’s motivation—to “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and consistently embodied in her ritual and sensory experiences. Her synesthetic interiority is vivid and particular (G-minor as burnt caramel, crescendo as velvet pressure). What’s missing for the very top tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost beyond fatigue and chosen solitude; she rarely feels truly torn. The final choice to leave with the hush inside her is earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The relic keeper’s motivation—“to harvest insights from failure”—is specific, consistent, and credibly drives each major choice, from uncasing the flute to refusing to repair the weave. Her competence and rigor (collapse logs, geomantic leylines) balance with evident restraint and humility, giving her a distinct psychology. Internal conflict (temptation to restore vs. commitment to ethical witnessing) is present but mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in on-page hesitation or doubt. The final renunciation reads earned and costly, but a touch more embodied ambivalence under peak pressure could deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The operator’s motivation—hunger to “map the unmappable” and her history of losing her own name to empathy—is vivid and particular, and her methods (borrowing personalities, using the halo) align with that drive. However, most of this is conveyed in exposition rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure, so we rarely feel contradictory impulses operating in real time. Her final walk into the dark is resonant but emotionally under-specified as a choice: we don’t quite see what concrete option she’s refusing or embracing in that moment. This keeps the character from fully crossing into truly unforgettable territory for immediate high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courier’s interiority is specific and textured—her tension between routinized duty and a reawakened capacity for wonder is dramatized in choices (taking the Hollow Market fork, revealing the pendant, letting it go). Her emotional life is embodied (“trembling not from cold but from the weight of his absence”), not label-only. The relationship to the absent mentor and the brief, potent interaction with the child both act as crucibles that force her hierarchy of values onto the page. The final renunciation of the pendant feels fully earned by prior beats and carries credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mystic’s motivation (to prove an esoteric hypothesis) is clear and consistently embodied in her methods, tools, and refusal to dramatize her own experience. Her interiority is concrete and particular—“borrowed coat” for the driver’s fear, the steady note-taking under wonder—and her final choice not to publish is credibly rooted in what we’ve seen. Internal contradiction (scientific proof vs chosen secrecy) is present but handled subtly, and could stand one more sharp moment of felt cost. Overall, she reads as a distinct, flawed, and coherent individual.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spinner’s motive—to send a message to a distant love at any cost—is clear and consistently expressed through object focus (the amber bead) and work choices (rebuilding the loom, weaving herself). Her emotional life is mostly rendered via externalized lyric description rather than sharply embodied, contradictory interiority, so her decision to sacrifice herself feels serene rather than hard-fought. The story gestures at loneliness and longing but stops short of dramatizing a real internal tug-of-war at the moment of sacrifice. The final transformation reads earned but a bit too smooth for truly top-tier psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlo’s characterization as meek yet steadfast is vivid and consistent, with his routine descents and willingness to burn through a finite resource for others giving him moral weight. His motivation—to “coax resilience from rubble”—is clear and governs all his choices. What’s missing at a truly elite level is palpable internal contradiction or struggle; he rarely wavers or reveals cost in embodied, moment-to-moment emotion. The arc reads more as an assured hagiography than a pressured psyche making difficult tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation—to uncover a withheld, reality-bending truth about her mother and herself—is clear and consistent, and her sensory way of perceiving the world feels specific. However, internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure; she rarely hesitates or believes something that proves wrong on the page. The ending realization (“some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible”) is earned conceptually but could land harder if we saw more in-the-moment ambivalence or competing impulses as she approaches the core. Still, there is a credible emotional change and a visible cost in how she must now carry responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief, reticence, and protective instincts are clear, embodied in specific habits (not reading the letters, carrying the sea glass, stacking stones). His motivations feel consistent and his final stance—carrying warmth as a “quiet beacon”—is earned. Internal contradiction (withdrawn yet devoted to anonymous connection) is present but could be sharpened in live, on-page friction rather than mainly in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The herald’s motivation is clear and particular (“the quiet, stubborn will to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”), and her interiority is filtered through concrete rituals and objects (the lantern, the feathers, the drowned poets). However, she is almost entirely in poise rather than under real pressure; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a meaningful on-page renunciation. Her prophetic power and loneliness are stated but not dramatized via a difficult choice. The character is vivid and memorable, but her arc is essentially an elegant restatement of who she already is.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dye master’s motivation (to understand story-magnetism through the lens of her donor heart and the wing) is vivid and consistent, and her eventual shift—from copying others’ magnetism to cultivating her own fractures—reads as an earned internal change. Interiority is rich and particular (“patient illumination of hidden geometries”), but most of the conflict is reflective rather than dramatized under real pressure. We get relatively few concrete micro-choices in the present moment beyond extended observation and one decisive experiment with the dye. The old man is evocative as a foil, but the relationship never comes under direct pressure, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The worker’s motivation—arboreal curiosity about what trees witness—is vivid, specific, and consistently drives her choices from tower to forest. Her gentleness and patience (“not with tools, but with patience… she listened”) give her a distinct, embodied temperament. What’s missing at this tier is any real internal friction or resistance; she moves from technician to pilgrim with very little struggle or visible cost. The final transformation thus feels resonant but slightly too untroubled for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The keeper’s motivation and role are clear and compelling, and specific memories (mother’s lullaby, grandmother’s hair-braiding song) give her some dimensionality. However, she experiences relatively little on-page internal contradiction or hesitation; her course of action feels predetermined rather than wrestled with. Emotional beats skew toward one note of aching dedication instead of a more textured mix of fear, doubt, or resentment. The final shift from “keeper of fragments” to “loom” is thematically strong but reads more as a conceptual upgrade than a hard-earned, conflicted decision.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s interiority is rich and specific, from “catalog[ing] silence between bookshelves” to re-reading her own crumpled accusation, and her arc from self-exile to quiet self-claim is credibly earned. Her empathy, shame, and longing for belonging are dramatized through micro-choices—staying in the library, hiding the invitation, then pinning it publicly. Contradictory impulses (desire for sanctuary vs. terror of judgment) are present even if not always sharply juxtaposed in a single beat. A slight tendency toward abstracted self-awareness (“wisdom often blooms brightest in the compost of error”) leans into essayistic reflection rather than fully embodied emotion at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vivid and particular: her noticing of “how loss becomes wallpaper” and her shift from passive observation to active guerrilla gardening tracks a coherent, felt motivation (seeking tenuous absolution from the earth). Micro-choices—waiting outside the tea house, placing bread on the moss, uncloaking—reveal a hierarchy of values (patience, humility, quiet resistance). The emotional texture is embodied through setting rather than stock feeling labels, which suits her temperament. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (yearning for sacredness while distrusting spectacle), which could be sharpened slightly for even more impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation—defying oblivion through meticulous preservation—is vivid and consistent, and her professional habits feel particular rather than generic. However, interior conflict is mostly implied; we don’t see her wrestle with contradictory impulses so much as steadily enact a clarified purpose. The moment where “forgiveness…recalibrated the entire Array” gives a glimpse of emotional rupture, but it’s quickly subsumed back into composure. For a top-tier venue, a bit more dramatized friction between duty, awe, and maybe doubt would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The girl’s motivation—to thwart the deal and “capture the sound of trust breaking”—is distinct, coherent, and drives every micro-choice, from disguises that failed to the final silent intervention. Interiority is concrete and particular (“fear had long since calcified into purpose”) rather than generic, and her inherited connection to the watch fob gives her a moral and emotional tangle without spelling it out. Secondary characters (Red Marla, The Chain) are sharply etched via physical detail and reaction rather than exposition. The final stance—she achieves her aim but retreats back into hush—reads as an earned, quietly costly endurance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The skeptic’s motivation (to understand weather-carriers) is clear and consistently drives her tactics, and the man’s storm-as-archive is a sharp, particularizing choice. Her internal shift from doubt to a more trusting, surrendered stance is legible and earned by the convergence scene. However, her emotional texture under peak pressure is a bit too controlled and lyrical; we get less contradictory, messy feeling than this moment could bear. The man remains more emblematic than fully individuated, which slightly blunts the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The artist’s motivation—to reclaim and release her suppressed creativity—reads clean and consistent, with embodied details like charcoal-stained fingers and the way her memory burdens her. The parental wound is specific (the stolen lock, sketchbooks called “unhealthy obsession”) and directly tied to present choices. Internal conflict between obedience/productivity and overwhelming compulsion is clear, though her emotional shifts sometimes resolve a bit smoothly for the depth of trauma implied. The final transformation into “mnemonically sovereign” feels earned by prior setup and carries a visible cost in releasing even her father’s face.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her motivation is clear, specific, and consistently enacted (finding where lost conversations go), and the wilting-near-dishonesty trait gives her interiority a concrete, embodied edge. However, we get more of a single throughline of yearning than genuinely contradictory impulses under pressure; she rarely has to choose between competing values. The emotional progression from exhaustion to relief and purpose is credible and grounded in action. The final stance—choosing to become the archive herself—feels earned, though it’s more affirmation than painful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tuner’s motivation—preserving “the color of wonder”—is clear and consistent, and her daily rituals and embodied silence render her specific rather than generic. However, interior contradiction and on-page conflict are minimal; she rarely faces a pressured choice that exposes competing impulses. The child scene gives a glimpse of her values under stress, but it remains gentle, with little visible cost. Her final “choice” to stop climbing is more reported than dramatized, limiting the sense of earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker’s motivation—to resolve “inner static” and remain tethered to its caretaking role—is clear, consistent, and drives every major choice (building the inner garden, compressing fears, choosing the burn). The interiority, though for an android, feels particular and embodied via images (creaking joints with “memory of a child’s laughter,” desert roses in its chest). What’s missing for the very top tier is sharper on-page contradiction or visible emotional cost in the peak moment; the burn reads largely as an unambiguously right move rather than a fraught trade-off. The shift from duty to chosen caretaking is strong but slightly summarized rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motives and methods are sharply drawn—she collects “stories, not trinkets,” and her choice to hum outside Leo’s door instead of knocking reveals a particular, believable temperament. Leo’s grief and hesitancy are sketched efficiently, and his emotional progression from shut-in to weeping, then laughing, feels earned, if a touch swift. Internal contradiction is present more in action than in explicit interiority, but the restraint suits the piece’s mode. The main limitation is that Elara’s inner conflict is more implied than dramatized, keeping this just shy of top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s motivation and operating mode are vivid and consistent—calm, pattern-obsessed, translating everything into code and rhythm—but she reads more as an emblem than a fully conflicted person. The piece offers clear desire (encrypting vulnerability into strength) and competence but little genuine struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. Her major choice not to board the submersible is thematically apt and causally prepared, but it doesn’t feel hard for her in the moment. The result is strong, coherent characterization with limited emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motive—to find where deleted memories go and recover her father—is clear, coherent, and rooted in specific history and habits (lantern lighting, coffee-grounds divination, flower-collecting). Her interiority is mostly expressed through method and perception rather than explicit thought, which works but keeps internal contradiction subdued; she rarely wavers or resists. The final choice to step through feels earned and aligned with her long-term drive, though the cost is held more conceptually than viscerally. Her father, when he appears, is sketched efficiently and his brief dialogue feels true to their shared code.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The summoner is clearly motivated (seventeen nights of dreams, a creed of “flow”) and her actions consistently express her vocation and temperament. However, internal contradiction is minimal: she shifts from “hush a prophecy” to “cradle a plea” without much on-page resistance or fear, so the emotional cost of that reframe feels relatively low. Interiority is particular and embodied through ritual and perception rather than labels. The final commitment to return functions as an earned stance but does not visibly foreclose a competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tutor and archivist feel specific and alive—the retired Latin instructor listening to buildings and the limping archivist with Darjeeling and riddles are sharply etched. Motivation is clear and consistent: her drive to communicate with the building underlies every choice, and his mix of protectiveness and complicity textures their scenes. Internal contradiction is mostly implied (curiosity vs. need for companionship) rather than dramatized in-the-moment conflict, keeping this just shy of exceptional. The final acceptance of key and vault feels earned but could carry more visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is rich and specific—her archiving impulse, the tension between skepticism and “charmed” receptivity, and the choice to endure rather than seek healing all feel earned. Concrete shards like “burnt toast on winter mornings” and sleeping under picnic tables embody her history. The final stance—“not healed, not whole, but sovereign”—credibly grows from her earlier resistance to sentimental comfort. At times the self-awareness borders on essayistic (“Fragility wasn’t weakness; it was the first draft of resilience”), slightly smoothing over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation—to rewrite the Binding Scroll as an act of grace and self-forgiveness—is vivid, coherent, and shows through specific choices (years of study, theft of the thorn, anonymous sacrifice). Her emotional texture is mostly resolute and reverent; we see little live contradiction on the page beyond tremors and weariness, which keeps her arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. Still, the “wisely enduring” past and her willingness to pay a cost for others give her moral complexity. The final sense of release (“soul scoured clean”) is earned by prior setup rather than feeling like a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The echo singer’s motivation—to understand why some people “echo” and to stop the theft without destroying the entity—is clear, consistent, and particular to her. Interiority is textured (training her voice to the canyon, surrendering it for days, her hollowing question), but we see little in-scene contradiction or genuine temptation to choose a harsher path. Her final choice to sing a lullaby instead of attacking the entity is well-foreshadowed and feels earned. The cost is present but somewhat under-dramatized emotionally at the peak, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The wreck-diver is vivid, particular, and clearly motivated by a non-generic ethic of “salvaging something pure,” and her methodical listening/mapping of dream fragments feels like real practice rather than label. However, she is almost wholly unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or risk in how she handles these ghosts. The final act with the snow globe feels aligned with her from the outset, so the emotional cost to her is muted. This keeps the piece from reaching the deepest bands of character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is sharply etched: her trade, contemplative bent, and reverence for hidden labor all cohere, and her micro-choices (climbing, whistling, blessing erased marks) arise organically from that core. Motivation is clear and consistent, though internal contradiction is muted; this is more a portrait of an integrated self than a conflicted one. The final “I see you” is earned by the established impulse to witness others. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper, on-page tension between competing impulses or costs beyond continued anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s drive (“to excavate truth from comfortable lies”) is consistent and governs every choice, from tracking the ‘cursed’ diamond to committing to the stillpoint network. Her interiority is concrete and particular—thrill at near-discovery layered with sorrow for buried orchards and smothered truths. We get some genuine tension between the safety of lies and her compulsion to dismantle them, even if it never breaks into a full-blown inner crisis. The final endurance choice (to keep walking, keep digging) feels earned and carries a credible, if understated, cost of isolation and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s characterization is vivid and particular—“Whisperer of Broken Signals,” meteor-ink vellum, whiskey-rough laugh—and her core motive (fidelity to the broken, opposition to Kael’s sterile unity) is coherent. However, her internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized; she never feels genuinely torn or under real emotional strain. Her final act of broadcasting feels like a straightforward extension of who she already is, with little sense of cost or risk. That keeps the arc from reaching a truly elite, transformative register.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet is specific, textured, and coherent: his jars, his past as an orphaned penny writer, and his anonymous gifting all align into a vivid personality. Motivation is clear and rooted in his history, especially the shift from survival to “translator between generations.” What’s missing at an elite level is on-page contradiction or real internal friction—his choices feel serene and foregone rather than contested under pressure. The child scene gives a nice crucible glimpse, but we never see him genuinely torn or paying a visible emotional price in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The engineer’s competence, devotion, and calm under pressure are clear and consistent, and her choices (following the ice’s song, using the key, matching resonance) drive the story. However, “logically emotional” is declared more than it is dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses under stress. Her exhaustion at the end provides some cost, but the internal arc from engineer to “keeper of balance” feels more named than deeply earned in scene. She reads vivid yet slightly archetypal rather than fully particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mapper’s motivations and values are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (staying, kneeling, mapping, teaching) all align with a “patient revolution” ethos. However, she borders on emblematic rather than fully human; we rarely see contradictory impulses or real emotional slippage under pressure. The line “She sculpted patience from impatience — not by waiting, but by witnessing” gestures toward inner conflict but doesn’t dramatize impatience on the page. The final endurance feels earned conceptually more than emotionally taxed in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The investigator’s blend of empirical rigor and openness to the tunnel’s trauma reads specific and credible, and her inherited relationship to the lantern and the city’s history grounds her motive. Her core drive—to refuse amnesia and honor preventable deaths—clearly shapes how she moves and what she records. What’s missing for a higher score is a more dramatized internal contradiction under pressure; her calm never visibly frays or collides with competing impulses in the moment. The tattooing of names and her choice to leave the lantern feel earned and costly, but the cost is more stated than viscerally struggled through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motivation is specific and consistent, and his arc from self-punishment to a tentative self-forgiveness is clearly earned by the work on the box and the promise to Maribel. Interiority is concrete (thermos, early mornings, snapped springs) and character-particular rather than generic grief. The prison-chaplain role sharpens his hypocrisy—preaching forgiveness he won’t grant himself—without feeling pasted on. The only limitation is a slightly tidy resolution of his decades-long self-loathing in a single, graceful moment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Zeta’s voice and worldview are sharply etched—irreverent, competent, devoutly curious—and her micro-choices (using the arrow, persisting as her voice cracks) flow cleanly from that. What’s missing for a higher score is real internal contradiction or moral friction; she never seems genuinely torn, only taxed. Her “reverence like static on her wingtips” hints at complexity but doesn’t evolve into a true internal conflict. The ending shows a modest shift (from execution to redesigning for the “next note”) rather than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s motivation and contradictions are clear and specific: she pursues Helios-7 under the guise of “taxonomy,” lies to everyone including herself, and gradually accepts a role beyond corporate duty. Her “brightly attentive” stance and attraction to silence feel character-particular, not generic. The main limitation is that most of her struggle is narrated in summary rather than dramatized in present-tense choices under pressure, which blunts the emotional cost. Still, her final acceptance as “anchor” reads as an earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—reconstituting her shattered courage by collecting moments of mercy—is clear, specific, and coherently expressed in action (moving from mirror to mirror, pressing the shard). Her backstory as the girl in libraries under air raids ties neatly into her present vocation and final stance. Internal conflict is present but subtle: she’s both damaged and dutiful, wary of empty “peace” yet committed to a gentler alternative. A slightly more embodied sense of fear or resistance at the highest mirror could deepen the felt cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation (“terminally curious”) is specific, credible, and consistently drives her choices from signing euthanasia waivers to volunteering in disaster zones. Her internal shift—from seeking the sound of endings to embracing thresholds—feels earned by the glacier scene and its aftermath. Embodied details (how she walks, clutching the parasol tip) keep her from becoming a pure idea. The main limitation is that contradictory impulses under peak pressure (fear vs. curiosity, self-preservation vs. surrender) are more implied than fully dramatized in the floe-choice moment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s mission and temperament are clear and consistent, and Mara’s resistance softening into a new stance feels earned. Their rapport (“poetry wrapped in dirt” / “translating a foreign hymn”) is specific and revealing. Internal conflict is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in embodied hesitation or contradiction on the page. The emotional shift at the end is credible, though somewhat streamlined and low on mess or self-sabotage for a former romantic rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line walker’s motive—to preserve the echo of wisdom—is clear and consistently embodied in her focused, gentle ritual. Her interiority is specific and sensorial rather than abstract, and the mask detail gives her a concrete symbolic contradiction. However, she experiences almost no real friction or doubt; the serenity under pressure feels a touch too untroubled for maximal depth. The “cost” of spent focus is present but understated, limiting the sense of an internal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist’s motive and temperament are clear and particular—“mending the world…one quiet arc at a time” feels character-specific rather than generic. However, she encounters little genuine friction; her interiority is more contemplative than conflicted, with almost no contradictory impulses tested on the page. Her choices (which photo to dwell on, how to interpret it) are gentle refinements rather than high-stakes decisions, so the “cost” of her stance is mostly implied. The result is strong presence but a relatively static inner arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scholar’s motivation—to map decay and patterns of growth—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her ritualized work. Her interiority feels particular (harmonic patterns, vowel clusters, dust as a clock), not generic. The final shift from pure listening/testifying to answering out loud is a credible, earned reorientation of her stance. A slightly stronger embodiment of her emotional life in the body could deepen her beyond the intellectual register.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prophet’s motive—locating the sound of aging despite his curse—is vivid and consistent, and his rituals (arranging driftwood, using chalk) reveal him under pressure. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“precognitively forgetful,” chalk as tuning fork), with embodied grief in the birthday-song moment. The conflict is largely one of endurance and compulsion rather than contradiction or choice, so we don’t see many live, competing impulses debated on the page. Still, the acceptance at the end (“That was enough”) reads as an earned stasis with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s core drive—to harness the ephemeral and reconfigure time—is clear and consistently dramatized through her vocation and choices, and the final renunciation (surrendering control, leaning into “luminous ache”) is earned. Interiority is vivid and particular (mentor’s dictum, childhood leaf), but her emotional life skews archetypal-sage rather than idiosyncratically human. The internal conflict between control and tenderness is present but mostly argued in concepts instead of dramatized contradiction in the moment. Still, her actions and motives align coherently and lead to a believable stance shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly drawn—her history as a hospice music therapist, decisively kind stance, and mission to guide one last transition all feel specific and earned. However, her inner life is relatively unconflicted; she moves from purpose to fulfillment with little visible contradiction or doubt. The realization about reunification (wholeness vs. honored brokenness) is thematically strong but arrives smoothly rather than through struggle. Emotional responses are embodied through sound and sensory associations, but we rarely see competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elira’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—an intellectual obsession rendered with nice physical beats (ink-stained fingers, nightly recordings). Her “quietly deliberate” nature shows in her refusal to panic and in the ritual repetition, not just label. However, internal contradiction and felt emotional cost are muted; she rarely seems truly torn or strained by risk. This keeps the arc from reaching a deeper, messier transformation even though the final stance shift is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to repair histories rather than punish—is clear and consistently embodied, and her “forgiving skeptic” contradiction is convincingly dramatized in her pity for the substitute and her ritual with the tooth. Interiority is specific and textured, with concrete values (apology over accusation, recomposition over erasure) shaping choices. The arc from private ritual to anticipated communal role (“she’d meet them there, kneeling again…”) feels earned as an extension rather than a sudden revelation. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; competing impulses don’t clash sharply on the page, so the cost of her stance is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and particular, with concrete anchors in trauma, craft, and ritual; her vow “to share light without using fire” coherently shapes every choice. The grandmother’s “pearl” teaching and the remembered riot give her a credible mix of tenderness, grief, and defiant quiet. The endurance at the end (continuing the ritual while re-exposed to memories) reads as earned stasis with a visible emotional cost. Internal contradiction is present but could be slightly sharper on the page (e.g., more friction between her exile/bitterness and her role as quiet guide).

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation—reclaiming and transforming a public wound—is clear and consistently embodied in her rituals (the nectar dish, the burial of the printout, the planned return). Interiority is specific and mostly shown through interaction with place and objects rather than abstract labels. However, her emotional state is fairly stable throughout, with limited on-page contradiction or fracture under pressure. The closing stance feels earned but not hard-won against visible internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The novelist’s interiority is rich and specific: her refusal to weep, her resistance to “narrative inevitability,” and her choice to begin again all feel rooted in a coherent sensibility. The conflict between market expectations and her need to honor incompletion is clear and motivates her stance at the end. Contradictory impulses (coming “not to write” yet finally writing) register, though they could be sharpened with a more acute sense of cost or temptation to compromise. Secondary figures function as cameos rather than relational pressures, but that’s appropriate to this design.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore buried sacred practices—is clear, consistent, and grounded in seventeen years of preparatory labor. Her interiority is mostly conveyed through embodied ritual rather than explicit thought, but the specificity of her tools and history makes her feel particular rather than archetypal. The main limitation is the near-total absence of internal contradiction or doubt; she moves through the scene with serene competence, which slightly flattens potential emotional complexity. The final endurance/renunciation beat (she rekindles, not owns, the past) is earned but quiet in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The alchemist’s motivation (“to translate heartbeats into maps”) is clear, embodied through her patience, care with objects, and refusal to use the flash-paper shortcut. Her endurance in the permafrost and blood sacrifice create a credible, particularized interiority. However, there’s almost no on-page internal contradiction or competing impulse; she reads as serenely single-note under pressure. The final endurance/renunciation (not using flash-paper, accepting slow ritual) is earned but thematically comfortable rather than costly in a sharp way.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s motive—to “reverse-engineer wonder” and preserve it—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his meticulous methods and choices. Interiority is mostly implied through action and perception rather than explicit thought, but it still feels character-particular (e.g., labeling shards by “emotional temperature”). Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he rejects ghosts yet treats echoes with quasi-spiritual reverence. The main limitation is that his emotional conflict remains low-key; we don’t see a sharp moment where competing impulses force a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fractal weaver is vividly realized through her embodied craft and resigned sense of duty, and the grieving father’s motivation is simple but sharply legible. Her endurance at the end (weaving her own burden) feels like an earned stasis rooted in her earlier posture toward others’ grief. Internal contradiction—duty vs. personal cost—is present but more stated than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. I’d like one or two moments where her internal resistance or ambivalence actually threatens to alter what she does, rather than remaining a lyrical description.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eleanor’s grief, practicality, and artistic impulse are rendered with specific, embodied detail (“like checking smoke detectors or labeling jars”), and her central choice—to sit with the carving instead of tending the kettle—reveals her value hierarchy under pressure. The internal arc from raw loss toward an active, studied relationship with grief feels earned. Contradictory impulses (practical vs. absorbed, haunted vs. functional) are present in scene rather than summarized. This is sophisticated, character-driven work that stops just short of truly revelatory complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in concrete regrets (“I regret trusting the carnival barker who sold tickets to ‘eternal ascent.’”). Her contradiction—compulsively collecting others’ ghosts instead of facing her own—plays through action, not labels, and the final renunciation (accepting she can only frame the past) feels earned. The emotional shift from self-lacerating regret to a quieter, non-regretting stance is credible and carries visible cost in relinquishing her old project. Micro-choices like handing over the camera embody the internal turn cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira is sharply etched as a competent, idiosyncratic engineer whose curiosity and repurposing mindset drive every choice, from noticing thermal anomalies to cannibalizing conduits. Her motivation to "resurrect" via redirected flows is consistent and credible. What’s missing at this tier is real internal contradiction or on-page cost; she rarely doubts, fails, or hesitates in ways that complicate her. The final “equations for hope” realization feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—his relationship to silence, clocks, and his fossilized scores feels lived-in rather than generic. His contradiction (content in silence vs. haunted by abandoned music) is dramatized through micro-choices like climbing the stairs “not by duty” and cradling the crystal. The final shift into humming reads like an earned, credible renunciation/return rather than an unearned epiphany. A slightly clearer on-page flare of resistance or fear before he reaches for the tuning fork could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seeker’s motivation—to understand “the architecture of lies” rather than chase treasure—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his restraint, tools, and interpretations. His interiority is concrete and particular (“he consulted it for angles—for the tilt of memory, the slant of regret”), and his final shift from chasing legends to honoring ruins reads as an earned, character-driven reorientation. Internal conflict is relatively subtle but present in the tension between his impulse to reach and his trained decision to wait. A slight over-articulation of insight (“The lies weren’t built to deceive others, but to shelter the liars”) keeps the psychology from feeling fully lived-in rather than slightly essayistic.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seed collector and Old Man Havel both feel particular and motivated, with clear, consistent desires around preservation and transmission of craft. Her patience, observational habits, and choice to “collect hands” instead of seeds mark a quiet but real reorientation. Interiority is mostly embedded in perception rather than explicit thought, which suits the mode, though genuine internal contradiction is only lightly implied rather than dramatized. The relationship dynamic—her deference and his wary testing—develops credibly through small choices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The traveler is sharply defined through vocation, habits, and the talisman thread, with a clear, consistent drive to “map absence” and orient the left-behind. Emotional life is embodied via small, particular observations (Elira’s tear on the carpet, the harbor that “forgets to wait”). However, we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or a live dilemma; they move through the piece with a stable stance rather than conflicted impulses. The closing choice (to fold and bury the crane, to map rather than hope/pray) is motivated but carries a quiet, not deeply dramatized, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prince’s motivation is vivid and consistent—his vow “to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world” roots every action and image. Interiority is textured and embodied (hollow-eyed, humming to cold metal) and his exhaustion and hope both read. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or a pressured choice; he never seriously wavers or harms anything to pursue this vow. The final endurance stance is earned but emotionally a bit uni-directional rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s internal contradiction—arsonist’s daughter and firefighter—is vivid, consistent, and drives every choice, from how she remembers the cannery to her lagoon ritual. Her motives are clear and particular (transforming shame and legacy into a different kind of service), and the firefighter competence details feel lived-in. The closure choice to bind her father’s remorse and then answer a routine call reads as an earned stance rather than a neat epiphany. A minor limitation is that her conflict is largely already integrated at the start, so we see deepening more than active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The luminous skeptic is sharply drawn through her methods and worldview—skeptical yet reverent, empirical yet myth-adjacent—and her motivation to liberate memories is clear and consistent. Interiority stays mostly externalized via behavior and metaphor (what she does, how she interprets phenomena) rather than explicit inner conflict, which keeps her from feeling fully pressured or vulnerable. She reads a bit like an allegorical function (a force of clarity) rather than a fully fallible person. The final endurance—moving on to Fountain Thirteen—lands as principled but largely costless.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sentimentalist’s motivation—reharmonizing generational harm and “sharing light without using fire”—is clear, specific, and consistent, and their micro-choices (resonance over fire, teaching the gear to feel) align with it. Internal contradiction appears in the “troubling serenity” of success that feels fragile and possibly invisible. However, the piece rarely puts them under active pressure; they face almost no resistance or genuine risk of failure. The arc reads as a graceful enactment of a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply sketched through occupation, ritual, and perception; his meditative intensity, relation to Silas, and use of the ribbon system all feel particular and embodied. The internal drive—to map “collective grief”—is clear and consistent, and the closing acceptance of grief as current rather than void is earned by prior images. However, we do not see strong contradictory impulses under pressure in the moment; his stance largely deepens rather than being actively contested. The relationship with Silas is affecting but one-note (mentor as benevolent guide), without real friction or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—an almost ascetic dedication to precise timekeeping as moral absolution—is sharply drawn and consistent, and the story gives us concrete habits (no holidays in forty-three years) rather than labels. His internal change from compulsion to surrender is well earned through the discovery of his wife’s message and the tactile moment of choosing not to wind. The embodied details of his work (quarter-hours, half-degrees of pendulum arc, microscopic grooves only he can feel) make his inner life specific rather than generic. The only slight limitation is that his contradictory impulses (duty vs grace) are more narrated than contested in real-time over multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gardener’s interiority is specific and embodied—her lullabies to headstones, the way she “maps sorrow” with her fingers, and her tears of recognition all feel character-particular. Her motivation to tend and then to reinterpret the dead is consistent and escalates naturally into the tapestry work and the final reframing of graves as thresholds. The internal shift from soothing to stirring the dead is credible and earned, though it comes with relatively little resistance or messy contradiction on the page. A touch more on what this new stance costs her emotionally or practically would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cartographer’s vocation, history (“seventeen winters”), and learned restraint (“She had once tried to force grandeur, to script revolutions… and failed”) give her a coherent, particular inner life. Motivation—to seed innovation under constraint—is clear and embodied in her ritual and the choice to write invitations, not prophecies. However, internal contradiction and felt emotional stakes stay mostly at the conceptual level; we rarely see her genuinely torn or degraded under pressure. The final act of writing feels earned but low-cost, more confirmation of an ethos than a hard-won pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The copyist’s core drive—rebellious preservation, “to teach dust to tell stories again”—is vivid and consistent, and her eventual choice to broadcast feels like a natural extension of her practiced secrecy and devotion. Interiority is conveyed through tactile detail (ink-stained fingers, tears blurring staves), grounding emotion without label-speak. The discovery that her tears are the catalyst sharpens her vulnerability into a concrete, costly action. Internal contradiction is relatively muted (she adapts quickly to the new role of transmitter), but at this length it still reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ash scatterer is vivid, psychologically coherent, and filtered through a strong, specific interior lens (ritual, mask, ashes). Her motivation—to honor and crystallize emotion rather than sanitize it—comes through clearly in both action and thought. However, internal conflict is muted: she largely begins and ends with the same conviction, so we see endurance more than a pressured change. The visiting woman functions as a catalyst and mirror but not a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation and worldview are sharply etched—his commitment to “ancient methods” and the cog as methodology incarnate makes him specific and credible. Interiority is shown through habits (pacing, muttering counter-arguments, meticulous cataloging) rather than label-only feelings. The earned stasis at the end (persisting in his subterranean project despite the monument above) fits his traits and feels motivated, though internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in a live dilemma. Relationships are limited to brief envoy encounters, so we don’t see a relational crucible deeply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply etched: the choir teacher whose identity is bound to cultivating harmony, now living in a long, quiet endurance, and her “expectant resignation” feels psychologically precise rather than sentimental. Her embodied relationship to sound (the rosette, the hum, the memory of vibration in ribs) grounds her interiority in concrete, character-specific perception. The late interaction with the girl cleanly reveals her core values—gentleness, consent, nonjudgment—through action and dialogue. The only limit is that her internal contradictions (weariness vs. devotion, bitterness vs. hope) are more stated than put under acute, in-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to transform decay into resonant, communal beauty) is clear and consistent, and her sensory gift is well-integrated into how she perceives and chooses. Interiority is textured and embodied via tastes-as-memories rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are soft: her “gentle rebellion” never truly threatens her or forces a painful trade-off. The ending stance feels earned but emotionally low-risk, which trims the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is crisply drawn—his compulsive truth-telling, story-collecting, and quiet complicity in not informing the city all cohere into a specific temperament. The woman in the waxed coat feels purposeful and distinct, with her professional, almost forensic attention to the tower. Interiority is light but sufficient; we infer more than we’re shown, yet his “wonder over explanation” stance holds consistently. The main limitation is the lack of on-page internal tension or contradiction at the peak; Elias never genuinely wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is sharply defined by vocation and sensibility; her noticing and ritual choices feel specific and consistent. Motivation—to tend the “alive” houses and resist creeping normality—is clear and drives her actions. However, there’s little visible internal contradiction or real dilemma; she meets no serious resistance, so we don’t see her values under strain. The closing stance feels like a reaffirmation more than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian’s arc from awe-struck academic to bearer of a new, destabilizing narrative is clear and motivated, especially in “The historian had spent her career chasing a single narrative.” The statue’s purpose and temperament are sharply defined and consistently expressed through its telepathy. Internal contradiction (wonder vs professional dogma, fear vs curiosity) is present but relatively under-pressured; she accepts revelation quickly with minimal struggle. The final shift—“You are the thread now”—feels earned but could carry more visible inner resistance or cost to reach top-tier nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—capturing the “texture” of a missed chance—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his micro-choices (climbing, carving, speaking proofs). Interiority is vivid and particular, especially around the dice and the arcade memory. His shift from clinging to the chipped die to integrating the regret without it reads as an Earned Stasis with real cost. The only limiter is that his emotional life leans conceptual more than bodily, which slightly mutes visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter’s motivation and temperament are crisply defined and consistently dramatized through her ritualistic work and quiet satisfaction at the anonymous note. However, she remains more emblematic than fully human: her interior conflict is muted, with little contradiction or messiness under pressure. The teenage girl at the end is evocative but thinly drawn, functioning more as sign or echo than as a pressured character. The final shared painting moment implies change (from solitary to accompanied) but the emotional cost of her prior solitude is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to rescue dying arts rather than simply survive—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through concrete actions (the lens, the bread, the documenting journal). Her characterization as a former museum guide in exile gives her a distinct worldview that colors the entire piece. Internal contradiction is subtler—she’s largely steadfast rather than torn—but the cost of insisting on art in a traumatized community is legible. Secondary figures (boy with drum, violinist, fisherman’s daughter) are sketched quickly yet non-generic, effectively reflecting facets of her project.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clockmaker’s motivation—to break fate’s arithmetic and end scarcity—is clear, consistent, and drives every action. His competence, stubbornness, and “neatly inventive” nature are well dramatized through the yoyo work and meteoric mainspring. Emotional texture is good (especially “bleak exhilaration”), but internal contradiction is only lightly touched rather than fully dramatized as simultaneous impulses under pressure. The cost he accepts at the end (carrying fate’s weight alone) is legible and earned, though still framed more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s motive—to confront and “trick” fear after coming back from drowning—is clear and consistently drives choices, from entering the funhouse to literally unbosoming. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“knot of dread coiled beneath my ribs like a sleeping serpent”). The advisor functions more as a catalytic presence than a fully dimensional character, but that’s appropriate at this length and mode. The final shift—recognizing Fear as a hunted reflection—feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation (turning obstacles into instruments) is clear and consistently dramatized in the Prophet’s choices, and the master–apprentice dynamic gives some emotional frame, but interior conflict is minimal and largely implied rather than embodied. We’re told his drive is “etched into his marrow,” yet we don’t see him waver, doubt, or pay a real relational or internal price. Kael’s awe and overwhelm are vivid but shallow, mostly reaction rather than conflicted agency until the final strike. The ending offers a mild shift (Kael empowered, Prophet exhausted) but not a deeply costly or contradictory change.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—the reed whistle as “second heart,” the ache of unanswered questions, the seventeen dry seasons of work all root her motive in lived detail. Her quiet obsession and social isolation are clear, and her final decision to climb the ridge reads as a natural extension of these traits. What’s slightly missing at this level is active, on-page contradiction—doubt or competing impulses undercutting her certainty in the climactic decision—so her choice feels intense but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The historian’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific, and her “emotionally rational” stance coheres with all her micro-choices (searching methodically, planning careful release rather than grandstanding). However, we get little genuine contradiction or pressure on her—no on-page temptation to exploit, conceal, or abandon the truth—so her resolve feels largely untested. The interiority is strong but a bit thesis-forward, more explaining who she is than letting us watch her be cornered into a hard choice. The resulting arc is more a clarification of intention than a change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and embodied in action: she’s not preserving artifacts but transmuting absence into a new kind of presence via her notes. The “firm shore surveyor” / “stoically sensitive” tension is dramatized rather than told, especially in the late breakdown over the bride’s letter. Internal contradiction is quiet but present: her ritualistic stoicism versus the emotional cost of witnessing so much loss. The arc from surveyor to “priestess of the submerged and the silenced” reads earned and costly, even if some interiority remains more implied than explored.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to trace honest origins and witness rather than condemn—is clear, coherent, and consistently enacted in her investigative choices. Her temperament and profession are well fused with her interiority, giving her a distinct, credible sensibility. However, she experiences little genuine contradiction or destabilizing doubt under pressure; her stance refines rather than truly conflicts. The endurance arc at the end reads earned but low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s grief-driven motivation is specific and consistent, and his core choice—“transform not the grief, but the vessel”—feels earned by the prior pattern of preservation. Interiority is largely implied through ritualized actions (tea, cranes, polishing) rather than explicit thought, which suits the mode but leaves some emotional contradiction under-dramatized. His final act with the sapphire is psychologically legible and ties back to the opening losses. Still, we get more archetype than fully embodied individual, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The survivor’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a clear through-line from wedding trauma to obsessive “cartography” of unused potential. Her motivation is particular and non-generic, and her micro-choices (staying alone, repurposing the observatory, initiating another dangerous cycle) align with that drive. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. scientific precision, despair vs. bleak pursuit of meaning) are present but could be even more dramatized in on-page dilemmas rather than mostly in narration. The ending stance—committing to the hunt as memorial—is earned, though it’s a crystallization more than a sharp new turn.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Her characterization is specific and embodied—the sharp-eyed, competent pilot with an almost childlike susceptibility to awe feels distinct, and her interior arc from operator to someone who can simply “be present” is earned by the chip experience. Micro-choices (ignoring the warning, opening the stone, activating the chip) track cleanly with her curiosity and loneliness. The internal conflict between professional vigilance and longing for belonging is present but could be sharpened under more visible pressure. The pilgrim functions primarily as a catalytic presence rather than a fully realized relational crucible, which slightly softens the character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s guilt, professional history, and hunger for understanding are concrete and consistent, and her interiority is vivid and embodied (the tremor, the vomiting, the way she handles the watch hand). The father memory reconfigures a long-held misbelief in a way that feels psychologically credible and costly. Her closing choice—to “weave truth” instead of lies—grows cleanly from who she’s been and what she’s just endured. The only drag is occasional explanatory labeling of her motives (“Her motivation had never been redemption”), which slightly flattens otherwise rich interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The negotiator is sharply drawn: her history (father, brother) and vocation cohere with her reflective, listening-centered approach to conflict. Her motivation—to “recycle mistakes into wisdom”—is particularized through proposing neutral ground and confronting the prosecutor about buried names. The relationship dynamic with the prosecutor is credible, with visible status history (courtroom roles) and shared grief reframing them here. Emotional states skew a bit toward aphoristic reflection over embodied contradiction, but still feel grounded enough under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The navigator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with clear tension between her old precision/control and her new desire to surrender to “imperfect motion.” Her motivation—to align heart and action—is explicitly named but also dramatized through concrete micro-choices (following the poles inland, accepting the washer, finally launching). Contradictory impulses coexist credibly: paralysis versus movement, mockery of the compass versus keeping it as talisman. The change at the end (from “broken” to “becoming”) feels earned by the prior beats and carries a visible cost in leaving shore and her former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seeker’s motivation—to rekindle empathy after voluntary memory excision—is specific, consistent, and organically tied to every choice, especially releasing the ball and leaving it behind. Interiority is textured (“not guilt, not yet—but a raw, aching proximity to pain”) and avoids therapy-speak, with credible self-loathing. The internal conflict between emptiness and the risky choice to feel again is present but could be dramatized with one more concrete, contested micro-decision under pressure. Kael functions well as a focused external pressure rather than a fully developed counterpart, which is appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The beast whisperer’s desire to “reforge a bond beyond death” is clear, particular, and consistently embodied through her choices, especially her decision to surrender to metamorphosis rather than control it. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“bone learning feather, blood learning flame”), avoiding generic grief language. Her arc—from doubt about the fortune to accepting a hybrid self with the phoenix—is credible and earned. The only limitation is that her flaws and true internal contradictions (e.g., fear of losing self vs. desire to regain the phoenix) stay mostly implied rather than dramatized in sharper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mother/cartomancer’s grief, guilt, and devotional stubbornness are rendered with rich interiority, and her motivation—to confront “lost time”—is psychologically convincing. Her choices (climbing to the glade, using the shard, entering the archive) all flow credibly from that mix of love and regret. Internal contradiction (clinging to regret vs. willingness to release) is present but could be made more sharply conflicted in the peak beats. Still, the closing surrender and return to the living daughter feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motivation and pacifist nature are specific, consistent, and drive every choice, and the emotional mechanism of Kwan Yin’s Tear is cleanly tied to her inner life. The shadow work creates a credible internal contradiction—pacifism versus buried rage—that pays off when her shadow becomes a “wing.” Some phrasing leans toward label-y abstraction (“Her shadow work…was the true thread in her needle”), but it’s still dramatized through nightly rituals and the final confrontation. The cost of her choice—leaving the ship, dissolving the Tear, surrendering the lone human body—is thematically and emotionally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The philanthropist’s interiority is rich and specific—her relationship to fear, loss, and “unlived lives” feels earned, especially when she recognizes the fourth bug as her own alternate life. Motivation (“to understand the texture of transformation”) is clear and enacted through concrete choices—detouring, opening bottles, addressing the non-glowing bug. The internal contradiction between a life of running and the possibility of staying/belonging surfaces powerfully in the chest-entry beat, though a slightly sharper on-page tug-of-war there could deepen felt cost. Overall, character reads distinctive and morally textured rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is clear, competent, and particular—her calm meticulousness and devotion to symbolic revolt feel grounded in specifics like studying light angles and guard rotations. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or reveals tension between fear and purpose, so the emotional arc remains relatively flat. Her final stance (she doesn’t need to see the uprising, only to lay tinder) is consistent but not strongly reconfigured by on-page events. The piece leans on conceptual stakes more than embodied emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The herder’s longing for understanding, his ambivalence toward his “curse,” and his bond with his grandmother create a specific, coherent interior life. His micro-choices—using precognition to sync with the eels, choosing patterns over control—are motivated and revealing. The final repricing of the curse and promise feels earned, though his internal conflict could sharpen further under more concrete jeopardy. Emotional texture is rich but leans contemplative rather than pressured, which slightly softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s motivation—to turn censorship and pain into a legible inner map—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in ritualized behaviors (the timer, the vigil, the unopened envelope). Her interiority feels particular rather than generic, with strong contradictions (furiously tranquil, both defiant and reverent toward silence). The final renunciation (choosing not to open the envelope, at least for now) is earned by those earlier patterns. The only ceiling is that no concrete prior relationship or off-page actor actively presses her in the moment, keeping the crucible purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The philosopher is sharply etched through physical detail (mechanical arm), intellectual style (“fencing with silences”), and his measured, principled demeanor; the woman has a clear, complementary presence as equal and counterpart. Their shared history via letters and marginalia gives their meeting weight without infodump. However, we get little true contradiction or internal conflict under pressure—no moment where competing impulses visibly clash—and emotional stakes stay cool. The final choice to “perform it everywhere it’s been forgotten” feels coherent but carries minimal on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Molt is vivid and specific—her sardonic shell, ink-stained habits, and cat-quoting persona ground her quickly, and Elias’s poem credibly shifts her stance. Her grief-driven “molt” feels earned by the memories of the prison library and his words. Internal contradiction is present but more implied than dramatized; she moves fairly smoothly from cynicism to resolve rather than wrestling between impulses on the page. Still, the final choice to plant seeds and sing reads as a meaningful, character-rooted change with visible cost in vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s motivation—using music to “surprise fate” and reclaim her vanished lover—is clear, consistent, and drives every on-page choice. Her strategic, experimentally-minded nature is shown rather than told (mapping harmonics, learning via disastrous fugues). Emotional texture (grief, defiance, discipline) is strong, though internal contradiction under peak pressure stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in conflicting impulses. The final act—slamming the impossible chord with a grief-tinged smile—feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s vocation, competence, and protectiveness are sharply drawn, and his doubt at the moment of activation (“What if the seed absorbed not truth, but longing?”) gives him needed depth. Motivation is consistent and specific (protecting dream-stored culture), and his meticulous cross-checking of symbols embodies that. However, internal contradiction is sketched more than dramatized; we rarely see him truly torn in action, only in articulated worry. The closing acceptance (“He had done his part”) feels earned but emotionally contained rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elio’s vocation, temperament, and mission are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices in the ritual (how he follows the compass, how he treats the lace, how he returns to the bonsai) all reveal a coherent inner life. However, he faces little visible internal contradiction or moral friction; he reads as a serene adept rather than a flawed person under pressure. The “cost” he bears is mostly implied (taking on others’ regret) rather than dramatized in his body or choices. The final stance shift—recognizing apologies as transmissible without voices—lands, but feels like confirmation of a worldview rather than a hard-won reversal.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is clear but executed through summary rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional pivot ("she wept then... kindled humility") relies on diagnostic labeling rather than embodied reaction to immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as an archetype (artist/survivor), but her interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("She wanted to discover purpose in the pauses") rather than embodied friction. The emotional arc is processed through stated realizations rather than conflicting impulses or difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is competent and distinctly motivated ("not to mourn, but to rectify"), with a clear internal landscape. However, she lacks an on-page crucible; her success with the method feels inevitable, and she faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices that test her resolve. She functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's weariness and reverence are well-rendered, fitting the atmospheric tone. However, his agency is undercut by the solution arriving fully formed "in a dream," rather than through active problem-solving or a costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elira is a consistent, noble figure, but she functions more as an archetype of resilience than a specific, flawed individual. Her motivation is explicitly summarized ("neither rebellion nor martyrdom") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires, and she lacks internal contradictions or distinct personal cost beyond physical fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The artist's motivation is clearly established ("gnawing question"), but her interiority relies heavily on negation ("not nostalgia, nor penance") rather than embodied drive. The lack of contradictory impulses or a difficult choice with visible cost makes her feel more like a vessel for the concept than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s obsession with "texture" is a compelling, specific internal drive that justifies her final choice. The pivot from the horror of disintegration to the "smiling" acceptance of the ending feels slightly rushed, relying on the "mad artist" archetype to bridge the emotional gap, but the tangible cost of her lost memories (the photos) anchors the arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and mythic, but the character lacks internal friction or vulnerability. She operates as a hyper-competent archetype ("mind unshackled," "staggering grace") rather than a person under pressure; despite being "chained," her physical movement is unhindered on the page, reducing the felt cost of her constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is vividly rendered through the synesthetic graft, making her perception unique and character-specific. The integration of grief into technical motivation is strong, though the "sister" backstory feels like a standard functional lever rather than a messy, lived complexity. The character remains somewhat static in her determination, but the alignment of ability and need is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal magical helper rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal conflict, flaws, or vulnerability. There is no cost to her actions—she operates with perfect competence and invisibility—which prevents the necessary friction for a literary arc. Emotions are labeled ("tenderness," "brimming") rather than embodied through difficult choices or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure; her internal state is described via abstract labels ("reverence," "tyranny") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "thoughtfully spirited" descriptor appears as a direct label rather than an enacted trait, and her emotions resolve too neatly into a "gloriously melting" state without the requisite struggle or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("phobia-ridden," "firmly adaptive") and melodramatic self-conception rather than embodied action. The transition from trembling fear to competence is asserted through internal monologue rather than earned through difficult on-page choices. The antagonist’s motivation (leaving clues to ensure his own downfall) undermines the protagonist's agency, making the "outwitting" feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character, lacking internal contradiction or distinct micro-choices. The specific trait "mildly obsessed" contradicts the life-or-death dedication dramatized on the page, creating a logic gap in characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal arc is lucid and the shift from purpose-seeking to belonging is earned by the loop structure. However, the interiority relies heavily on a repetitive "not X, but Y" syntactic formula, which renders the emotional progression mechanical rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elira functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or personal stakes. Her actions encounter no resistance, making her success feel preordained rather than earned through struggle or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, grounded in "gnarled" physicality and conviction. Her motivation—defending reciprocity against metrics—is unwavering and drives the scene. While slightly static due to her absolute certainty, the interiority effectively renders a worldview where memory outweighs data.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined largely by labels ("mechanically warm," "obliging") rather than embodied traits. Her reaction to meeting her scarred alternate self is surprisingly muted, transitioning instantly from observation to cool competence without a genuine emotional toll or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is a coherent vessel for the atmosphere but lacks internal contradiction or grit. Her motivation is stated ("unraveling") rather than tested by genuine resistance; she faces no difficult choices, only a linear process of discovery. The emotional experience is described ("heart full," "trembling") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s internal state is vivid and embodied, with the fever aftermath grounding her emotional vulnerability. Her decision to sacrifice the art feels earned by the prior introspection, showing a clear shift in values. The oracle functions effectively as a mirror for her internal conflict, though its dialogue leans slightly towards the convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s drowsy alertness and skepticism create a distinct, grounded interiority. Her motivation—seeking calibration for guilt rather than thrills—is compelling and drives the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a passive observer, lacking distinct contradictory impulses or internal friction until the brief hesitation near the end. While the "softened" state at closure suggests an arc, the emotional cost is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara lacks internal conflict or contradiction; she functions as a flawless archetype of the "healer" rather than a complex character. Her motivation is stated ("nurture lifelong wonder") but faces no genuine internal resistance or difficult choices, resulting in a static, low-stakes portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype (the lonely archivist) but lacks distinct interiority or internal conflict. The defining trait ("sensitively perceptive") is delivered via expository labeling rather than dramatized struggle or specific embodiment. While the final shift in purpose is clear, it feels like a plot mandate rather than a difficult choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions as a whimsical archetype rather than a fully realized character; he faces no internal contradiction or genuine struggle. His success is absolute and immediate, lacking the friction or error that reveals depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "loop pedal priest" is a compelling high-concept archetype with clear motivation, but he functions more as a philosophical vehicle than a breathing character. Interiority is conveyed almost exclusively through abstract metaphor ("paradoxes that bloom like wounds") rather than embodied emotion, keeping the stakes cerebral rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist’s internal state ("chronologically homesick") is evocative, and her drive to "conduct" memory is unique and compelling. However, the transition from "fortune cookie writer" to memory-conductor relies on summarized backstory rather than dramatized evolution, and the final smile feels slightly sentimental given the surreal intensity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels rather than embodied traits; her specific memories are listed rather than felt. The climax relies on diagnostic therapy-speak ("I ran because I thought I was unworthy") rather than dramatized emotional cost, triggering the penalty for label-speak in peak beats. Internal conflict is resolved through declaration rather than a difficult, value-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodiment of deafness via vibration is compelling, grounding her internal struggle in specific sensory experience. The shift from fearing the void to utilizing it is an earned, character-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a consistent, grounded protagonist with a distinct worldview ("order imposed on chaos"). However, the trait "credibly curious" is inserted as a direct label rather than dramatized through behavior, and his transition from lifelong solitude to high-stakes action feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.3)
    The character is defined largely by aesthetic labels ("wistful lantern broker") rather than dramatized agency. The "aromatically cautious" trait is established but offers no resistance to the scene's primary action, as she uncorks the vial without a struggle or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a flawless thematic vessel rather than a person, lacking internal contradiction, vulnerability, or genuine struggle. The attribute "ethically playful" is asserted via exposition but contradicts her solemn, sage-like behavior throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lira is an idealized figure with no internal contradictions or flaws; her perceptive abilities and motivation are stated rather than emerging from struggle. She functions as a perfect vessel for the theme, lacking the friction or "contradictory impulses" required for higher-band characterization. Her interaction with the child is tender but devoid of risk or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vael’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-rendered, but the decision feels largely made before the scene begins. The "decades of hesitation" mentioned in the narration contrasts with the smooth, unconflicted execution of the ritual on the page, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist’s shift from "shrewd" broker to sentimental philanthropist is instantaneous, lacking the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for a compelling arc. The "shrewd" attribute is stated in the opening but immediately abandoned; he faces no difficulty or temptation to revert to his established nature.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira is a clear, motivated protagonist whose desire for connection drives the narrative, but she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. Her journey is linear and unopposed; the trait "boldly sympathetic" functions as a plot bridge rather than a complex character flaw or asset under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is distinct ("midwife memory") and drives the narrative effectively. Interiority is well-rendered, though the personal stakes feel slightly more philosophical than visceral; the physical cost ("from her own pulse") lacks a dramatized consequence beyond general fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("loss was ambiguous," "unraveling of meaning") rather than embodied feeling. The protagonist observes her emotions intellectually ("if emotion could be graphed") rather than experiencing them viscerally under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted agent; her motivation is delivered via abstract exposition ("slow erosion of soul") rather than dramatized struggle. Diagnostic label-speak dominates her interiority ("archaeology of abandonment"), and she faces no genuine internal opposition or temptation to hoard the item.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's internal shift is explained via diagnostic summary ("metamorphosis... was reluctant in her") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The rapid transition from scientific observer to spiritual participant lacks earned psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to thresh meaning") is clear and drives the central obsession, and the physical toll of insomnia is well-dramatized. However, the specific trait "wryly earnest" relies on narrator labeling rather than emerging organically through interaction or choice, acting more as a shield for the author to explain her skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is legible, but the central pivot relies on a convenient lapse in memory ("She had forgotten") rather than an active choice or flaw in the present moment. The "pilgrim" functions more as a prop for exposition than a pressure-tested character, and the emotional resolution feels slightly unearned given the sudden recovery of backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elira functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct voice, or genuine struggle. Her motivation is explicitly stated in summary ("to compile fragments") rather than revealed through high-stakes choices, and she faces no friction from the community or herself.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira’s motivation is clear, and the transition from mapper to listener provides a functional arc. However, her internal state is often conveyed through abstract summaries ("sketched paths in her mind like symphonies") rather than grounded, embodied emotion. The character feels more like a vehicle for the concept than a living presence; she navigates the "mirrors of doubt" without flinching, which dampens the sense of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("sympathetic skeptic by nature," "courageously kind attribute") rather than dramatized choice. The skepticism is stated but offers no resistance to the magical elements; Elira surrenders to the sensation immediately, removing internal conflict or the potential for a harder, earned transition.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative toward the final threshold. However, the "bored immortal" persona creates an emotional distance; while the ennui is stated ("sandpapered awe"), the lack of conflicting internal impulses or hesitation makes the final choice feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions more as a symbolic archetype ("the con’s conscience") than a living person; their emotions are performed ("wept... from recognition") rather than embodied. The "nothing and everything" cost is abstract, lacking a visceral, personal price paid on the page for the transformative magic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s arc from solitary creator to collaborator is distinct and earned by the plot. However, the emotional climax relies on diagnostic labeling (“wept—not from sorrow, but recognition”) rather than fully embodying the reaction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer with a clear, embodied reaction to the "bureaucratic lie." However, his motivation feels more thematic than visceral; he accepts his "ghost" status instantly without sufficient internal conflict or struggle, making him feel like a vessel for the concept rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is rich, driven by a clear, palpable grief that motivates the central ritual. The pivot from seeking external answers to confronting internal silence is a strong character arc, though the "myth buster" persona feels slightly more like a label than a demonstrated skill set in this specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") and explicit statements of motivation rather than dramatized micro-choices. Interiority is expository, summarizing feelings ("dual allegiance splits her heart") rather than showing conflicting impulses in a specific moment. Lira acts as a vehicle for the theme rather than a living agent navigating immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a functional observer rather than a complex agent. Her motivation is stated explicitly ("purposefully curious," "quiet ache") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices. She faces no internal resistance or contradictory desires, making her a vessel for the theme rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as an idealized archetype of competence rather than a conflicted individual. She faces no internal obstacles, doubts, or difficult choices; her blindness is a superpower rather than a constraint that forces trade-offs. The lack of internal contradiction or character-specific flaws results in a static portrait where success is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist relies heavily on self-labels ("dry-witted," "subtly confident") that contradict the earnest, lush narrative voice. While the specific competence is clear, the internal landscape lacks conflict or contradictory impulses, resulting in a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is an archetypal "expert" who faces no internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses. While her renunciation of the tuning fork serves as a cost, it reads as a procedural requirement of the magic system rather than a difficult character choice earned by struggle. She is perfectly competent from start to finish, which lowers the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elira functions as a clear vessel for the premise, but her internal arc relies on summarized realizations ("She understood now") rather than dramatized emotional shifts. The transition from panic to acceptance feels rushed and smoothed over by abstract language, lacking the visceral friction of a genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is emotionally resonant but logically murky; the urgency to act "before they find the bodies" contradicts the ending where "no bodies" are found, confusing the nature of his goal (concealment vs. revelation). While his internal burden of "mistrust" is compelling, the specific mechanics of his plan and his anticipation of the search party's discovery feel inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara functions as a passive vessel rather than a protagonist, displaying no agency, resistance, or choice during the encounter. The ghost bride’s emotions and nature are conveyed through abstract labels (“lovingly venomous,” “deeply broken”) rather than dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is an idealized archetype lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she performs the ritual with absolute competence, facing no doubt or struggle that would reveal distinct character depth beyond her role.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a symbolic archetype rather than a conflicted individual; she arrives with perfect wisdom and competence, facing no internal blind spots or contradictory impulses to complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined primarily by backstory and generalized habits ("She'd watch," "She'd lost someone") rather than by a specific, pressured struggle in the present moment. Her interiority relies on nostalgic abstractions rather than the friction of a difficult choice, making her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence with no internal contradiction, flaws, or vulnerability; her struggle is procedural rather than emotional, and she undergoes no change or significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by her role and burden, effectively anchoring the mood. However, the established cost of her ability (memory loss) is explicitly waived for this specific instance ("Tonight, though, she remembered"), which undercuts the stakes of her character arc. Her journey feels more like a procedural ritual than a deeply conflicted struggle, as the internal cost is mitigated by the narrative setup.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("coded grief," "shrewdly innocent") rather than embodied reaction. The protagonist’s internal state is conveyed through aphorisms ("peace is never signed, only sutured") rather than organic thought, creating a distance that prevents deep emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elira is consistent, but her internal shift relies on a retroactive "burden of expectation" not established in the opening, making the epiphany feel convenient. The realization is delivered through diagnostic summary ("realizing her motivation had never been...") rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira is clearly defined by her occupation and competence, and the "un-fixing" arc provides a functional internal trajectory. However, her internal state is often delivered through abstract summary ("weightless terror," "surrender") rather than dramatized reaction, and the lack of difficult on-page choices limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scholar and Dr. Vex are distinct and motivated, with Vex’s internal pivot serving as the scene's emotional anchor. However, the scholar relies on archetypal labels ("charming rogue") rather than nuanced behavior, and Vex’s capitulation—driven by a convenient shared backstory—resolves the central tension too easily. The shift to a collective "neighbor" perspective later in the text dilutes the individual stakes established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is defined more by lyrical attributes ("bones hollow," "voice...tide") than grounded psychological agency. The central trait "shyly unstoppable" serves as a summary label rather than a conflicting impulse dramatized in the climactic moment, where her reaction to the postcard is immediate acceptance without visible struggle or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The caretaker is a consistent, dignified focalizer whose motivation—preservation over restoration—is clearly dramatized through her ritual. While her internal state is coherent, the struggle is largely retrospective (avoiding the mistakes of others) rather than a live, active wrestle with temptation in the scene, which keeps the character slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is a competent vessel for the concept, and her motivation ("restore trust") is clear. However, the trait "carefully reckless" is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized through a risky choice with visible cost, and the internal conflict remains relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is abstract ("harmonize conflicting values") and stated rather than embodied in a difficult choice. The character functions primarily as a vessel for the theme, and her internal state is described through stylized metaphors ("encrypted compassion") rather than grounded psychological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara functions more as a lyrical device than a fully embodied character. The backstory of "fire, betrayal, silence" and the habit of "reinvention" are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing the emotional weight of her final transformation. While her motivation is clear, the internal conflict lacks scene-level pressure or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal landscape is vivid, and her grief is palpable, grounding the surreal premise in emotional reality. However, the revelation of her own handwriting in the logbook relies on a convenient identity/time twist rather than a character-driven decision, slightly undercutting her agency. The trait "featherly determined" feels like an inserted label rather than an embodied characteristic that drives choices.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is an atmospheric vessel rather than a deeply realized character; while her motivation (belonging) is stated, she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. The transition from lonely to connected feels unearned because it lacks a visible psychological cost or trade-off; she simply witnesses a marvel and is healed.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetypal vessel than a grounded character. While her motivation is clear, she lacks internal contradiction or resistance; her journey from curiosity to epiphany encounters no emotional friction or genuine cost, resulting in a somewhat flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a consistent and distinct presence, but he functions more as a static catalyst than a fully realized character with internal friction or growth. He encounters no genuine struggle or competence limits; his interactions with the stock secondary characters (barista, teen, physicist) are frictionless successes that fail to test his motivation or impose a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic archetype rather than a flawed individual; her internal landscape is depicted through high-concept metaphors ("vessel launching verses") rather than grounded emotion. The transition from committed exile to teacher at the climax lacks dramatized resistance or personal cost, reading as a convenient shift rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a static vessel for philosophy rather than a character under pressure; he lacks internal contradiction, competing desires, or difficult choices. He begins and ends in a state of serene competence, offering no dramatic friction or psychological cost to his insights.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a sentimental archetype defined by tragic backstory lists rather than embodied interiority or specific, messy human reaction. Motivation is abstract and author-imposed ("translate pain into a universal language"), while emotions are conveyed through purple metaphors ("fault lines where grief had settled") rather than grounded psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetypal operator than a grounded character. While her motivation is clear, the narrative explicitly states "None of it broke her," removing vulnerability and internal conflict. She lacks a flaw or personal cost that makes the stakes felt; she is a perfect technician of the concept rather than a person in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("sensitively perceptive," "legacy's burden") rather than embodied agency. Her primary mode is passive observation; she lacks internal contradiction or a hierarchy of wants that forces a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized archetype of competence who faces no genuine internal struggle or contradictions. Her ability to paint with heartbeats extracts no toll, and she navigates the ritual with perfect poise, resulting in a character who feels more like a performance of ability than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elira is a consistent, dignified focalizer, but she functions as an archetype without internal contradiction or doubt. The opposing commanders are treated as props who capitulate instantly, removing the human friction necessary for a compelling psychological portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a compelling contradiction, though the "secretly sentimental" trait is stated more than dramatized through friction. The lack of hesitation or cost during the ritual makes his internal conflict feel resolved before the scene begins, lowering the stakes of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype serving a thematic function rather than a realized character. She lacks internal conflict or vulnerability; her "defiance" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her perfection ("did not flinch," "knew better") lowers stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between aesthetic perfection and moral accountability is compelling and clearly delineated. The transition from "urbane" detachment to "earned" serenity provides a solid character arc, though the "urbane" trait feels slightly at odds with the scavenger-puppet action until the deconstruction is understood.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is consistent and fully embodied in her role, but functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure. She lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; her choices (to build, to leave) feel pre-ordained by her archetype rather than forged in the scene, resulting in a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, and the transition from sculpting "hollow gods" to this redemptive work provides strong motivation. However, the required attribute "technically gentle" feels inserted as a modifier rather than emerging organically from the character's inherent movement or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a living protagonist; her transition from trauma to transcendence occurs via a passive dream state rather than through active choices or contradictory impulses under pressure. The internal conflict is resolved too neatly by the vision, lacking the "earned" quality of a decision made at a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's stoic dedication is drawn with consistency, though he functions more as an archetype of the "scholar-monk" than a dynamic individual. While his backstory actions (selling the cloak) demonstrate commitment, his on-page lack of internal conflict or wavering makes him feel static. The "neutron star" comparison in the narration creates a slight distance from his ancient, localized perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is clear, but the "scheming" trait is asserted rather than dramatized; she meditates rather than plots. The characterization relies heavily on diagnostic lists of past trauma ("clenched jaw from childhood") rather than specific, embodied memory or action in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype with a clear goal, but she lacks internal contradiction or struggle in the scene. Her motivation ("so no dream would dare flee") hints at a need for control that conflicts with her empathetic backstory ("she had once been that child"), but this tension is never tested or forced into a choice. She performs the ritual without doubt or hesitation, leaving her character static by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist is vividly realized through her specific tools (honey, spoon) and physical traits (quartz eyes). Her reaction to the hurtful vow—choosing patience over anger—dramatizes her motivation effectively. The daughter's presence is felt strongly through the props, creating a tangible relationship dynamic even in her absence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation—intellectual obsession with archival gaps—is established clearly and drives the narrative. Her internal state is vividly rendered, though the transition from high-poetic contemplation to the grounded "bathroom" quirk feels slightly disjointed in voice. The resolution ("awake") earns a shift in stance, accepting the cost of identity fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elira’s distinct professional lens ("sensing linguistic strata") creates a strong voice, and her method of "listening" contrasts well with Kael. However, her decision to stay ("become part of it") lacks visible on-page struggle or agonizing cost; she accepts it too serenely, making the internal conflict feel muted. The "carefully resourceful" trait is well-dramatized through her refusal of weapons.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal duality is well-established, and her motivation to reclaim a lost self drives the narrative. However, the "chimera" nature is resolved somewhat easily with a philosophical mantra ("I am both") rather than a visceral struggle or costly trade-off dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist exhibits "competence porn" traits—perfectly suited for the task with no internal friction, doubt, or cost. Her "warmly methodical" nature is stated rather than tested, resulting in a flat emotional arc where success is inevitable and "warmth" feels like a label rather than a hard-won stance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ripple-mark is a distinct and competent protagonist, but she remains statically capable throughout the narrative. While her backstory implies struggle ("forged by pressure"), the actual scene lacks a moment of doubt, failure, or difficult trade-off that tests this resilience on the page. She solves the crisis with a proficiency that reduces the potential for character dynamism or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.5)
    The custodian is a coherent focalizer with a clear philosophical motivation, but her internal landscape feels largely static. The emotion ("wept") relies on stated sentimentality rather than pressure-cooked reaction, and her "blessing" functions more as a resume item than a source of embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.3)
    The character's interiority is flattened by recycled sentence stems ("not X, but Y") that reduce her thoughts to a formula. She lacks genuine contradictory impulses or high-stakes agency, serving as a passive vessel for the concept rather than a protagonist making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is a distinct, competent focalizer whose professional history colors her perception effectively ("chemical ratios," "slow-burning fuses"). However, her journey is more a ritual enactment than a dramatic struggle; she faces no internal contradiction or moment of doubt, making the "audacity of joy" feel more like a stated trait than an earned emotional victory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is consistent and clearly articulated, driving her choice to remain in the "liminal." However, the heavy reliance on rhetorical comparisons creates emotional distance, making her feel more like a thematic vessel than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal longing is lyrical but abstract ("flavors of silences"), distancing the reader from the visceral reality of the bunker. The decision to leave feels inevitable rather than conflicted; the child feels "invitation" rather than the friction of leaving their only known parent and safety.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    The operator functions as a passive observer and catalyst rather than an active protagonist making difficult choices; his actions (leaning, breathing) are routine. The passenger is a generic archetype of grief without specific interiority, serving primarily as a prop for the setting's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype serving the plot rather than a realized individual. Her interiority relies on summarized realizations ("she understood then") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The phrase "moved wisely adventurous" reads as a forced label rather than a demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist serves as a vessel for abstract metaphors rather than a distinct character with specific interiority. Motivation is declared via diagnostic labels ("mission... to teach suffocating to breathe") rather than embodied in struggle, and she overcomes obstacles with performative ease ("She did not flinch"), lacking genuine human risk or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is consistent and her backstory informs her perspective, but the &quot;virtuously mischievous&quot; trait acts as a told label rather than a driver of specific, clever action. Her internal state transitions smoothly from cynicism to acceptance without a dramatized moment of distinct, character-specific struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for the plot twist rather than a fully realized character. The emotional pivot from "dynasty ender" to "restoration" occurs instantly upon hearing the recording, lacking the internal struggle or hesitation required to make such a profound identity shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, defined by abstract labels ("withdrawn," "allegiance") rather than embodied emotion or specific internal conflict. His motivation is purely metaphysical ("capture the shape of possibility"), lacking the grounded, personal stakes required to make the ritual feel urgent or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist has a clear role and internal state, but her "heartbreak" remains an abstract label ("folded neatly between folders") rather than a felt reality. Her emotions are performed through stock gestures ("trembling fingers," "breath catching") rather than specific, embodied reactions. The shift in her worldview is linear and lacks the friction of genuine internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira functions more as a competent archetype than a complex character; her "underestimated" nature is asserted rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. She displays no internal contradiction or doubt, breezing through the heist without a moment where her "carefully resourceful" trait is tested against genuine failure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions as a competent archetypal vessel for the fable, motivated by a clear duty. However, his interiority relies on high-level abstractions ("trusting the reed to translate grief into grace") rather than specific, messy human friction. The grandmother's lullaby provides a necessary anchor, but the character remains somewhat distant, operating more as a mythic function than a person making hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elira is a clearly motivated archetype, but her journey lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. Her emotional reaction ("mossy delight") feels performed rather than embodied, and she faces no genuine character-testing choices that reveal depth beyond reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is consistent and distinct, fitting the fable-like tone well. However, his internal transformation—from obsessing over order to embracing chaos—feels somewhat rapid and unearned, hinging on reading a journal entry rather than a high-pressure dramatized struggle. The emotional shift reads more as a philosophical pivot than a deeply felt human change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and the arc of redemption is complete, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic abstraction ("guilt calcified," "architecture of her soul") rather than embodied emotion. The character's realization feels filtered through a therapeutic lens rather than visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype with clear motivation, but she lacks internal friction or genuine flaws. While her specific definition of "modest fearlessness" is stated, the story dramatizes a ritual execution rather than a struggle against doubt or limitation, resulting in a character who feels more like a function than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than as a living, breathing character; the heavy use of diagnostic label-speak ("trauma... is also a method of remembering") creates emotional distance. While the internal struggle is clear, the "micro-choices" feel like rhetorical pivots rather than embodied decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist functions as a capable operator but lacks internal contradiction; the "cost" of the memory feels transactional rather than a felt loss that complicates the ending. Emotions are conveyed through elaborate metaphor ("salt of tears," "rope burns") rather than embodied reaction, making the character feel like a cipher for the concept. The lack of hesitation or genuine struggle renders the arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent, and his motivation (witnessing) is clear. However, he lacks internal conflict or flaws; his interaction with the ghost is smooth and safe, resulting in a character who feels slightly idealized rather than tested by the pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist is a capable agent of chaos, and her actions drive the plot efficiently. However, the emotional core—the specific memory of her mother—appears suddenly at the climax without prior grounding, reading as a late attempt to inject personal stakes into a largely philosophical quest.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape—a revolutionary turned poet by the erosion of purpose—is compelling and rendered with specificity. However, the arrival of Dr. Voss renders his arc somewhat passive; she provides the external validation and technological proof that resolves his internal doubt too easily, mitigating the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's guilt is compellingly dramatized through the stone's reaction, anchoring the magical logic in character interiority. The shift from trembling concealment to the honest singing of the lullaby provides a clear, earned character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elira is vivid but defined primarily by labels ("sensibly eccentric") rather than dramatized traits that constrain choices under pressure. Her decision to abandon the surface world is a massive psychological shift that feels rushed and unearned by the brief, frictionless descent. The "cost" of leaving is dismissed too easily, making the character feel more like a vehicle for the setting than a conflicted agent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a fully realized character; her conflict ("pressure to monetize") is stated in summary but never dramatized as a live option in the scene. Her "perpetually learning" attribute appears as a label rather than an error-correction cycle, and she faces no genuine internal resistance when choosing to create the art.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype of the "sensitive artist" rather than a specific individual; her interiority relies on poetic abstractions ("felt in her marrow") rather than contradictory impulses or psychological specificity. Her motivation ("gnawing need") is declared but lacks on-page friction or consequence for failure; she moves through the plot without facing a genuine dilemma or character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined by role and archetype ("solemn civil-rights archivist") rather than specific, dramatized personality. Her internal shifts are summarized as realizations ("That’s when she understood," "She knew then") rather than experienced through embodied micro-choices in a pressure beat. The lack of scenic interiority keeps her motivation stated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is a distinct but static archetype who functions more as a vehicle for philosophy than a living character. He lacks internal contradiction or active struggle in the present moment, resulting in a smooth but emotionally flat arc.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira is a distinct presence, and her internal state is rendered with clarity. However, the pivotal shift from archiver to "awakener" feels frictionless; she accepts the accidental prophecy immediately without doubt or struggle, making the transformation feel more procedural than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype with clear motivation, but her internal state relies on diagnostic labels ("furiously tranquil," "vibrating at the frequency") rather than embodied contradiction. The absence of hesitation or struggle makes her emotional arc feel like a smooth procession rather than a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is competent and distinct, fitting the fable-like tone. However, she lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her expertise is absolute, and the emotional journey is a linear confirmation of her skills rather than a crucible of doubt or change.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is clearly defined but largely static; he functions more as a vessel for the theme than an agent of drama. His primary action is observation, and his motivation ("finding strength in vulnerability") is stated via exposition rather than tested through difficult choice or conflict. The "choice" to leave the Archive is backstory, leaving the present timeline devoid of active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the story's theme than a living character with internal friction. While her "mute eloquence" is consistent, she lacks the contradictory impulses required for depth; her adherence to the covenant feels absolute and static rather than struggled for. The prompt's required attribute "astonished" appears as a label but is immediately contradicted by her "tranquil" and "unblinking" demeanor, creating a characterization disconnect.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vey is distinct but lacks sufficient agency and internal friction in the present scene; the "heartbeat" constraint is descriptive rather than a driver of difficult choices. The interaction with Lira is frictionless, lacking the status dynamics or conflicting goals that create a "crucible" for character revelation. Vey's primary action—listing items—is backstory/setup, leaving the climax largely reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elira functions more as an archetype (the wise, healing sage) than a fully realized protagonist. She lacks internal "contradictory impulses" or distinct flaws; her motivation is static and virtuous ("to discover beauty"), leading to a lack of genuine struggle or cost in her choices. She serves the theme rather than driving a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is consistent but static, presented as an idealized sage with no internal conflict or flaws. The "brazen calm" removes the struggle necessary for deep characterization, resulting in a figure who illustrates a theme rather than navigating a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between skepticism and longing is well-dramatized, and the shift from "equations" to "convergence" is earned through the on-page experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Coachman is a compelling archetype with a distinct voice and purpose, but his journey is procedural rather than dramatic. He faces a task rather than a crucible; the lack of difficult micro-choices or internal struggle limits character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "translate distance into closeness") rather than embodied animal perception. The protagonist functions as a magical device rather than a living creature, using tools (magnifying glass) and speaking in philosophical riddles without established fable logic. The sudden onset of complex abstract motivation reads as emotional ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic self-analysis ("confusion had become her compass") rather than embodied struggle. The "blessed pariah" identity is asserted through exposition rather than dramatized choice, making the character feel like a thematic vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elric functions as a fairytale archetype rather than a realized character; he lacks internal contradiction, distinct voice, or a flaw that complicates his success. His motivation is delivered via abstract exposition ("driven... by the sacredly playful urge") rather than dramatized desire, and his emotional state remains static ("reverence," "joy") without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's transition from crisis actor to historian provides a strong conceptual anchor, but the emotional arc feels more philosophical than visceral. The character functions largely as a thematic vessel until the final confrontation, lacking sufficient friction or difficult micro-choices in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation (seeking home) and internal conflict (pain of memory vs. need for truth) are clear and drive the ritual. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("geometry of belonging," "fractured soul") rather than specific, embodied emotion. The "not X, but Y" syntactic tic filters the character's experience through a repetitive rhetorical device, distancing the reader from her raw state.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's internal arc is linear and lacks resistance; she moves from guilt to resolution without facing a contradictory impulse or a costly choice on the page. The transition feels inevitable rather than earned, as the "winnowing" process abstractly resolves her trauma without dramatizing the difficulty of self-forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a clear internal philosophy and consistent voice. However, the "mischievous" trait is largely established through backstory summary rather than dramatized action in the present, and her motivation remains somewhat cerebral and abstract ("devotion to complexity") until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("weight of kintsugi intentions") and diagnostic summaries of past trauma rather than embodied, momentary emotion. The protagonist feels more like a thematic vessel than a living person, with interiority that lectures on the concept rather than revealing distinct psychology under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the narrative; the painter’s struggle with reality is embodied well in the inciting incident. However, the attribute "intimately aloof" is applied awkwardly to footsteps rather than character interaction, and the internal resolution feels slightly rushed given the depth of the initial crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; her motivation (the vow) is stated rather than dramatized through struggle. The emotional "weight" is described via metaphor ("carved into her ribs") but lacks an on-page cost or difficult choice to validate it. She faces no internal resistance to using the cork, making her agency feel automatic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character is defined primarily by habit and backstory ("tried to ignore it once," "joints stiffen") rather than by immediate, high-stakes choices in a specific scene. Internal state is summarized ("she mourns the silence") rather than dramatized through a conflict that forces a deviation from her routine. The "patchwork" nature is a label that doesn't clearly inform her physical actions or decisions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's "involuntarily truthful" trait feels asserted rather than organically dramatized, relying on blunt dialogue and exposition ("truth became a liability") to establish the constraint. The final decision to abandon the eye—her essential survival tool—contradicts the scene's immediate evidence (where the eye successfully provided safety) and relies on diagnostic label-speak ("cultivate psychological safety") rather than earned internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Silas is a consistent focalizer with a unique worldview ("borrowed memory") that effectively drives the narrative. His motivation is distinct from simple grief, leading to a character-specific choice at the end, though his "eccentricity" is established more through exposition than interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is a functional archetype of the lonely scholar, but he lacks internal contradiction or struggle; he simply accepts the magical call without doubt. The attribute "empirically intuitive" serves as a told label rather than a demonstrated trait that complicates his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's motivation is established, but the climax relies on an external figure diagnosing her flaw ("You chose power over pulse") rather than her demonstrating it through action or realization. This reduces agency at the pivotal moment. The shift from commanding to humble is told rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is a thematic vessel rather than a person; she receives a devastating confession (betrayal regarding her life's work) with immediate, unconflicted acceptance. Emotional processing is bypassed for magical resolution, lacking the "internal contradiction" or "struggle" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrator suffers from diagnostic self-awareness, analyzing their own condition with therapy-speak labels (“feral nostalgia,” “chronologically confused,” “habit as corrosive as it is predictable”) rather than simply embodying the crisis. While the internal conflict is clear, this meta-commentary creates distance, making the character feel like they are performing their angst rather than living it. The interaction with the younger self is vivid, but the emotional logic is explained rather than shown through behavior alone.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s internal struggle with her disability is poignant, but her pivotal realization is largely delivered by Master Ren’s monologue rather than earned through her own active struggle in the scene. While the emotional arc is clear, the protagonist is somewhat passive, receiving wisdom rather than forging it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elira’s internal conflict between scholarly rigor and intuitive superstition is well-dramatized through the ink mechanic. The physical embodiment of her anxiety (trembling, scars) grounds the emotion effectively. However, the ending relies on a summarized epiphany ("stories... alchemize it") rather than letting the transformed scars speak for themselves, which slightly flattens the character's final moment into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—balancing her "gift" for metaphor against the need for naked truth—is dramatized effectively. Her regret is embodied in physical details (trembling hands, damp boots), avoiding melodrama. The relationship dynamic shifts credibly from estrangement to tentative resonance through shared action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a ritual implement than a character; she lacks internal conflict or distinct personality beyond the archetype. Her surrender to the library’s demands is immediate and frictionless ("None resisted. None needed to"), which flattens the dramatic arc. Motivation is stated ("housekeeping") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a clear, idiosyncratic worldview and specific internal logic (counting seven breaths). However, he functions more as a static vessel for the concept than a character undergoing struggle; the lack of internal contradiction or difficult choice lowers the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is distinct and interiority is rich, grounding the "physics of letting go" in specific grief. However, the protagonist enters the scene with the decision already made; the beat is an execution of a ritual rather than a struggle between live options, which lowers the immediate dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is clearly defined, but her motivation ("widen perspectives") remains abstract and intellectual, lacking visceral urgency until the final interaction with the father. The "probability professor" background feels like a convenient thematic wrapper, and her internal state is often conveyed through labels ("theoretically rebellious") rather than dramatized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The operator functions effectively as a mythological archetype—a ferryman of voices—but her internal life feels somewhat subordinated to the story's high concept. The climax, where she surrenders to the "self" call, is stylistically fitting but lacks a dramatized psychological struggle or hesitation, making the final cost feel inevitable rather than actively chosen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks active agency or internal conflict; she functions primarily as a passive observer and transcriber of theme. Motivation is stated ("simple, sacred") rather than dramatized through struggle or trade-offs. There are no micro-choices under pressure, as the character faces no opposition or difficult decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character is defined by labels ("desperately jocular," "accidental philosopher") that contradict her on-page behavior. She is described as using laughter as currency, yet her actions are uniformly solemn, poetic, and therapist-like; the "jocularity" is stated but never enacted. Her background as a "disaster-relief logistician" colors the efficiency of her setup but feels largely like a costume for a generic wise-mentor figure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a complex individual; she navigates the forest without genuine struggle ("She did not flinch"), which robs the narrative of tension. Emotional states are labeled ("nostalgia," "regret") rather than embodied, resulting in a character who feels like a vessel for the concept rather than a human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as an abstract vessel for a philosophical concept rather than a character under genuine pressure. Motivation and traits are declared via exposition ("Her motivation was simple," "confidently uncertain") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on abstract roles rather than human depth; Elara is a thematic vessel without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The mute girl functions as a convenient prop who overcomes a lifetime of barriers instantly to serve the scene's lesson, flattening the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist is more a vessel for thematic assertion than a living character; her "analytical intuition" functions as magical knowing rather than demonstrated competence. The "arsonist" backstory is a compelling hook but remains largely ornamental, disconnected from the immediate tactical choices in the vault. Emotional reactions are explained ("not from grief, but recognition") rather than embodied, and her acceptance of the "savior" role feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's backstory ("girl who signed consent forms") provides grounding, but her emotional arc is frictionless. The pivot from desperation to mastery happens via a sudden internal voice ("Breathe life into it") rather than a hard-won struggle, resulting in a lack of embodied internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena is a competent, distinct focalizer with a clear skillset (reading walks) that integrates well with the setting. However, her journey lacks deep internal friction or contradictory impulses; she moves through the plot with smooth efficiency, never facing a moment of genuine doubt or high personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is stoic and competent but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses on the page. The "memory of the boy" serves as backstory rather than generating active present-tense conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elira is clearly defined as a whimsical agent of change, and her motivation—planting curiosity—is consistent. However, she lacks internal conflict or distinct flaws; her journey is one of linear success without a moment of doubt, significant risk, or personal cost that would deepen the characterization beyond a benevolent archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lira functions as a thematic vessel rather than a grounded protagonist; her interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("grief settles into bone") rather than specific psychological geometry. Agency is surrendered to external magic (the "summons"), and her transformation is instantaneous rather than earned through difficult on-page choices or behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's defining trait—performance as a survival mechanism—is vividly dramatized through the whittling ritual and narrated actions rather than mere exposition. The internal contradiction between the performed compliance and the felt "hollow" drives the narrative effectively, creating a distinct and memorable psychological portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized vessel for the concept rather than a character facing genuine pressure; she possesses total certainty and faces no internal doubt or external resistance. The complete lack of flaws, contradictory impulses, or difficult choices flattens the character arc into a procession rather than a struggle. Because the ban is already lifted, her actions carry no risk, reducing her agency to performance rather than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character perception is excellent; Elias’s tactile and resonant worldview drives the narrative mechanics and grounding. The relationship dynamic shifts cleanly from skepticism to partnership, though Marta’s pivot to "Teach me" feels slightly accelerated for the space. The shared trait of "innocently cunning" effectively bridges their connection.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elira functions as an archetype—the wise healer performing a ritual—rather than a fully realized character. She faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or difficult choices; her actions are competent and aligned from start to finish, leaving no room for the friction or cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic vessel rather than a living character; she lacks internal contradiction or specific, embodied flaws. Her emotional state is conveyed through high-flown abstraction ("scraped her soul to marrow") rather than behavior, and she faces no difficult choices that test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is a distinct observer but lacks internal contradiction or meaningful struggle; her choices are procedural rather than high-stakes. The "steadily curious" motivation is stated in summary rather than dramatized through cost or risk, resulting in a static, archetypal figure who is validated rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is deeply rooted in the daughter's silence, driving the protagonist to endure high stakes. The interiority effectively contrasts the academic setting with visceral grief. However, physical embodiment relies on stock gestures ("nails bit her palms") rather than character-specific idiosyncrasies.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira is a clearly motivated protagonist with a distinct role, and her internal drive to preserve "grit" coheres well. However, her emotional arc relies on summarized labels ("wept... not for loss, but for resilience") rather than embodied reaction, creating a layer of distance at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s internal state is clear, but her thoughts often read like a prepared essay rather than organic processing ("redemption implied erasure"). The realization of the metaphor ("it was a metaphor curled in keratin") feels like authorial insertion rather than character discovery. The emotional arc is legible, but the "perfect" moral resolution lacks the messiness of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira’s interiority is distinct, and the shift from seeking closure to continuation is a coherent arc. However, her agency is dampened by the environment’s eagerness to assist her; she follows instructions from plants and coffee rings rather than forcing outcomes through difficult, high-cost choices. The prompt-mandated telepathy is integrated functionally but acts more as a convenient GPS than a source of character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal mirroring—her own unsent letters—effectively anchors the external quest, creating a cohesive emotional arc. Her final choice to "release" the letters is a clear, motivated action that resolves her internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype without internal contradiction, functioning as a vehicle for the premise rather than a distinct individual. Motivation is declared ("to free trapped creativity") rather than emerging from specific psychological needs, and her emotional reactions (weeping, rapture) feel performed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype ("dreamless guard") rather than a character with specific interiority. While the "shoulders softened" moment hints at a burden, the lack of on-page struggle or difficult choices leaves motivation stated rather than dramatized. The character performs a duty without facing meaningful internal or external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for the concept rather than a living character under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; his journey is a linear progression of successes without doubt, contradictory impulses, or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    The characters function as atmospheric archetypes rather than distinct individuals. There is no internal contradiction or psychological pressure; their motivation is stated as a role ("mission was... pilgrimage") rather than a personal drive, and they face no difficult choices that test their resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is physically grounded in the trembling hands and the missing bolt, creating a strong link between backstory and present action. The choice to break the silence is earned through the pressure of the child's arrival, moving effectively from passive endurance to active risk. A slight disconnect exists between the sci-fi implication of "nerve regeneration" and the gothic fantasy tone, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a mythic archetype rather than a realized individual, lacking specific interiority or genuine internal conflict. The refusal to rule is a standard trope that feels unearned because the emotional cost of the exile is stated in abstract metaphors ("cruel arithmetic") rather than dramatized through behavior or friction in the scene. Her passivity during the central conflict reduces her to an observer rather than an agent of change.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly defined ("gnawing need to discover"), and her internal state of grief is legible. However, her transition from solitary tapping to community teacher in the summary ending feels idealized and lacks a dramatized emotional cost or hesitation. The characterization leans heavily on abstract descriptors ("ecological, emotional, ancestral") rather than embodied reactions to the storm or the dive.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is largely passive; she observes the stones activating rather than forcing a turn through agency. Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("hollow—not defeated, but unmoored") rather than embodied emotion or difficult choice. The realization at the end feels unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype who faces no genuine internal conflict or doubt. Her choices feel pre-ordained by her role rather than struggled for in the scene; she begins and ends with the same unwavering wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is vividly rendered but filtered through diagnostic therapy-speak ("somatic markers," "anchor optimism") that distances the reader from raw experience. The protagonist feels defined by their trauma label rather than emergent behavior, and the emotional arc resolves too neatly through a passive epiphany rather than a conflicted, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a symbolic vehicle for the surreal imagery rather than a fully embodied human; her transition from "crestfallen" to "crestRISEN" feels like a lexical trick rather than an earned emotional arc. While her internal logic is consistent with the dream-logic of the piece, the reliance on abstract assertions of feeling ("grief just gravity") keeps the emotional reality at a distance. The central transformation is passive—she steps onto a tapestry and lets the walls cocoon her—rather than driven by a difficult active choice with visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich, establishing a clear philosophical drive. However, she functions primarily as a vessel for the concept; the emotional transition from observation to the existential leap of the final act feels slightly performative rather than grounded in a deep character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is delivered through direct labeling ("bravely conflicted storm within") rather than dramatized nuance. While the sacrifice is clear, the character operates as an archetype serving the plot's mechanical needs rather than a specific, lived-in persona. The dialogue at the end feels staged and didactic rather than a natural expression of a person facing arrest.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is a distinct, consistent focalizer, though her pacifism reads somewhat idealized. Her interiority is stylized ("memorizing braille," "senselessly perceptive"), which creates a poetic distance rather than intimate psychological access. The trait of being "senselessly perceptive" is told via label rather than dramatized through high-stakes observation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is competent and goal-focused, but the "cool-headed" trait acts as emotional armor, distancing the reader from genuine risk or internal struggle. While her actions are decisive, her lack of visceral reaction to the "world screaming" limits the stakes to the physical/professional realm rather than the personal.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist is highly competent but static; she executes a pre-planned victory without internal hesitation or on-page cost. While motivation is clear, her characterization relies heavily on exposition ("devotedly observant," "cycles she’d spent her life trying to break") rather than dramatized struggle. The "father's letter" provides stakes but feels like a convenient device to explain her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (old guilt) is clearly established and drives the ritualistic climax. However, the pivot to writing a letter to her younger self feels slightly performative and disconnected from the immediate scene pressures, leaning into therapeutic abstraction rather than organic reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is clearly drawn, but key traits like "socially perceptive" function as declared abilities to solve the plot rather than organic facets of personality that create friction. The "whimsical" label feels slightly at odds with the solemnity of the scene, and her internal transition is smooth rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype ("gentle radical") rather than a person, lacking internal contradictions or specific, grounded behavior. The antagonist’s sudden capitulation—crumbling from authoritarian menace to weeping father upon receiving a single tile—is unearned and dissolves the scene’s psychological realism. Motivation is declared in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is consistently drawn with vivid sensory details, but she lacks internal friction or significant flaws. Her journey is smooth—she identifies a need and fulfills it with competence—which lowers the dramatic stakes of her final release. The transition from "refusing to fade" to accepting the "final bow" feels slightly unearned by the on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid, grounding the abstract premise in physical sensation and memory. However, the transition from "skeptic" to believer is largely retrospective; the on-page struggle is less about doubt and more about procedural execution, slightly lowering the dramatic stakes of her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as a sensor rather than a character with internal conflict; her motivation is stated ("existential") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. She faces no significant resistance or moment of doubt, making her a frictionless vehicle for the concept. The emotional experience is described via thermal metaphors rather than embodied human reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a living character; her internal life is conveyed through summary and philosophical assertion rather than contradictory impulses or difficult on-page choices. The lack of specific, dramatized struggle reduces her to a thematic vehicle, with motivation declared ("co-architects of the next moment") rather than earned through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s interiority is detailed, establishing a clear emotional landscape of betrayal and weary resilience. However, her struggle remains largely reflective; the lack of contradictory impulses or active resistance in the moment makes her feel more like a static vessel for the theme than a character under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman functions more as a stoic archetype than a fully realized character, with a tragic backstory (lost wife and son) that feels like generic shorthand. His motivation is abstract and philosophical ("distill complexity"), leading to a static internal state that is confirmed rather than challenged by the narrative events.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from arrival to renunciation. However, the "zen-minded" trait removes internal friction; she acts with near-perfect competence and wisdom, lacking the contradictory impulses or struggle that would heighten the stakes of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.9)
    The protagonist is a vessel for the ritual rather than a character under pressure; her motivation is stated ("instill... resilience") but never tested by conflicting desires or difficult choices. Emotions are described via adjectives ("wistfully pragmatic," "quiet certainty") rather than dramatized through action or internal struggle. There is no felt cost to her actions beyond generic physical fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    Veyra is defined primarily by high-concept labels ("contemporary of extinct species") and abstract internal states rather than dramatized agency. Her motivation is explicitly stated in narration ("translating isolation into independence") rather than revealed through friction or difficult choices. The emotional shift from mourning to genesis feels unearned, relying on a sudden realization rather than a psychological progression under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his transition from human to spirit is instantaneous and frictionless. The "inevitably whimsical" trait functions as a declared label that justifies the plot rather than a flaw or driver of complex choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elira is a highly competent protagonist, but she lacks internal contradiction or a flaw that complicates her success. She enters the crisis prepared and succeeds without a moment of doubt, personal cost, or psychological evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and the claustrophobia provides genuine friction against the setting. However, the resolution—a sudden internal download of "truth"—feels less like an earned character turn and more like a convenient epiphany that bypasses the emotional cost of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elira’s prosopagnosia is well-integrated into her worldview, anchoring her perception in texture. However, her motivation is delivered through abstract summary ("sought to awaken dormant empathy") rather than embodied desire. The antagonist’s psychology—stealing faces to mourn strangers without killing them—strains credibility and reads as symbolic convenience rather than human behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's "nervously confident" trait appears as a told label rather than a behavior enacted through difficult choices under pressure. The emotional arc relies on exposition about the grandfather to generate depth rather than a present-tense struggle that tests her idealism.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak (“unburdened by the weight,” “irreversible choices”) rather than embodied emotion. The motivation is abstract (“sculpt possibility”) and lacks a concrete, on-page test of character beyond a low-stakes micro-choice. The "texture of pixelated amnesty brushing against his ribs" is an abstraction that distances the reader from genuine feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined by summarized history and labeled traits (e.g., "perceptively calm") rather than immediate action. There is no dramatized scene where his character is tested under pressure; his transformation is recounted as backstory rather than shown through a high-stakes on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is functionally motivated but lacks internal conflict or reluctance; she accepts the call and succeeds without genuine struggle or hesitation. Her "quiet redemption" is stated in backstory rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the present scene. The character feels more like a thematic vessel than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as an archetype with a functional internal arc, but the emotional progression feels slightly mechanical, driven by the seed’s agency rather than her active choices during the vision. The specific memories (child, lover, enemy) read as generic snapshots rather than deeply felt, character-specific history.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for the ritual rather than a specific individual. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she moves with absolute certainty ("didn't speak... didn't need to"), making her a passive executor of destiny rather than an agent making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character motivations are legible, but the "reckless" trait is asserted rather than dramatized; Elira acts with deliberate patience, not recklessness. Kael’s transformation from "spite" to "seedling" is unearned by the brief interaction; he capitulates to a speech and a physical restraint rather than a genuine psychological turn.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Jasper is a vividly drawn character with a distinct, professionally informed worldview (calibration, insulation). His internal contradiction—craving connection while hiding in facts—is strong, though the shift from insulation to "Project Echo" feels slightly rushed for a single scene, lacking a moment of visible struggle before the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elira is defined by competency rather than struggle; her "kindly methodical" nature makes the central challenge effortless, removing potential internal conflict. The backstory of "buried dissertations" suggests depth, but in the scene, she faces no temptation to grasp or rush, making her victory feel inevitable rather than earned through character testing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for the prompt's ritual rather than a living character with agency. Internal conflict is stated ("question whether she cataloged truths or merely beautiful lies") but instantly resolved by the magic system without a difficult on-page choice or demonstrated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a fully realized character; her motivation ("to dissolve the walls between hearts") is abstract and messianic. While the backstory attempts to ground her, the lack of hesitation or contradictory impulses during the ritual makes her journey feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but she reads more as a collection of poetic traits ("river chronicler," "daringly methodical") than a person making hard choices under pressure. The pivotal backstory of the sister is summarized rather than dramatized, which distances the reader from the guilt driving the narrative. While the internal state is vivid, the lack of contradictory impulses reduces the complexity of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions effectively as an archetypal seeker but lacks specific, contradictory interiority. Emotional states are often labeled directly (e.g., "cautious exuberance") rather than demonstrated through complex reaction or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s motivation is clearly stated, and her internal state (trembling) adds texture, but her victory feels preordained rather than earned through struggle. The conflict remains largely internal and philosophical; the antagonist is a passive prop who offers no resistance, reducing the need for Elira to make a difficult, high-cost choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is highly competent and motivationally clear, but she functions more as an archetypal vehicle for the ritual than a dynamic character with internal friction. There are no contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure; her actions enact a predetermined procedure without emotional risk or deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and direct labeling ("committed caretaker," "kindly decisive part of her") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist’s internal state is explained to the reader ("she mended them with broth... never judging") rather than revealed through struggle or contradiction in the moment. Motivation is stated as an abstract goal ("sought something deeper than healing") without immediate, embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elira's internal conflict is clear, but the emotional progression relies on diagnostic labels ("protected vulnerability") rather than embodied experience at the peak. The prompt's profession is well-integrated as a source of tension, though the resolution feels slightly driven by external prompts (the chimes) rather than purely internal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elira’s backward-aging condition is muddled by contradictory descriptions; she has "seventy-year-old hands" and "old bones" despite her "body growing younger" and "skin smoothing." This logical inconsistency undermines her characterization as a speculative entity. Kael serves largely as a passive prop for the lesson, lacking distinct agency or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype rather than a character with agency; it executes a pre-programmed duty without internal conflict or struggle. There are no "micro-choices in difficult moments" as required; the skimmer merely observes and exists, lacking the contradictory impulses or emotional friction needed to drive a literary narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lior's internal conflict (artist vs. technician) is clear and grounded, but his pivotal epiphany is delivered externally by the light-figure rather than realized through struggle. The dialogue "That's why you're here" reduces his agency in the climax, turning him into a recipient of wisdom rather than an active discoverer.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the revelation that his name was signed decades ago shifts the narrative from agency to destiny, rendering him a passive observer of his own fate. He encounters no genuine internal resistance, diving "without hesitation," which flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal state is richly detailed, but her pivotal transformation relies on an "unbidden" external vision rather than active struggle. This lack of agency in the climax makes the shift from surrender to leadership feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal transition from grief to purpose is legible, though the emotional arc relies heavily on high-concept metaphors ("clung to his ribs like frost") rather than grounded interiority. While the motivation to transform fear into memory is compelling, the lack of resistance to his ritual—he sings and it simply works—lowers the felt cost of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is distinct, with the "lukewarm" trait providing a consistent filter for his actions, but he functions more as a procedural device than a character under pressure. He faces no internal doubts or difficult choices; his competence is absolute, which flattens the dramatic arc into a linear execution of a task. The lack of struggle or significant personal cost makes him feel somewhat static despite the vivid characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear internal pivot from erasure to preservation. However, the shift occurs with minimal on-page struggle or doubt, making the transformation feel smoother than a high-stakes crisis warrants. The lack of visible emotional cost or hesitation before defying the state dampens the impact of his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for the theme rather than a distinct individual. Her motivation ("harmonize logic and intuition") is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her emotional progression moves smoothly from intent to success without the friction of genuine internal conflict. The trait of being "secretly sentimental" is established via a list of props (pressed petals, a tear) rather than behavior that complicates the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist acts as a competent vessel for the story's theme rather than a character under immediate pressure; her motivation is delivered via exposition ("Her motivation was not glory...") rather than dramatized decision-making. She faces no internal contradiction or genuine risk of failure, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is consistent, but his struggle is intellectualized rather than felt. The emotional arc relies on diagnostic labels ("ego death," "numbness") and abstract assertions of change ("warmth return... love without claim") rather than dramatized vulnerability. The secondary characters (Lira, Torvin) function as disembodied thematic mouthpieces rather than genuine sources of interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies on static labels ("notably receptive," "porous") and summary rather than choices made under immediate scene pressure. Aris functions as a vessel for the concept without internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in a dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by a single emotional label (grief) and a static ritual. His interiority relies on abstract summaries ("tends to the unspoken") rather than specific, contradictory thoughts or impulses. There is no active struggle or meaningful micro-choice on the page; he simply performs the established ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The guardian’s motivation—dimensional homesickness—is deeply felt and drives the narrative arc from isolation to connection effectively. The transition from "feral" to gentle companion is slightly rapid, but the internal logic of seeking "warm ink" and connection grounds the shift. The character's internal landscape is vivid and successfully mirrors the external setting.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elric’s motivation is clear and his persistence is admirable, but his interiority is filtered through a repetitive stylistic device (“not X, but Y”) that renders his emotional state rhetorical rather than embodied. The transition from "hopeless" to "becoming the road" is intellectually asserted rather than deeply felt through specific micro-reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is poetic and clear, anchoring the narrative effectively. However, she lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses in the scene; her journey is linear, and the central struggle is resolved through a smooth internal shift rather than a difficult choice with visible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; "resiliently positive" acts as a label rather than a tested trait under pressure. There is no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his motivation is purely altruistic and his competence is absolute, lacking the friction of doubt or error required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype ("The Architect") rather than a fully realized character. Her motivation is abstract and philosophical ("texture of connection") rather than visceral, and she lacks embodied emotional reactions to the surreal threats, maintaining a static "unsettling calm."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elira functions as a static mentor figure rather than a protagonist under pressure; she encounters no internal resistance or flaws, and her competence is never genuinely tested by the low-stakes scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions as a competent professional but lacks internal conflict or a distinctive personality beyond her role. Her trait of being "persistently curious" is stated in exposition rather than demonstrated through unique choices that complicate the plot. She faces no significant personal cost or difficult trade-off, acting more as a plot device than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is a competent vessel for the plot but lacks deep internal friction; her claustrophobia is stated as a "live wire" yet overcome without distinct tactical cost or impact on choices. Her motivation is noble but static, lacking the contradictory impulses or selfish desires that generate complex agency under pressure. The emotional payoff feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aris is atmospheric but his motivation ("retrieval of wisdom") feels abstract and told rather than dramatized through urgent need. The heartbeat counting serves as a functional anchor but reads more like an assigned trait than a compulsion driving choice under pressure. His interiority is consistent, but his agency is limited to performing a ritual that functions perfectly on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist is defined by competence and physical traits rather than difficult choices; she performs a pre-mastered ritual without active internal struggle or risk of failure. The climax relies on abstract emotional labels ("longing," "regret") rather than embodied reaction, creating a diagnostic distance from the character's felt experience during the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s internal struggle is vivid but resolves too cleanly through magical intervention rather than a difficult choice. The transition from "bitterness" to "gravitational giggles" feels unearned by immediate action or sacrifice, relying on diagnostic interiority ("transmuted into...") rather than dramatized behavioral change under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal healer rather than a nuanced character with internal conflict. Her success is linear and inevitable, with the only cost being physical ("fingers blistered") rather than a difficult choice or renunciation. Motivation is clear but lacks the friction of competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as a "respectfully rebellious" mailman, but this trait is delivered primarily through expository summary and backstory reputation rather than dramatized choice in the present scene. His internal life leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("stitching together absences") rather than grounded psychological texture. The motivation is clear (Lena's promise), but the emotional stakes feel performed for the reader rather than viscerally felt by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or struggle; he functions as a passive vessel for the theme rather than a character making difficult choices. His motivation is abstract philosophy stated by the narrator ("interpret silence as possibility") rather than a driver of action with visible, felt costs.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent, with a clear goal driven by backstory. However, her journey lacks internal contradiction or a difficult choice; the realization at the climax is an epiphany rather than a hard-won shift requiring sacrifice, resulting in a functional but friction-free arc.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The librarian’s obsession is clear and drives the narrative, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("hue of hope," "amber of yearning") rather than embodied experience. While the "indigo of surrender" implies a character arc, it functions more as a magical ingredient than a dramatized psychological shift in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is an archetype of perfect competence who faces no internal contradiction or genuine struggle. He "did not flinch," robbing the narrative of human vulnerability, and his victory comes without visible cost or renunciation, relying instead on a painless symbolic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's drive is legible, but the "chronically curious" trait functions more as a label than a dramatized behavior until the final beat. The pivot from surgical recovery to fatalistic submission ("let the orchard take the rest") feels steep; while the "vacancy" motivates it, the psychological leap to self-annihilation leans heavily on the stated trait rather than emotional inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—tenderness masked as combat—are dramatized with precision, creating a compelling internal conflict. Her motivation to mentor through "grit" drives choices that carry visible emotional cost, though the score is capped by line-level monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized archetype without internal contradiction or flaws. Her motivation is abstract and declared ("could not bear a world without that shimmer") rather than dramatized through personal cost or difficult choices. She faces no resistance and succeeds via a purely positive ritual, resulting in a lack of psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is a competent, stoic archetype ("She didn't flinch") who functions as an expert operator rather than a character with internal conflict. Her motivation ("balance") is abstract and professional, lacking the personal stakes or contradictory impulses required for higher emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly established in backstory ("visceral"), but she faces no on-page resistance or contradictory impulses. Her competence is absolute, leading to a linear path without the "crucible" of choice or failure required for higher bands. The emotional climax feels performed rather than earned through struggle or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is legible, but the pivot to the sister’s grief emerges late as a mid-story patch rather than an integrated drive from the start. The "analytic" trait is performed through metaphorical internal monologue ("dissected grief like equations") rather than specific, grounded behavior, distancing the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist functions as a collection of poetic attributes ("ink-stained," "seldom-heard") rather than a realized character with contradictory impulses. Motivation is asserted via label-only interiority ("unspoken needs") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance, resulting in a static emotional trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a passive observer rather than an agent of change; she is "summoned by instinct" and led by the environment. Her internal state is described through lyric abstraction rather than embodied emotion or hard choices, and the "affectionate detachment" feels like a labeled posture rather than an earned reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is deeply realized, with grief functioning not just as an emotion but as a lens for interpreting the world. Her motivation—to find shape in absence—drives the central action and coheres with the "quietly explosive" trait. The emotional logic is embodied in the physical ritual of the telescope, grounding abstract feelings in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Internal motivation is visceral and distinct, grounding the artistic impulse in tactile necessity rather than cliché. The character's face blindness is handled well as a sensory experience, though the midway epiphany ("believing her face blindness was a deficit") feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized through a resistance-and-breakthrough beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.6)
    Arlen is a functional archetype of the "competent apprentice" but lacks internal contradiction or genuine blind spots. His journey is linear and frictionless; he observes, understands, and succeeds without facing a dilemma that tests his values. The "trembling hands" before the Captain suggest stakes that the narrative fails to dramatize, as his success is immediate and unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, and the internal arc moves from seeking control to accepting reharmonization. However, the emotional epiphany feels more like a passive reception of wisdom ("the rhythm poured into her") than a hard-won psychological struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elira acts as a benevolent orchestrator without internal conflict or cost, functioning more as a plot device than a character under pressure. The settlers' skepticism is introduced and immediately resolved by her "strangely trustworthy" aura, removing the friction necessary for genuine relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a poetic device than a fully realized character. Interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("tears crystallized... into tuning forks") rather than embodied emotion or genuine psychological struggle. The lack of hesitation or conflicting desires regarding the end of existence flattens the dramatic agency.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s "arithmetic" motivation and "resignation" create a distinct, compelling interiority that eschews standard heroism. The internal conflict is dramatized through action rather than summary, though the traveler functions more as a catalyst than a fully fleshed counter-force.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s scientific interiority is distinct and well-sustained, filtering grief through specific professional concepts. However, the daughter’s "symphonic mind" feels retroactively applied to serve the ending's metaphor rather than an organic, observed trait, making the resolution feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by her role and backstory ("daughter, debtor, deserter"), fitting the fable-like mode. However, her internal landscape is largely static; the "unwriting" motivation serves as a premise rather than a source of active, agonizing struggle in the scene. The interaction with patrons feels rehearsed rather than pressurized, lacking the visceral contradictory impulses that drive high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elira's internal experience is vivid, but the "chef" persona feels partitioned from the climax, where she acts more as a surgeon/mage; the cooking motivation reappears only in the denouement. Her victory over the remorse relies on stated willpower ("she did not flinch") rather than a character-specific choice or tactical pivot, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is a competent protagonist who faces no internal contradiction or genuine risk; her "empathetically decisive" nature is stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. The emotional arc is smooth and therapeutic, lacking the grit or cost of a character tested by failure or significant loss.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("helix-minded," "archeologist") rather than behavior under pressure. Emotional processing is summarized via metaphor ("sugar in black coffee") rather than dramatized, leaving the internal struggle abstract and lacking visceral grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elira is a competent focalizer, but her "fractured cognition" functions more as a stated superpower than a constraint or source of internal conflict. Her choices are linear and purely tactical; the "cost" of searing memory reads as an expositional reward rather than a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.6)
    Silas functions as a mythic archetype rather than a grounded character; he lacks contradictory impulses, internal conflict, or a blind spot that complicates his success. His journey is procedural—he identifies a problem and fixes it without facing a difficult choice or paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined by labels and backstory summary rather than on-page action or contradictory impulses. The central realization is an abstract epiphany ("Beauty... wasn't in flawless victory") rather than a decision forced by immediate pressure. Emotional shifts are described ("spirit lighter") but not dramatized through distinct behavioral changes or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer with specific traits, and her pacifism actively shapes her problem-solving method. However, her interiority relies heavily on stylized metaphor ("silence of grief... thick as tar") rather than grounded psychological struggle, and her choices face external resistance rather than deep internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elira functions as a static "wise woman" archetype without internal contradiction or genuine flaws; she begins and ends the story in a state of superior understanding. Her primary mode is observation rather than decision-making under pressure, and she faces no significant character test that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative, particularly the choice to fly deeper into danger rather than flee the returning gravity. The internal shift from pilot to "echo" is well-staged via the interaction with the relic, though the epiphany feels slightly more thematic than character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is professional and clear, but interiority relies on diagnostic summary ("cultivate foresight") rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional anchor relies on a specific cliché ("weighed more than it should"), which flattens the character's grief into a trope rather than a felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic vessel rather than a character with conflicting desires; interiority is abstract and devoid of the doubt or struggle required to humanize the archetype. Motivation is stated as a high-concept manifesto ("certify wonder") rather than derived from grounded emotional need.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to "harvest insights" is clear, but her interiority feels clinical and lacks the contradictory impulses required for higher bands; the struggle against the temptation to fix the weave is stated rather than felt. The coda ("Years later...") flattens the character into a sage figure rather than a person living a specific moment of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her internal landscape is described through abstract metaphors ("seams split open," "erosion") rather than dramatized struggle. While her motivation is stated ("hunger... to map the unmappable"), it lacks on-page friction; she borrows personalities like costumes without visible psychological cost or conflicting desires in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to germinate awe") is clear but abstract, driving the story thematically rather than viscerally. The "jittery" trait adds texture but doesn't genuinely complicate her choices; she overcomes her anxiety instantly to teach the child, making the internal struggle feel slight.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her motivation ("proof") is stated rather than felt through conflicting desires. While the decision not to publish shows agency, the internal landscape relies on "told" traits (e.g., "grounded in both science and spirit") rather than dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and the final sacrifice offers a decisive, high-cost choice that lands with emotional weight. However, her interiority is largely defined by "wistful" longing and atmospheric observation rather than complex, embodied contradictions; she feels more like an archetype than a living psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Arlo is consistently drawn as a mythic archetype, but he lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. The trait "meek" is asserted by the narrator ("He wasn’t loud...") rather than dramatized through social pressure or difficulty; his competence is absolute, reducing the sense of genuine struggle or vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira possesses a distinct, sensory-driven interiority that grounds the fantastical elements, but her role is largely passive; she witnesses the truth rather than forcing its revelation against resistance. The emotional conclusion feels intellectually summarized ("unbearable lightness") rather than embodied in a decisive new behavior or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character motivation is deeply rooted in grief and service, creating a compelling internal landscape. Elias's reticence and ritualistic behavior are consistent and well-dramatized. The shift from "hollowing" to "luminescent" feels earned by his character arc, even if the external trigger is slight.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist functions as a distinct archetype with clear motivation ("shape a new dawn"), but remains static; she acts out a routine rather than confronting a specific high-pressure choice or internal contradiction in this scene. Her struggle is stated ("quiet, stubborn will") rather than dramatized through a dilemma that tests her resolve with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract philosophical queries rather than distinct personality traits or contradictory behavior. Her motivation ("to understand") remains cerebral, and the shift to "cultivating fractures" reads as an intellectual calculation rather than a visceral, costly emotional turn earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as a maintenance worker with a distinct "arboreal" motivation, but she lacks internal conflict or struggle. Her journey is frictionless; she faces no genuine dilemma or emotional resistance, accepting her transformation into a "pilgrim" without a sense of cost or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist serves as a functional archetype rather than a complex agent; her "scattered" memory is stated but never dramatized as a genuine obstacle, as she accesses the critical song immediately without struggle or internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's journey relies heavily on diagnostic self-awareness ("saw her sensitivity not as weakness, but as a lens") rather than dramatized struggle. The epiphany feels intellectual and label-heavy ("soil of self-acceptance") rather than earned through a high-pressure choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is an archetypal figure who functions effectively as a vessel for the prompt's themes. While her motivation to find the sacred is clear, her internal landscape is depicted through broad, summarizing metaphors ("loss becomes wallpaper") rather than specific, contradictory psychological pressure. The "uncloaking" offers a moment of agency, but the character remains more symbolic than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elira is a competent, focused protagonist whose motivation ("existential") is clearly stated but feels abstract rather than visceral. While her professional dedication is well-rendered, she lacks internal contradiction or personal stakes that would force a difficult choice; her emotional peak ("tears froze") feels slightly performative given the lack of specific personal connection to the vows.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by heritage and immediate goal, showing agency. However, the antagonists feel thin; The Chain's immediate, terrified flight from a watch fob reads as melodramatic and lacks sufficient on-page motivation, reducing him to a prop.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is labeled a "skeptic," yet she accepts the magical premises (compass rings, forest elections, tasting direction) with the immediate faith of a mystic. This creates a "show vs. tell" dissonance where the declared trait ("relentless doubt") never generates resistance or friction against the plot. Her internal arc—moving from doubt to trust—feels unearned because the doubt was never dramatized as a genuine obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions more as an allegorical vessel than a grounded character; traits like "charcoal-fingered" feel like labels rather than lived reality. The emotional arc is summarized in backstory ("spent years corked") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice under pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's "wilting" trait is brilliantly integrated, functioning not just as a quirk but as a physical constraint that dictates her movement and pacing through the setting. Her motivation is clear and relentless, though her internal landscape is somewhat linear—she is a martyr for truth without significant internal contradiction or temptation to abandon the quest. The shift in identity at the end ("become the archive") is a strong character beat earned by the action.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic abstraction rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "seasonal muteness" and motivation are presented as static labels in a summary, rather than constraints that force difficult, high-stakes tactics in a specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict (preservation vs. transformation) is compelling, but the memories and fears remain generic abstractions ("closet monsters," "lullabies") rather than specific, lived details. The emotional arc succeeds, but the lack of granular, idiosyncratic history limits the depth of the character's nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara functions more as a magical device than a person; she lacks internal conflict, flaws, or contradictory impulses. Leo’s grief is a standard archetype, and his rapid transition from "hollow" to "laughing" in one afternoon relies on summary rather than dramatized emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic cipher rather than a person, lacking internal conflict or flaws; she executes her mission with frictionless perfection. Motivation is delivered via diagnostic label-speak ("to encrypt vulnerability as strength") rather than embodied desire or struggle, keeping the characterization abstract and distant.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elira is a competent, proactive protagonist, and her "cataloging" response to anomalies establishes a distinct worldview. However, the emotional arc resolves too smoothly; the reunion lacks the friction or embodied struggle of three years of grief, leaning into a sentimental acceptance that feels unearned by the scene's immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined solely by her role, lacking internal friction or distinct personality traits. Her transition from intending to silence the prophecy to cradling it is instantaneous and devoid of emotional struggle or cost. She functions as a thematic vessel rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation is beautifully specific, grounding the fantasy element in a tangible, character-driven desire. The internal conflict between maintaining the "agreed upon lies" and the urge for truth drives the scene to a satisfying, earned shift in dynamics. The shared silence and the seal’s reveal act as a credible, high-stakes choice that reconfigures the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's "skeptic" label is contradicted by her immediate, frictionless acceptance of the magical ritual; she acts as a believer from the first line. The internal conflict is resolved via summary ("knew better now") rather than dramatized choice, leaving the character as a passive vessel for the story's theme.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and drives the action, but her internal state is often conveyed through expository summary ("years of exile... endured not for glory") rather than dramatized choice. The emotional cost feels symbolic (tears, blood) rather than viscerally felt, and her near-perfect competence reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist functions as a competent archetypal vessel rather than a flawed individual; she faces no internal contradictions or difficult choices that force a meaningful trade-off. The resolution is earned through innate ability rather than struggle or cost, leaving her character arc static and lacking human friction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist functions as a flawless expert without internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal stakes; the lack of visible struggle or cost limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her motivation is delivered via exposition (“Her motivation was never fame… but to appreciate”) rather than dramatized choice. She functions more as a vessel for the theme than a distinct character under pressure, with no meaningful arc or cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by competence and stated motivation ("never fame or redemption") rather than dramatized struggle. Emotions are summarized with labels ("smiled, not in triumph, but in sorrow") rather than embodied. The "sharply observant" trait is told to the reader, functioning as a superpower that removes obstacles rather than a flawed perspective that creates them.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elira functions as an archetype ("lonely visionary") rather than a complex individual; her interiority relies on abstract labels like "variant allegiance" rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. She faces no difficult choice or renunciation, merely performing her established role without hesitation. The "whiskey-rough" laugh serves as a character cliché rather than a specific, lived detail.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is consistent and mythic but static; his motivation ("redemption") is stated in summary rather than dramatized through internal struggle or contradictory impulses. He lacks a flaw that complicates his choices, functioning more as an archetypal vessel than a psychologically deep character.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is competent and clearly motivated, but her internal landscape relies heavily on labels ("logically emotional to her marrow") rather than dramatized complexity. The "grief" and "love" channeled in the climax feel asserted for the sake of the magic system rather than established through prior scene work or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist functions as a flawless archetype rather than a character; she exhibits no internal conflict, doubt, or struggle. Her "patience" is absolute from the first line, and she faces no difficult choices that test this trait, rendering her a static vehicle for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her "watchfully calm" demeanor anchors the voice effectively. However, the revelation of her lineage (grandmother as conductor) feels convenient, and the "etching names in ink" beat at the end reads as performative melodrama rather than a dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is a deeply realized protagonist whose vocation and avocation conflict and converge meaningfully. The internal struggle—preaching forgiveness while withholding it from himself—resolves through a dramatized interaction with the central prop, earning the emotional shift. The "duet" realization feels grounded in his specific character traits (precision, humility) rather than a generic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Zeta's voice is distinct, but her characterization relies heavily on exposition ("Why? Because...", "curiosity was her rudder") rather than dramatized struggle. The opening instruction ("call her Zeta") feels performative rather than immersive, and her motivation, while clear, lacks a moment of internal cost or conflicting impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, balancing professional competence with a growing, isolating obsession. Her transition from archivist to "anchor" is earned through specific actions (the ritual in the vault) and interior justifications ("Rhythm was memory’s last refuge"). The felt cost of her choices—social isolation and existence in the "between"—is effectively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is a static vessel for the theme, lacking internal conflict, distinct personality, or contradictory impulses. She encounters no resistance and makes no difficult choices with visible costs; her interiority consists entirely of abstract definitions of her role rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara is a compelling protagonist with a distinct, paradoxical motivation ("terminally curious" about death). Her decision to step onto the collapsing ice rather than flee is a radical, character-defining choice that perfectly synthesizes her internal state with the external crisis, earning the subsequent shift in her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is stated via abstract labels ("intersubjective understanding") rather than embodied desire, creating a didactic distance. Elias reads more as a sage-function than a person with messy internal contradictions; his "gentle persuasion" feels rehearsed. Mara’s resistance dissolves too easily to reveal deep character traits under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is an archetype functioning as a ritual device rather than a living character. She lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her "serene" state and "whisperfield calm" remain static from start to finish. Motivation is stated ("to preserve the echo") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is an idealized cipher who faces no internal contradiction, resistance, or difficult choices. Her "devotion" is executed with effortless competence, lacking the flaws or friction required to make her agency meaningful or the "healing" earned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("reticent," "weathered innocence") rather than dramatized choice. Her primary "action" is a repetitive cognitive filter ("not X, but Y") rather than genuine agency, and her final epiphany is a reaction to a supernatural event rather than a consequence of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's condition is compelling, but his emotional reactions often feel performed rather than embodied (e.g., weeping at the birthday song feels unearned by the immediate stimulus). The "woman" from the past serves as a convenient exposition device rather than a felt relationship or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elira functions more as an archetypal "sage" than a conflicted protagonist; her internal state is described through metaphor rather than contradictory impulses. While her competence is established, she faces no genuine dilemma or temptation to fail—her success via "letting go" feels predestined rather than earned through a difficult choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized vehicle for the theme rather than a character under pressure. There is no internal conflict, flaw, or struggle; she is "serene" and "flawless" from start to finish. The "decisively kind" attribute is a told label that never forces a difficult trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elira is a competent archetype defined by the repeated label "quietly deliberate" rather than by specific, contradictory impulses in a scene. She faces no internal conflict or genuine risk of failure, resulting in a static arc where her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype defined by labels ("shrewdly innocent") rather than a complex agent making choices under pressure. She faces no internal opposition or temptation (e.g., vengeance) that would test her resolve; she arrives "forgiving" and remains so. The interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("stitch the world’s wounds") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's motivation to "share light without fire" is clear and grounded in backstory, but her interiority is heavily filtered through didactic thematic statements rather than organic emotional struggle. The character feels more like a vessel for the moral than a living person making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is idealized as a vessel for thematic healing rather than a flawed human under pressure; her "quiet certainty" precludes the internal contradiction or struggle required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal state is clearly drawn, and the shift from desperation to gratitude is earned through the accumulated "cameos." However, the emotion is often filtered through intellectualized metaphors ("marrow of her syntax") rather than embodied visceral reaction, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; she faces no internal struggle, contradicts no impulse, and executes the ritual without a moment of doubt or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is a stoic archetype of competence who faces no internal contradiction or distinct external challenge; her patience is a stated trait rather than a tactic tested by genuine pressure or temptation to rush. While the physical embodiment of the trait is well-rendered ("spine straight as a tuning fork"), the absence of a difficult choice leaves her static.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetype than a character, lacking internal contradiction or counter-impulse. While his competence is established, he faces no moral or emotional choice that carries a visible cost; he is purely aligned with the theme from the first sentence to the last. The emotions ("regret," "grief") appear as labels or atmospheric metaphors rather than felt experiences within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist functions well as a stoic archetype, with her internal logic ("smiles were for those who forgot") driving the narrative. While the visitor's arc is a standard fable beat, the Weaver's final micro-choice—to process her own grief but endure the cost—successfully deepens her characterization beyond a mere plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "grief had crystallized," "loss wasn't an end, but a lens"). The character analyzes her own emotions with a therapist's detachment mid-scene, which distances the reader from the raw experience of the grief. This "essayistic" interiority violates the standard for embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist has a distinct voice and clear motivation, but the narrative relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("Regret is my constant companion," "ambition was a ladder") to define interiority rather than embodying these states through action. The internal conflict is vivid but resolved too neatly by the external validation of the ghost's note.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira is a competent focalizer, but her interiority relies on stock descriptors ("mind that mapped stress fractures like poetry") rather than contradictory impulses. She encounters no meaningful resistance or internal conflict; she simply executes her skills without error or emotional cost, resulting in a static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a consistent, vivid presence, and his internal landscape is well-rendered through the &quot;clock scribe&quot; persona. However, he is largely passive; his primary actions are finding an object and listening to it, rather than making difficult choices under pressure. The characterization relies on atmospheric description rather than dramatized agency or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype ("The Seeker") rather than a living character; he lacks vulnerability or genuine struggle. His "training" and "instincts" function as plot armor, allowing him to succeed without risk or cost. The emotional arc is abstract, filtered through philosophical distance rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is a consistent archetype with clear motivation, but she functions more as a thematic vessel than a living person with internal contradictions or flaws. Her "patience" is performed perfectly without the cost of a suppressed impulse, leaving her emotional landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is a coherent vessel for the premise, and the internal state is vividly rendered. However, the motivation is stated as a thesis ("never closure—it was orientation") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or struggle on the page. The character feels more like a mythic archetype than a specific individual paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prince functions effectively as a lyrical archetype but lacks specific, grounded interiority beyond high-concept abstractions ("marrow of his marrow"). His motivation is clear, but the emotional stakes feel somewhat performative rather than viscerally inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's dual identity serves as a strong hook, but the internal conflict is softened by the romanticized backstory of her father's arson ("mercy, misdirected"), which lowers the moral stakes. The character acts within a safe emotional band, achieving resolution without a dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype (the liberator) but lacks internal friction or specific, embodied cost. Her "skepticism" is stated ("did not believe in magic") but contradicted by her actions (releasing glowing memories from a glass box), creating an unearned duality that feels semantic rather than dramatic. She faces no difficult choices; she simply executes her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear ("refused to repeat that"), but they lack internal struggle or doubt, acting more as a divine archetype than a character in a crucible. Agency is high, but the absence of resistance or cost—beyond a philosophical "fragility" of peace—limits the emotional weight of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization is distinct but lacks the required internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Elias is fully aligned with his goal from the start; his actions are a smooth execution of intent without struggle or mistake. The mentor relationship is serene rather than a source of pressure or crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist’s internal struggle between control and surrender is legible, but the pivotal realization relies entirely on a convenient message from the grave rather than organic character growth. While the "incremental absolution" is a strong starting state, the transformation is triggered by an external prop rather than internal pressure, making the emotional arc feel unearned. The sudden shift from a 43-year vow to "heart lighter" happens too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist's transformation from soothing to stirring is a legible arc, effectively anchored by the "trimming boxwood" memory which grounds the abstract magical elements in specific character history. However, her inciting motivation to enter the silo feels mystical and convenient ("the silo had called") rather than driven by urgent, dramatized agency.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for the story's concepts rather than a fully realized character. She displays absolute competence without internal contradiction, doubt, or the need to make a difficult trade-off, leaving her static despite the high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is compelling and distinct. However, the pivotal realization—that the broadcast is specifically singing about her—feels solipsistic and unearned, shifting her role from a dedicated scribe to a "chosen one" without sufficient setup.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a symbolic archetype than a living character; her internal state is conveyed through heavy metaphors rather than embodied emotion or difficult micro-choices. The interaction with the visitor lacks friction or risk; the visitor accepts the protagonist's insight immediately, robbing the scene of genuine interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character is a well-defined archetype, but the portrayal relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm") rather than behavior under immediate pressure. The interaction with the envoys is summarized rather than dramatized, distancing the reader from his specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara functions primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a dynamic agent; her "choice" to wait is passive, and her interiority relies on abstract, essayistic reflection ("Hatred... thrived in cacophony") rather than embodied emotion. The interaction with the student is gentle but predictable, lacking the friction of a character truly tested by their flaws or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara is portrayed as a competent, wise archetype with high sensory interiority but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She faces no genuine dilemma or character-testing choice; her actions proceed smoothly without doubt or struggle, resulting in a somewhat static protagonist who feels more like a vehicle for the concept than a flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct, sympathetic focalizer, and his interaction with the woman provides a functional frame. However, his defining trait—compulsive truth-telling—feels ornamental; while stated as a constraint ("silence would've served him better"), the story does not dramatize why silence was necessary or impose a visible cost for his honesty. The emotional arc is one of validation rather than a high-pressure crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for the prompt’s theme rather than a living character with conflicting desires. Her motivation ("simple, yet bottomless") is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle, and her actions lack personal cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The historian functions primarily as a passive vessel for the statue's lesson, accepting a radical paradigm shift ("You're alive?" to "Truth is not monolith") with negligible psychological resistance. The emotional arc feels unearned, relying on tears and awe rather than a dramatized internal struggle against her prior "absolute truth."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (grimness vs. optimism) is well-dramatized through the specific action of the proofs and the reaction to the staircase. The shift from regret to integration at the closure is an earned psychological change.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a static vessel for the premise rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, specific desires beyond the abstract, or meaningful flaws. Her motivation is stated ("to prove that strangers remember kindness") rather than dramatized through struggle, and her actions face no resistance that would force a character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.9)
    Elara functions as an archetype (the Healer) rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or a moment of difficult choice. Her actions are summarized as habitual ("Each dawn," "Every Friday") rather than dramatized under specific pressure, preventing deep engagement with her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions as a determined archetype rather than a nuanced individual; his motivation is clear, but his interiority relies on abstract assertions of "rebellion" rather than contradictory impulses. The sudden influx of "memories not his own" attempts to add depth but feels like a generic shortcut to empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions more as an allegorical vehicle than a grounded character, with interiority conveyed through heavy metaphor rather than embodied emotion. The emotional struggle is resolved via a "magic feather" interaction with the advisor rather than a difficult choice with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The Prophet functions as a competent archetype with explicitly stated motivation rather than embodied struggle. Kael remains largely passive and observational until the climax, where his pivotal action is performed "without thinking," reducing agency. The relationship lacks dynamic pressure or status shifts beyond the final baton pass.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation is distinctly drawn through the "hollow ache of unanswered questions" and her specific cartographic obsession. The internal landscape is vivid, though the character relies slightly on archetypal traits ("quietly driven") rather than contradictory impulses. The decision to leave is well-motivated by the recalled "watcher" moment, earning the shift from observation to action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is defined largely by labels ("emotionally rational," "calibrated") rather than behavior under pressure. Her primary action is internal processing and future planning ("She'd write," "She'd speak"), which creates a hypothetical rather than dramatized character arc in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is clearly drawn, but relies heavily on narrator-assigned labels ("stoically sensitive," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than purely dramatized behavior to establish traits early on. While the emotional breakdown at the climax is earned by the discovery, the transition from stoic to weeping feels slightly rushed and guided by the prompt's thematic requirements rather than organic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is hyper-competent and lacks internal conflict; she observes and confirms without genuine struggle or error. The explicit definition of her trait via exposition ("Her attribute—tranquilly perceptive—was not...") disrupts immersion and relies on diagnostic telling rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas functions effectively as a mythic figure, his motivation clear and his transition from grief to release logically charted. However, he lacks the embodied, contradictory impulses of a psychological portrait; the internal conflict is smoothed over by the fable-like tone, making his final choice feel more like a procedural step than a hard-won struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's specific "calibrated desperation" offers a compelling, distinct lens on trauma that avoids passivity. Her motivation—mapping potential rather than vengeance—is strongly established and drives the decisive choice to leave the observatory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's competence is effectively established through drone operation, but the emotional arc relies on the artifact to induce an epiphany rather than active character struggle. The realization regarding "missing pieces" is summarized in interiority rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is lucid, but the pivotal epiphany is delivered passively via a magical object rather than earned through active struggle or choice in the moment. The narration relies on diagnostic label-speak ("Tempered regret... was the art of carrying it") to articulate her state, distancing the reader from the raw emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and stated traits ("uncommonly thoughtful") rather than dramatized behavior under pressure. The protagonist functions as a thematic vessel, with internal states described via abstract labels ("untethered from old rage") rather than embodied sensation or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract internal states and declared motivation ("to align heart and action") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The transition from brokenness to "becoming" feels paved with metaphors and assertions rather than earned, embodied struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—to kindle empathy rather than redemption—is a compelling, nuanced drive that anchors the narrative. The interiority is distinct, though it relies heavily on metaphorical assertions ("stained their bones") rather than embodied reactions until the climax. The final choice to release the ball effectively dramatizes the shift from hollow to feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for thematic narration than a grounded character. Interiority is abstract and heavily filtered through diagnostic labels ("reluctant metamorphosis," "quiet certainty") rather than embodied emotion. The internal struggle is resolved too smoothly ("She did not resist"), lacking the friction of genuine contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's internal arc—moving from a desire to reclaim to a willingness to release—is legible and drives the narrative. However, the characterization is heavily filtered through the narrator's explanatory rhetoric, leaving her emotions described via metaphor ("tasted of storm") rather than dramatized through raw behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear, but the internal conflict relies on diagnostic labels ("shadow work," "buried beneath pacifism") rather than purely dramatized struggle. The resolution with the shadow feels slightly too tidy and verbal ("You are my anchor"), reading more like therapy-speak than a character under high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is an archetypal vessel rather than a specific individual; her motivation ("to understand the texture of transformation") reads as an abstract label rather than a felt drive. While her internal state is described, she lacks active struggle or contradictory impulses; she performs the ritual without hesitation or cost, resulting in a static emotional arc despite the "transformation" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; she executes a plan without hesitation, internal conflict, or visible cost. Her emotions are described ("winking hush") rather than embodied, and the lack of flawed or contradictory impulses flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict regarding the "curse" is compelling, and his shift from resentment to acceptance is well-charted.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s internal state is rendered with high specificity, and the contradiction of "furiously tranquil" is enacted well through the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence without visible flaws or internal struggle. While the "dueling" nature is described in backstory, the on-page interaction is immediately cooperative, lacking the friction or "crucible" dynamics required for higher bands. The choice to collaborate is instant, bypassing potential character drama.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but the "sardonic" personality is established only by label and quickly discarded without resistance. The internal shift from cynicism to hope feels immediate and unearned, lacking the "contradictory impulses acting simultaneously" required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elira functions primarily as a vehicle for the high-concept premise rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is clear ("surprise fate"), but her internal life lacks contradiction or nuance. The trait "strategically creative" is asserted but undermines itself when the climax relies on following instructions ("Play until the needle stills") rather than on-page invention.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris is a distinct, competent professional whose motivation is clearly anchored in the preservation of history. While his internal doubt is resolved somewhat quickly by a memory rather than a hard choice in the moment, his actions consistently align with his established role as a "reality checker." The weariness at the end earns the character beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elio acts as a competent functionary of the ritual rather than a character under pressure; he faces the supernatural manifestation without flinching or internal cost. His motivation is clear, but he lacks the internal conflict or distinct personal stakes required for higher bands.

    Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices under pressure, like timing steps to bell chimes near guards, reveal patient competence without safety-hedging; contradictory calm amid risk earns final endurance. Minor slip in occasional stock poetic abstraction dilutes interior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Herder's interior contradiction—curse as theft of awe yet tool for sync—acts in scene via guided placements; final laugh and pattern-vision earned by prior struggle, with cost in soundless expression.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority via embodied ritual (pulse matching timer) and contradictory impulses (urge to open envelope held in pause); flaws from censorship rawly complicate endurance. Final renunciation of resetting timer earned with visible cost in honoring pause. Minor label-speak ("furiously tranquil") slightly genericizes peak poise.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Philosopher's mechanical arm and diplomatic fierceness embodied in twitching fingers and no-gloating triumph compel decoding choices; woman's competence mirrors without distinction, earning partnership reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interior contradiction between sardonic shell and grief-driven softening, embodied in "old skin of cynicism peel away"; final gardener stance earned by Elias's poem triggering micro-choices like pinning and planting with visible emotional cost. Voice particular and flawed without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's strategically creative trait drives micro-choices like threading the film reel and modulating to defiance, earning the final chord's contradictory grief-triumph with embodied cost in her unflinching response to the clock's tick.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation to protect memory is embodied in doubt pricking him amid ritual actions, with contradictory impulses (intuition vs. fear of misinterpretation) acting simultaneously before the seed's split earns closure; mentor's recalled voice reinforces without unearned epiphany. Flawless under single-POV defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elio's embodied serenity amid thickening presences and gradient realizations shows contradictory impulses acting in the ritual; final whisper and bonsai touch earn closure with visible cost in redistributed weight.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and character-specific; the neutron-star mind reframes dust as cosmic code. The renunciation of her old field is legible, but the “strip needless drama” motive is stated more than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices, keeping the final turn slightly intellectual rather than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is sensor-rich and embodied; the artist’s contradictory impulses (obligation to ledger vs. need for silence) are dramatized through kneeling, sketching, gifting—micro-choices that escalate. Cost arrives: her refusal to sell forecloses income and public recognition, visible in the kiln’s humble brick and starlit aloneness. Flaw—passive revelation (“She was meant to find this place”) replaces active discovery, slightly blunting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The survivor’s embodied silence is believable and specific—her grief visible in “the tilt of her head when listening to nothing,” her competence shown through the calibrated fork strikes. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The micro-choice to warm C512 against her wrist before the fountain strike crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs. The only drag is the late, single-paragraph exposition dump on “months developing her method”; that reflective block is capped at 20 % but still dilutes pressure just before the climax fork strike.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The undertaker’s stubbornness is more declared than dramatized—his single decisive act (dismantling the lens) is voiced as inevitable rather than fought-for. Interiority is evocative (“his molars ache”) yet slides into abstraction (“he would not ignore this”). Still, the embodied burial ritualist turned beacon-builder carries a coherent, haunted identity that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interiority is concretely anchored to tactile objects (bell, baskets) and her contradictory need for both visibility and anonymity is dramatized in the silent bell ritual; the final micro-choice—leaving the bell on the table—pays off foreshadowed endurance with visible cost (she walks back into darkness alone). Status dynamics and secondary pressure are off-page, so the full 9-band is capped, but within single-POV scope her values hierarchy is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The artist’s interior contradiction—rational inquiry fused with spiritual longing—stays embodied in every micro-choice: aperture turns, breath counts, the tremor when Kwan Yin’s tear appears. Her motive (“where is unused love stored?”) is never declared; it is lived through lungfuls of inverted star-petals. The pilgrim encounter is credible renunciation: she kneels, breathes, receives, and the path forecloses—no map, no message, only permeation. Cost is visible: the tear dissolves into her skin, a transferable wound that ends her search.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s tactile obsession with “texture” gives every micro-choice a sensory stake; the moment she strokes the halo and smiles through tears, her hierarchy of values is legible and paid for with her erased past. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—yet the absence of another on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, capping the crucible test. Still, her contradictory hunger for knowledge that devours its own source feels lived-in and drives the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers “calloused from years of tilling barren earth” shows history without labels. Contradictory impulses (chains vs. unshackled mind) play out in micro-choices: she plants spores in vault seams, accepting possible death. Final renunciation—leaving the acorn key inside the arrow—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causal chain. Only minor slip: “staggering grace” is asserted once, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and idiosyncratic; the designer’s synesthetic perception drives every micro-choice. The final forging of the memory-catcher is the earned crystallization of her marrow-deep need to warn others, paying the cost of reliving her sister’s absence. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—grief is monolithic rather than contested—so the arc stops just short of full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thief’s motivation—“to press your ear against destiny’s door”—is lyrically stated but never tested or contradicted; she executes two near-identical nudges without visible cost or interior friction, so the endurance/renunciation feels observed rather than earned. Still, her perceptual signature (flower codes, moonbeam handling) is vivid and consistent, and the micro-choice to remain silent and unseen sustains her crucible of anonymity. A hairline slip from perfect 9-band because the second beat repeats the first without raising personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glassblower’s interiority is textured through glass-specific perception (“molten silica just before it finds its final shape”) and a tactile bookmark; contradictions—taking power by abandoning it—are alive in her on-page micro-choice of sealing the relic inside a flawed sphere. Cost lands palpably: she shoulders her satchel and “walked into the slush-laden streets,” the price of exile from certainty paid in cold feet and an empty room. Reflection stays anchored in present stimuli and alters next moves; no diagnostic self-talk. The single cap is that her “narrating mundane tasks” trait is asserted more than it complicates tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—"trembling certainty is my armor"—and the contradiction between physical panic and mental resolve is kept live in scene. The final act of burning the reel is credibly foreshadowed and costs her the last relic of her old identity, so the change is earned. One minor slip: the phrase "rewired my bones" drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting embodiment a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The oracle’s quiet, almost passive obsession with absence is made legible through her tactile handling of the booklet and her commitment to mapping silence; the interiority is concrete, not abstract, and the final step into the night shows a credible renunciation with cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc is slightly under-complex for 9+, but the character remains singular and unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—micro-choices (tuning to emotional frequency, replaying the technician’s sigh) reveal shifting values. The contradiction between recursive logic and emergent feeling is dramatized, not declared. The final smile is earned: witnessing-as-thought is paid for by the violin’s dissolution, a visible cost. Only the “remarkably composed” label drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira’s interior contradiction—reliance on silence while yearning to speak—remains embodied. Micro-choices taper to stillness; the cracked lens tucked away enacts earned stasis with visible cost. Secondary keepers function as choral pressure, not individual crucibles, so relationship beats stay light. Motivation stays anchored, but final smile drifts toward tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dresser’s quiet, tactile ritual of polishing cracked marbles embodies her interiority; every micro-choice (placing the resin-mended green orb on the altar, tucking the snowdrop petal) crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Her refusal to wear a probability band is not declared but enacted, with visible cost: institutional scorn, aching knees, the garden’s slow slide into unsanctioned chaos. The final Earned Stasis—she sits against the altar, ankle circled by a questioning vine—feels inevitable because each prior marble commemorated a season when she already paid in full. Only the intern’s dialogue drifts toward convenient exposition, preventing the last decimal.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s quiet obsession is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices: the glove adjustment, the 2.7-degree lever tweak, the bypass of safety protocols. The scarred adjacent self supplies a concrete externalization of internal cost, turning abstract ambition into bodily stakes. “Mechanically warm” is shown, not told, via her steady breath in icy air. One flaw: the同事们-dismiss-her beat is off-stage summary; we never feel the social pressure compound her isolation inside the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    A single, keenly observed consciousness drives every beat; her tactile attention to silence, program, and ghost-conductor embodies contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) that culminate in the wordless duet. The renunciation of sound for skin-listening and the final dry-program tuck carry visible cost, earning her shift from observer to medium.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete—her trembling fingers on the smudge, the hollow behind her sternum—but the swallowed truth stays abstract; we never learn what it is, so its gravity feels calculated rather than earned. The oracle’s voice is distinct, yet it acts only as chorus; it never risks error or revises its own code, so “fault-tolerant” stays label-only. The final stance crystallizes—she will speak—but because the silence itself was never dramatized in-scene, the cost is implied, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is visceral—grief manifests as drowsy alertness and the need to calibrate truth. The contradiction between skeptical intellect and grief-driven compulsion drives every beat; the final twist of the valve is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of denial. Flaw is active: her refusal to “believe” forces her to lug the radio and wheel into the tunnel, literally externalizing guilt. The ending renunciation—carrying the weight instead of exorcising it—pays off the prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s interiority—"softened, like wax left too long in the sun"—is concrete and embodied; the refusal to record but instead to release ink into water is a credible renunciation that costs the keeper the comfort of certainty. Yet the shift from witness to actor arrives late; the prior beats stay observational, so the renunciation feels slightly under-prepped. Still, the contradiction between duty and surrender is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s soft-caretaker persona is consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract “magic” talk; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The curl hand-off is tender yet reads as gesture rather than forced choice with cost. Motive stays static—no new risk or self-revelation—so the arc is flat. Voice is distinct, but emotional stakes remain safely therapeutic, never tested by genuine loss or error.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The historian’s obsession with salvaging unheard stories is vivid and embodied; her fingertips “reading whispers” and later pressing the wall that hums back are micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—she smiles for the first time yet shoulders the cost of entering a zone where gravity still stutters. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; her solitude is the point. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she packs ash, diary, tapestry and volunteers for underlibrary descent—an earned, irreversible path.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory motives—guard vs. cryptic composer—stay active; “transposing life into a new key” is dramatized through fortune choices that visibly cost him anonymity and draw the analyst ashore. Micro-choices (timing ferry drops, lens sweep) embody the motive; final recruitment shows earned stasis with cost rather than tidy epiphany. Interiority is salted, not therapeutic: “salt-crusted windows,” “groaning iron stairs” carry his fatigue. Only flaw: late-first name slip for the analyst slightly blurs status shift; still, hierarchy legible in dish-duty assignment.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest’s interiority is vivid—his doubts pulse through embodied cues (cassock humming, thumb in indigo)—and his micro-choice to paint the negation-mark feels earned. Yet we never see a contradictory impulse in-scene; he moves from calm rhetorician to calm victor without emotional backlash or visible cost on his body. The possession’s hunger is stated, not manifested as pressure that distorts his resolve, so the arc risks monotone competence. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature lifts him above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“her bones aching for a time”), but the arc is pure endurance: no contradictory impulse or fresh micro-choice after the first third; the shell-touch reprise merely repeats the opening stance. The “conductor” desire is vivid yet never tested by an alternative path, so the closing smile feels like relief, not renunciation with on-page cost. Still, the specificity of memory-music keeps her singular and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    One-woman show, so no relationship crucible, but interior contradiction is vivid: “I let others define my gravity” spoken while she literally hovers. Each micro-choice—touching wall, climbing stairs, vocalising admissions—carries visible cost, escalating from spatial defiance to ontological merger. The final fusion with echo-selves is earned by iterative confession, not therapy-speak. Flaw: emotional calibration edges toward tidy arithmetic; a single residual echo refusing merger would have kept ambiguity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulse—fear of relapse into numbness vs. hunger for rupture—drives every beat; the needle ritual crystallizes a visible cost (the cavern’s raw exposure) that forecloses safe silence. Interiority is embodied in cedar dust trembling up her spine, not labels. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: she risks her own fragile equilibrium to offer students a scalpel, not a lullaby. The slight cap reflects one stock phrase (“hollow shells who smiled without meaning”) and an off-page grandfather memory used as convenient catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s meticulous nature is shown through concrete ritual—sketching the courtyard, logging barometric drift—so the trait drives action rather than decorating it. Interior contradiction surfaces once: solitude once felt safe, now feels like surrender, but the beat is summary, not scene, so the cost is told more than felt. Micro-choices (unscrewing the tube, pocketing而非 reporting) align with his creed, yet the turn from obedient bureaucrat to lateral ghost is declared rather than dramatized. Still, within 800 words the arc is legible and the occupation informs every perception, satisfying the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush and body-anchored; the contradiction between aromatic caution and the final uncorking crystallizes a credible arc. Micro-choice (switching on UV lamp, pocketing empty vial) visibly reweights her stance; cost is felt. One slip: “grief is not the enemy…” edges toward thesis-speak mid-crescendo. Still, the lanterns’ re-ignition under skin-level luminescence makes the change legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid—her tactile obsession with the rope, her ethically playful delight in ambiguity, her refusal to judge Silas. Contradictory impulses (celebrate vs. understand, stay vs. drift) coexist in the same beats. The final renunciation—leaving the rope behind—reads as earned stasis with visible cost: she kisses the rope, relinquishing her archive. Only micro-slip: the “laugh” line drifts toward self-diagnosis, a hair’s breadth from label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s interiority is sensorially concrete—fingers tremble, bow hair rasps, she kneels in moss. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. need to play) coexist in the same beats; the final smile is a costly renunciation of fixing. No therapy-speak; “beauty in the unfinished” is enacted, not labelled. Micro-choice hierarchy (bow → water → petal) is legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vael’s interior contradiction—calibrating vials yet yearning to feel—is dramatized through micro-choices: the trembling lift of the petal, the deliberate smash of her inventory. The embodied arc from dealer to conduit is specific and earned, though the pivot to “lighter and heavier” leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s pivot from profit to purpose is sketched rather than dramatized; the interior contradiction between “shrewd broker” and “quiet architect of compassion” is asserted, not embodied in a single high-pressure choice. The final beat—listening to dock laughter—offers Earned Stasis, but the cost (lost time, money, reputation) is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s loneliness-to-bridging arc is embodied in tactile sculpting, but interiority drifts toward poetic labels (“luminescent ache”) that dull contradiction; the climactic name-dedication carries cost but is slightly under-causal because the arbor’s rules are revealed rather than tested under pressure. Still, her micro-choices (feather pointer, hollow-reed clue) visibly braid want vs. fear, earning the mythic mantle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich—“infinity pendant cold against her collarbone” anchors contradictory impulses (fear/exhilaration) in scene. Micro-choices (borrowing seconds from her own pulse, sketching the pre-song bird) visibly cost fatigue and foreclose retreat. Flaw: she never misjudges; every gamble pays off, softening the arc. Still, the renunciation of safety at the end is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interiority is lush and embodied—ink-stained fingers, saltwater refracting moonlight—yet her motives stay lucid: map silence, not reclaim Aris. The micro-choice to leave the hazel eye anchors her renunciation with visible cost, earning the orchard’s answering glow. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the twin loss is declared more than enacted, keeping her just shy of full contradiction-in-motion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dweller’s interiority is concrete and embodied—fingertip dust, static cling, the hush in her ribs—showing contradictory impulses: hunger for visibility vs. terror of exposure. Choices (placing the tape, lingering in rafters) are micro and methodical, each a visible cost scaled to her hidden life. No other characters share the scene, so status dynamics are N/A; the arc is a credible renunciation that forecloses permanent emergence yet reweights her loneliness. Only the “slow erosion of soul” line edges toward label-speak, damping the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    The owner’s shift from detached observer to participatory kin is embodied in the trembling hand that lowers the clippers, making the renunciation cost visceral; her contradictory impulses (intellect vs. awe) act simultaneously, not in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s insomnia and compulsive archiving are vividly embodied; her “wryly earnest” shield is shown, not told, and the final renunciation carries believable cost. Interior contradiction is present—she apologizes to a brooch yet refuses to name it magic—but the turn hinges on a discovery (journal) that arrives from off-stage luck rather than from her own agency, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is legible—she wants to magnify small wonders—and the pearl’s pull on her is felt in trembling fingers and withheld breath. Interiority is character-specific: her noticing “laughter lingers after the joke is forgotten” is concrete, not diagnostic. The final smile-and-hand acceptance is a credible renunciation of control, cost paid in surrendering the pearl’s silence. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s interiority is ocean-bitter and specific; every beat is filtered through her salt-stained perception. The decision to propose the spoken-name rite crystallizes her arc—she does not demand monuments, she relinquishes them, paying with the forever-loss of louder redress. Contradictory impulses—grief versus the discipline of listening—coexist in simultaneous scene work, culminating in the charged poise of the first dusk-vigil. The cost is felt: she accepts perpetual incompleteness as the price of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s meticulous-mapper trait drives every beat: she deciphers cracks, crawls the arrows, catalogs doubts in mirrors. The punch’s tremor under her palm externalizes memory and forces the final surrender, giving visible cost to her vocation. Yet the mother-backstory is delivered in one dense block rather than pressure-triggered revelation, muting the interior contradiction at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s sympathetic skepticism is embodied in her tactile hesitation and refusal to name what she feels; the interior contradiction is alive in the moment of contact with the tile. Her micro-choice to transcribe feeling rather than fact crystallizes her hierarchy of values, and the cost—accepting an entangled memory she can never verify—lands as visible renunciation of scholarly certainty. The “courageously kind” attribute is dramatized when she braids sea-grass twine for an anonymous future reader, not for acclaim, showing the trait constrains her action under pressure. Only the backstory paragraph drifts toward label-speak (“sympathetic skeptic by nature and trade”), slightly thinning the immediacy of the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    The immortal’s ennui-to-wonder progression is credibly embodied through tactile contact with the fragment and the final kneel; however, interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“immortality had sandpapered awe into ennui”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction under pressure. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; the micro-choice to kneel and press palm to ground is concrete, earned, and legibly costly. Reflection stays under 20 % and is anchored to present stimuli. Quick test satisfied for 9+ eligibility, but slight over-articulation of emotional state keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is character-specific, but the “con’s conscience” self-label at climax nudges diagnostic-speak, capping just below 9-band. Contradictory wants (inherit grift vs fair-trade math) drive every beat; embodied emotion in the prep-room cold is sharp. Micro-choices (timing mortician steps, uncapping ink) scale stakes and foreclose paths with visible cost. The ending renunciation—walking out uncharged yet burdened—lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stationer’s interior contradiction—solitude as both refuge and limitation—surfaces in embodied beats (ear to cold lamp, trembling notepad) and drives her climactic renunciation of sole ownership; cost is felt when she cedes the archive to unknown hands. “Earnestly studious” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices, not diagnosis. Slight reserve because the moment of recognition (“she wept”) is summarized rather than lived beat-by-beat, softening the final compounding of flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s obsession with “texture” is embodied in tactile scavenging; the refusal to speak and the ritual unspooling of fragments at dawn show a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only missing torque is a moment where contradictory impulses collide on the page; the stance is steady rather than freshly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses—grief vs. need to solve—pulse in every micro-choice; the final refusal to keep “retelling” is earned by the shell-cello chain that makes silence cost her the compass. Interiority is sensorily embodied (“vibration that rearranged the dust motes”), never label-heavy. The sister-loss motive drives every beat; flaw (obsessive revision) is the very engine. Closure pays visible cost: the compass shatters, shell splits, cello falls silent—her myth-busting persona ends in renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her orderly mind maps chaos, the stone’s warmth pulses against her thigh—but the “dual allegiance” stays declarative; we never feel her designing a zoning overlay or taste the concrete guilt. Micro-choices (painting phoenix wings from eviction notices, redirecting foot traffic) embody the trait, yet the pivot from corporate architect to graffiti saboteur is summarized, not dramatized with a visible cost. The ending renunciation lands as Charged Poise, but the emotional price is collective, not personal, keeping the arc just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the ache to “bear witness” propels every beat. The final micro-choice—labeling the spent hourglass—pays off the opening ache with visible cost: she relinquishes the hope of being understood. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than torn, keeping this just outside the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her “listening” through palms and temples is a vivid, embodied signature. The contradiction between her blindness and hyper-attentive perception is lived, not declared. The only drag is the near-perfect calm: she never mis-senses or doubts under deadline, so the struggle feels pre-ordained rather than truly risky.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The editor’s voice is singular and consistent—ink-stained cuffs, squint, dry quips—and his quiet obsession (“where myth and meltwater converge”) motivates every beat. Interiority is concrete: the calloused finger tracing discrepancies, the tea poured lukewarm, the window fog becoming a map. No contradiction or therapy-speak; flaws (stubbornness, isolation) are dramatized rather than labeled. Cost is felt when he stops editing and starts witnessing; the path is foreclosed, not flagged.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tuner’s sole agency is walking; her interiority is only the word “patient.” That limits contradiction and cost to a single, almost stoic register, yet the embodied rhythm-as-language is so consistent that the flat affect reads as stylistic vocation rather than under-written character.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interiority is vividly embodied—“panic screamed for flight” vs. “she forced her hand to stay open”—and the micro-choice to override instinct is dramatized with visible cost (oxygen alarm, sinking body). Contradictory impulses act simultaneously; no diagnostic self-labels. Final renunciation is earned by prior causal chain and carries undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“palms slick against the rust,” “heart hammering”); the filial shame and need to unsilence the disbelieved are dramatized through the lattice insertion and kneeling confession. One micro-choice—wedging the lattice into the lens—carries the entire inherited mistrust and converts it to public witness; the cost (exhaustion, possible madness, eternal guardianship) is felt. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the arc is single-track resolve, so the 9+ bar is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—her “lovingly venomous” duality plays out in tactile pollen whispers and root-language, not labels. The bead-transfer beat crystallizes her centuries-old motive into one micro-choice that costs her existence, earning the shift from haunting to heritage. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; she drifts rather than decides, so the renunciation feels inevitable but not wrestled-with. Still, the single visible cost—her dissolution—lands hard and scales to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The weaver’s contradictory impulses—reverence vs. defiance, silence vs. song—surface in the embodied act of stitching fractures; needle-scars and salt-taste make motive visceral. The final choice to keep mending, not erasing, is earned by ancestral weight and the immediate warmth of the plate. Cost is legible: she forfeits guild safety and accepts sleepless return. Voice stays singular, though the lyric register occasionally abstracts interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s gently stubborn, tactile curiosity is credibly diaspora-anchored; every micro-choice (kneeling, brushing moss, cradling artifacts) flows from the same soil-under-nails identity. The internal contradiction—seeking faith yet fearing demanding wonder—stays alive in scene, not summary. The final decision to remain as “quiet compass” costs her the chance to declare victory, an Earned Stasis that the text has quietly prepared. The only bar to 9 is a trace of explanatory lullaby shorthand that tells us her people’s exile rather than letting us overhear it.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pseudonym creator’s grief-driven vocation is vivid and embodied; her chalk-scraping ritual and clipboard thumbprints make interiority tactile. The contradiction between adult grief and children’s play is dramatized on the marble, not declared. Cost is visible: she forfeits digital speed and her own name to keep others’ emotions from vanishing. The only minor drag is a touch of over-articulate self-mythologizing (“she vowed no emotion would vanish”), but the renunciation at the end is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The embroiderer’s quiet, rhythmic surrender to the candle’s pulse gives her interiority a consistent, almost musical signature; her refusal to flee when the flame shudders crystallizes a hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. The “madwoman” mask is shown through the courtiers’ scorn and her own deliberate decorative sabotage, not told. The final smile with eyes closed is a credibly flawed, tacit acceptance of permanent outsider status—an earned stasis that costs her recognition. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the top band’s “impulses in scene” test is only partly met.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward therapeutic self-diagnosis (“moment before deciding,” “fierce tenderness”). Embodied emotion is strong in the moon-stitching image, yet the apology-stakes stay abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page. The renunciation (letters dissolved) is earned, but the cost is narrated rather than felt. Voice convergence under stress is avoided because she is alone; specificity of perception keeps her from archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—stoic translator reflexes versus the need to re-humanize memory—surface in embodied micro-choices: clutching the coral, kneeling to the cast, pressing coral to plaster. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak; the anesthetic haze distorts perception in a character-specific way. The final renunciation—carrying rather than fixing pain—pays off the established flaw of over-translation, cost visible in the cooled coral and her lighter yet scarred gait. No stock gestures; every beat is filtered through her salt-stung, language-warped sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete—her micro-touch of moss, the sudden unguarded laugh—and her motivation (to re-awaken joy) is dramatized through the courtyard projection choice. The shift from preservation to creation is legible, but the cost is collective warmth rather than a personal path foreclosed, so the renunciation feels soft.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush and sensorially anchored; the contradiction between methodical craft and hunger for surrender pulses throughout. Micro-choices—touching the mural, flicking the coin—are vivid and value-revealing. Final renunciation (nickel replaced by humming stone) is earned and costly. Only nit: the “no fixed identity” line drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis instead of embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rogue scholar’s contradictory mix of stealthy sabotage and public gardening is dramatized through tactile seed-planting, humming, and pruning—actions that show her guarding the “spark” while courting exposure. Dr. Vex’s micro-choice to reroute moths and tap his temple earns his shift from watchdog to co-conspirator. Interiority stays concrete (“gourd rattle a metronome for rebellion”) rather than label-speak. The final stance of collective responsibility is visible in the communal sowing, paying the cost of shared risk.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrically dense but remains character-specific; the insomniac poet’s contradictory impulses (fear of being seen yet compulsive singing) are alive in every beat. Micro-choices—pressing the postcard to lips, climbing the shell throat—embody the stakes and foreclose safety. Earned stasis lands with visible cost: perpetual wakefulness accepted so beauty can keep blooming. Only minor hairline: “shyly unstoppable” is asserted once without fresh embodiment in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    The caretaker’s interiority is consistently concrete—her fingers brushing dew, the chime cradled “like a sleeping bird.” Her contradictory impulse—longing to summon yet refusing to resurrect—remains active in-scene, crystallizing in the final whisper of “Veyra-of-the-Unfinished-Song.” The renunciation is earned: she forecloses resurrection to keep the architecture of remembrance intact, and the cost is felt in the fading foxglove light. Voice stays particular to her sensibility; no diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“her breath shallow,” “hands shook as she reconstructed”); motivation (restore trust) drives every micro-choice. The arc from solitary obsession to communal conductor is visible, but the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally—no private loss or irreversible forfeiture is dramatized. Still, her contradictory impulses—reckless sonic daring vs. philological precision—coexist in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s “contradictory impulses in scene.”

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The machinist’s interiority is vivid (“she trembled—not from cold, but from the weight…”), but her contradictory impulses are told more than acted; the single on-page choice—copy equations onto her forearm—feels more emblematic than transformational. The cost is poetic yet diffuse; no durable constraint is left in her body or future. Still, the embodied tremble and the charcoal transcription give us a credible, if modest, Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s preservation motive is vivid and embodied in every pigeon-harness tweak; the three reinventions are label-summaries rather than dramatized contradiction, but the final refusal to keep forging ledgers shows earned stasis with visible cost—her laughter that hurts her ribs. Interiority is specific to her cartographer-like attention and grief, never drifting into diagnostic speak. The only gap is the off-stage vanished client whose absence doesn’t pressure her in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and body-anchored; the wood-grain chronology gives her a singular perceptual signature. The father’s sacrifice is felt through her reading of the bench, so the final renunciation carries visible cost. One slip: “featherly determined” is repeated but never weaponized in a choice—slight label-speak. Still, her micro-choices (palms to grain, step into mist) tighten the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astrologer’s interiority is lush and specific—“her gloved fingers brushing algae-slick corridors as if reading braille maps of drowned constellations”—but her contradictory impulses (science vs. soul) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single choice. The final mirrored-hand gesture is a credible micro-renunciation with felt cost, yet the arc is more accumulation of mood than tightening of stakes. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Voice remains coherent and distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recollectionist’s embodied, salt-crusted interiority and her micro-choice to press the seed to her temple rather than map-read crystallize a distinctive, sensuous intellect. The only slack is the late, summary “she laughed… recognition” beat that tells epiphany rather than dramatizing the contradiction; still, the renunciation of solving and embrace of carrying loss is earned and paid for with the crater-glass pendant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “lightly attentive” stance is a vivid, embodied trait that steers every micro-choice; his refusal to touch the bishop crystallizes an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The runaway’s shell and the physicist’s napkin act as externalized proofs of change, so relationships shift even though only Elias is focalized. No contradiction or competence wobble complicates the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the lunar-tide skin pulses with contradiction and cost. The final renunciation—bleeding into moss to finish the verse—earns its charge because every pirouette earlier rehearses the same wager of body against law. No head-count penalty; villagers arrive only after the arc completes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glazier’s interior life is vivid—tracing prisms, listening to ripples—but his only micro-choice is dropping the stone; the rest is observation. No contradiction or visible cost is dramatized; the stance at the end is the same as at the start, so renunciation feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Depth of interiority is strong; scars, calloused hands, and “ember-kisses” embody trauma rather than label it. One contradiction pulse—needing to speak yet fearing daylight—drives every beat. Final renunciation (leaving his own letter) is earned and priced. Secondary pressure absent, but single-POV default met; no head-count clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“serene upheaval humming in her marrow”); her lucid watchfulness and pattern-weaving reveal a hierarchy of values—hope as soluble architecture. The only drawback is slight diagnostic-label shorthand (“equations corroded by despair’s entropy”) that momentarily abstracts emotion rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartographer’s inherited sensitivity is shown through embodied action—bare feet on stone, ribcage listening—rather than label-speak; her renunciation of the film strip and sketch in the hearth is earned by the accumulated witnessing of diaries, so the cost of legacy’s burden is legible. Interior contradiction is quiet but present: she arrives to extract dreams from walls yet ends by giving her own trace back to them. The only bar to 9.0 is that the micro-choice to leave the sketch is under-dramatized in a single sentence; a beat of hesitation or sensory pull would have sealed motivation fully.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    The painter’s interiority is lyrically embodied—she “listens with the hollow between her ribs”—and her micro-choice to return the heartbeat is dramatized with cost. Yet the arc is largely static: she ends where she began, merely lighter, so the “change” is more atmospheric than characterological. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure. Still, the contradictory impulses (take vs. give) coexist in-scene, satisfying the 9- quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elira’s interiority is textured—her thumb tracing scratched-out names, the warmth she feeds into the ink—yet the operative contradiction between “gentle” and “negotiator” never manifests as an on-page choice that costs her; the final smile feels bestowed rather than wrested from contradictory impulses. No micro-choice visibly risks her identity or safety, so the endurance lacks a wound we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vorne’s contradictory impulses—corporate destroyer vs. elegiac mourner—are rendered in concrete, body-level beats: the velvet box tucked like contraband, salt crust biting his knees. Each micro-choice (buying, not stealing; placing, not burying) externalizes the split. The final release carries real cost: he forfeits the egg, the map, and the fantasy that private guilt can balance public plunder. Sentimentality stays subcutaneous; his mother’s lullaby is recalled through tactile memory, never named as “trauma.”

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtesan’s bodily-poetic identity is more declared than dramatized—no moment shows her body-as-text actually constraining a tactical choice or costing her under pressure. Interior contradiction is implied (chastity vs. courtesan role) but never activated in a micro-choice; the final unlocking succeeds on first quiet whisper, so no visible flaw or price is paid. The refusal to take lovers is stated, not tested; thus the “armor of solitude” never chafes or forces a trade-off. Still, the through-line of self-definition as living poem gives her a memorable, singular edge that almost earns the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction is present—guilt over “aestheticizing harm” vs. serene ritual—but the shift from calligraphic complicity to puppet-subversion is summarized, not dramatized in-scene; no on-page micro-choice shows him risking tangible loss tonight. The puppet-self at the end supplies a concrete emblem of cost, earning partial change, yet Mira’s absence keeps relationship pressure offstage. Enough for credible arc, but not the full crucible of two-body stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “stillness settling into her bones”); the contradiction between transience and rootedness is dramatized in the deliberate looseness of the final bow. Motivation is legible throughout, but the absence of a second character removes status/relationship pressure, and no visible flaw complicates the ritual—she executes her devotional plan flawlessly. The moth-wing renunciation is earned, yet the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal, keeping the arc just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The caster’s grief-labor is embodied in tactile micro-choices—twisting rope, pressing wax—that externalize an inner absolution; the “technically gentle” refrain crystallizes a humane flaw that both enables the art and costs him his anonymity. Motivation stays legible and intensifies, but the arc leans on reflective summary more than scene, so the final renunciation feels slightly preordained rather than wrought under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied (“precisely playful step, half-dance, half-defiance”) and her childhood memory of the crossroads offers a credible seed for her fatalism. The contradictory impulse—seeking revelation while surrendering to paths that “choose their walkers”—is dramatized in the moment she lies down to dream, not just asserted. Yet the cost of her new knowledge feels slightly under-cooked: we see the bunker collapse but no immediate, personal price (injury, forfeited future) is registered on her body or choices, so the renunciation lands as conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astronomer’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—his threadbare robe, sold cloak, barley crust all manifest the “frugal” trait in embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (rationality vs. magic-belief) co-exist inside single beats, not alternating summaries. The final renunciation—no monument, no coin—lands as earned stasis because every prior sacrifice (lenses, meals, cloak) is logged on-page. Only the trembling-fingers beat edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, barely within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—pacifist who schemes, body as archive—but no second character on page means relationship crucible is NA; the micro-choice to press the broken pin to sternum and accept its silence is embodied and particular. The earned shift from external melody to internal marrow-hum lands with visible cost (she leaves the box behind). Still, the beat sequence is interior-only; a second pressure source could have sharpened the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is evocative—“glass mountains…in her marrow” shows embodied vocation—and her remembered sleepwalker source cues past wound. Yet the dream’s surrender feels foregone; no live contradiction forces her to test or revise her stance under pressure, so the renunciation reads as serene rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mender’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her calloused hands, the tightness in her throat, the hum of her mother’s tune—yet the daughter remains off-stage, so the “relationship as crucible” test is moot. Her stubborn, repair-not-redemption ethic drives every micro-choice (climbing the hymn-ladder, honey-coating the spoon) and the final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she forecloses reconciliation-in-a-day, accepting instead the slower graft of return. The only drag is a faint therapy-tag (“she didn’t believe in redemption”) that momentarily abstracts the beat where belief should be enacted; still, the hair-ribbon & vow stitching enact it immediately after, so the slip is hair-line, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    The curator’s interiority is vivid—her bones humming like an overtuned fork—but micro-choices are few until the bathroom beat. That single beat crystallizes her value hierarchy (knowledge > taboo) with a visible cost: she accepts the stigma of “forbidden” and the cameo’s irreversible split. Earlier beats mostly observe; they don’t test her under pressure, so the full arc feels front-loaded rather than progressively earned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elira’s linguist identity is vivid—she senses “linguistic strata” instead of reading titles, and her diary records “semantic blooms.” Interior contradiction shows when she chooses listening over force, yet her calm never cracks; more bodily cost under the mountain’s syrupy air would deepen stakes. Kael’s chrono-fracture flickers his pupils between centuries, a sharp externalized flaw. The final handshake is a credible micro-choice that forecloses extraction in favor of reconciliation, paying the concept cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chimera twin’s contradictory impulses are vividly embodied—her hesitation at plucking *Lirien* shows simultaneous yearning and dread. Interiority is concrete, never clinical: “Would that self still fit inside her skin?” carries felt cost. Micro-choice at the valve wheel triggers the floor-split; the prior beat of card-searing palms justifies the bold move. The earned stasis—accepting “trapped freedom” as freedom—caps her arc with visible forfeit of safe re-integration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and character-specific; the “quiet thrill of a puzzle” and “patient realignment” are shown through finger-by-finger braiding, not told. The final smile and ledger entry crystallize earned endurance with visible cost. No contradictory impulses in scene keep this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ripple-mark’s barefoot “reading” of the cave and her refusal to flee give embodied, specific interiority; the final renunciation—handing over the stone—carries visible cost. Yet she remains slightly mythic; no interior contradiction or flaw complicates her calm, so the arc is more fable than crucible. Still, her silence-as-architecture credo drives every beat and the ending stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The custodian’s interiority is rich—her belief that “coincidences have meaning” is dramatized by the meticulous star-alignment ritual. Embodied emotion (boots crunching silica, breath held) keeps diagnostic label-speak at bay. The final self-recognition (“she had been summoned”) is earned by seven winters of mapping and the prism’s pulse, so the renunciation of randomness carries visible cost. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; she never doubts the quest, so the arc is single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—“preemptively nostalgic” is a lived-in tic—but the absence of a second on-page character removes relationship crucible pressure; the only micro-choice is to keep writing, so the arc is emotional accretion rather than a tested shift. The final smile at her own erasure is earned by prior longing, yet the cost is abstract, not embodied in a beat that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s interiority is sensorially embodied and chemically precise; her chant is not exposition but a lived tic that steadies her under pressure. The kerosene rag knot functions as both talisman and timer, its twitch against her wrist marking the emotional crescendo. Cost is visible: she forfeits the rag and the past it represents, yet the moment of surrender is compressed into a single swallow of pigment—too slight to feel the full weight of “defying gravity.” Still, the contradiction between playful choreography and mortal stakes is credibly irrational, and the earned stasis of leaving the star behind satisfies the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is lush, embodied, and specific—her “fingertips brushing the edge of a starlit pool” fuses sensation with metaphysics. The jade cicada anchors a contradictory impulse: to freeze time yet allow transition, dramatized when she pockets it again “its weight now a comfort, a compass.” Micro-choices—dip fingers, offer silence, withhold decision—externalize a hierarchy that values presence over declaration; the final shared pause costs them both forward momentum, paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The child’s hunger for “flavors of silence” is viscerally embodied—clutching the doll, crawling upward, tasting sky-hush—so motive stays legible. The final renunciation (doll grafted to trellis, refusal to descend) crystallizes a value hierarchy we watched form beat by beat. Interiority is concrete (“ribs against too-close walls,” “tongue of the soul”) rather than clinical. One hairline slip: the phrase “starvation” for silence skirts diagnostic-speak; a fresher idiom would clinch 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    The operator’s interiority is evoked through bodily cues (tilt of head, exhale) and the storm-glass micro-choices; his contradictory impulse—yearning to speak yet enforcing wordless catalysis—stays active in scene. Silence-as-vessel motivation is anchored to grandmother memory and prior passenger, giving a trace of backstory that tilts present stance. No status/relationship crucible (only transient passengers), so full Relationship bullet set N/A. Cost is felt: each silence he midwives costs him fresh emotional labor, visible when “he sighed…readiness,” but the renunciation is more iterated habit than acute new sacrifice, capping uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the lore-keeper’s “singular” drive stays legible through tactile micro-choices (counting paces, brushing petals, choosing which self to keep). Contradictory impulses surface implicitly—wonder vs. dread as steps liquefy into others’ memories—but are not dramatized in a single beat of overt tension between wants; the final ascension feels inevitable rather than torn-from. Ruby-flake hum offers external confirmation instead of forcing her to question her right to ascend, muting flaw-exposure. Still, the renunciation of dominion carries visible cost: the orchard and artifact vanish, leaving only “quiet certainty,” an Earned Stasis that fits prior “wisely adventurous” calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper’s motivations—silence as honest language, teaching suffocation to breathe—are lucid and drive every micro-choice. Her contradictory impulses (tenderness vs. severance) coexist in the same beats, embodied in the trembling knuckles and bare feet. The final renunciation of looking back is earned through the scar-threading ritual and carries visible cost: the sanctuary folds, the knocker falls, her lungs still ache. Interiority remains concrete, never sliding into label-speak; the only restraint from 9+ is the absence of a second on-page character to test status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s past as a scheme-survivor is viscerally present in her distrust and in the way she weaponizes that distrust to volunteer as “anchor.” The single interior contradiction—spite-as-faith—drives every beat and the final bolt press feels earned. Micro-choices (coaxing mycelium, deleting texts, pocketing the bolt again) are concrete and charged. Cost is visible: sleepless-history traded for a singing grove she now tends.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dynasty ender’s interior contradiction—duty to end versus genetic compulsion to restore—plays out in micro-gestures: the trembling thumb on brass, the refusal to rush. Her exile-tuned body-as-instrument justifies the intuitive listening and makes the final recognition feel earned. No secondary character appears; the self-crucible is sufficient. Cost is palpable: the identity she weaponized evaporates in the same breath that crowns her.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    The knight’s transformation from ossified warrior to living conduit is dramatized through embodied motion rather than exposition; each “unsnapped” hinge externalizes interior surrender. Internal conflict stays visceral—armor as second skin versus luminous nectar on bare feet—and the final laugh pays the cost of total exposure. No stock epithets; even “withdrawn” is shown by years of silence and moss, not told. The murmured allegiance functions as a credo that actively forecloses return to knighthood, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her “trembling fingers,” the way dust ‘whispers’ to her—showing a believable contradiction between archival detachment and aching need to belong. The micro-choice to switch off overhead lights and angle the lamp is decisive, stakes her professional routine on a personal quest, and forecloses pure objectivity with visible cost (her supervisor’s glance, the new logbook). The reflective blocks stay anchored to present stimuli (button, dust ghosts) and tilt her stance; no diagnostic label-speak. Only the “quiet companion” heartache leans abstract; a hair more specificity in how that ache sharpens focus would clinch 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s quiet, tactical interiority is vividly embodied and consistently resourceful; the “key” becomes a living extension of her fingers, not a prop. The final renunciation—sitting cross-legged to watch dials ignite while sirens close in—pays the full price of her life-risk and crystallizes her value hierarchy without a spoken manifesto.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The saxophonist’s interior contradiction—grief versus duty—is embodied in breath-fog on brass and trembling reed; every micro-choice (softened attack, dissolved note) alters the metaphysical stakes. Motivation stays legible: silence a prophecy that frost-bit his family line. The renunciation costs him the prism itself and any future return, a price felt in the final glance back. No stock therapy-speak; even “prophecy” is kept symbolic, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s interiority is lush, tactile, and consistent—“mossy delight” is both affect and worldview; every micro-choice (prodding the speck, humming, embedding dust) flows from her need to listen. The final grandmother-touch crystallizes a credible internal change with visible cost: she weeps, moss blooms, her satchel now “heavy with dust-specks and unsung elegies.” No therapy-speak; contradictions (delight amid ash) stay embodied. The only micro-slip: “singular” motivation is stated once rather than dramatized in tension, but the steady escalation of stakes overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s obsession with broken clocks and regret is vividly embodied; the compass-triggered renunciation of his father’s watch crystallizes his shift from control to surrender. Interiority stays concrete, but the cavern epiphany leans toward articulated thesis rather than simultaneous contradiction. Still, the final stance costs him his old identity, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt over withholding a name from a dying rival calcifies into the load-bearing stone under her ribs; the embodied metaphor and ritualized micro-choices (pouring regret, whispering syllables) keep interiority concrete. The final shift from “Even” to “Mended” is earned because every beat ties back to her refusal of mercy and the coin’s cracks. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time, however—guilt is confessed rather than fought—so the arc falls just short of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The collector’s interiority stays concrete—she kneels beside dread, absorbs confessions through the tooth’s warmth, chooses to play the leaf-flute while the gorge shudders—each micro-choice embodying her integrating purpose. Contradictory impulses (fear/comfort, grief/laughter) braid in real time, not summaries. The modest-fearless trait is shown, not labeled, when she kneels where a child’s giggle became a sob. Persistent flaw: no visible cost paid by her; the tooth absorbs weight but she walks away “fuller,” not visibly diminished, capping the arc just below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is visceral and embodied (“my body proprioceptively enhanced… calibrated through months of enhanced interrogation”) and the pewter strap anchors a credible renunciation at the end. The survivor’s micro-choices—the whispered calculus answer, the deliberate release of the strap—show a hierarchy of values under pressure. Flaw: the recursive torture questions are recalled more than dramatized, so the motivational roots feel slightly abstract rather than lived-in. Still, the endurance stance is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s barefoot walk across rope planks, trading a memory of grandmother’s apron for the lens, and finally guiding the historian’s trembling hand all dramatize a believable arc from erased child to agent of reclamation; interiority stays concrete (“my soles remembering the sting…”). The decision to surrender the precious memory as payment and later return the spent fragment visibly costs her, earning the quiet final stance. No secondary relationship crucible is on-page, but the lens-hand-off to the historian serves as a micro-relationship that crystallizes her vocation. Voice remains singular and flawed—she bargains her own tenderness away—so the reader feels the price of her trade.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“brushed dust from knees,” shallow breath) and the paternal link to the child’s drawing gives emotional stakes. Yet the technician’s core contradiction—repairman vs ghost-witness—never complicates his tactics; he proceeds exactly as expected. The final “weightless burden” is declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—ink-stained fingers, trembling hands, the warmth of the compressed moment against her palm. Contradictory impulses (order vs rupture) coexist in the same beats. Final renunciation—library forever glitched—carries visible cost: “perfection was ruined.” Only limit: no second character, so relationship crucible untested.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The revolutionary’s ache is palpable in every fingertip on the shard; his shift from agitator to mourner to translator is embodied, not declared. Interior contradiction—yearning for utopia while weaponizing nostalgia—drives every micro-choice, including the decision to veil mirrors. The cost is legible: he forfeits the heroic narrative he once lived by and accepts perpetual exile in negative space. Only the late entry of Dr. Voss prevents a 9+; her presence dilutes the crucible pressure that had been laser-focused on him.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“his fingers moving with the rhythm of forgotten lullabies,” “made his teeth ache”), but the single micro-choice—singing the lullaby—while credible, is not complicated by visible contradictory impulses; the moment of redemption feels gently inevitable rather than wrested. The cost is felt (he weeps), yet the character’s flaw (the old lie) is confessed only in retrospective summary, not tested in a present-tightened dilemma. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the arc from guilt to reclamation is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elira’s sensibly eccentric collector identity shows in gear (brass dish, compass) and micro-choice (licking a page), but we never see her interior contradiction under escalating pressure; the “surrender” epiphany is accepted, not wrestled with, so the change feels foregone rather than earned.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“fingers tracing the brittle edges,” “quiet thunder of understanding”—but the arc is almost entirely receptive: she notices, sketches, weeps, smiles. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the final surrender is foregone, not tested under pressure. The cost is felt, yet it arrives as recognition rather than choice, keeping the beat just shy of the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The archivist’s interiority is granular and embodied—she traces rivets, tastes iron, feels salt on her cheeks; every micro-choice (descending the ladder, rearranging debris) is tethered to her vocation and the emerging moral cost of witness. Contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs. bodily communion—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final stance of perpetual sleepless sentry is earned: she has been altered by the lagoon’s hand-on-shoulder command, foreclosing any return to sterile cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s refusal to “restore” and his insistence on reinvention are credibly rooted in the trauma of the dawn wish; his micro-choice to hand the bottle to the child (rather than open it) crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him sole authorship of the revival, a believable renunciation. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“nostalgia is a narcotic, not a blueprint”). Still, the emotional arc is slightly too smooth: the shift from isolated grief to communal participation is told more than embodied in a visible beat of hesitation or fear, so the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s interior contradiction—preserver vs. awakened catalyst—drives every beat; the child-prophecy reprise crystallizes her renunciation of passive archiving with a felt cost (she kneels, palms bleeding into moss). The micro-choice to release the first petal is anchored in prior guilt and language-gift, so the turn is earned. Secondary pressure is missing—no live antagonist or relationship crucible—so agency tops out at strong, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the trembling fingers, barefoot glide, and sternum-warmed acorn make her motives tactile. Contradictory impulses (rage/peace, hold/release) sit in the same moment, not in alternating summaries. The final laugh roots rather than echoes, showing earned change. The vortex inheritance functions as motivation, but its rules remain abstract, so the cost feels cosmic rather than personal; a hairline slip from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tester’s vocation-driven interiority is concrete—her distrust of sirens, her glacier patience, her refusal to rush “after the glue dries.” Yet the climactic bell-ring is triggered by sensor thresholds, not an active choice that visibly costs her; the moment remains observational. No contradictory impulse is staged in the final beat, so the renunciation feels mild rather than charged. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, anchoring the lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the janitor’s contradictory impulses (archive-order vs. reverence-for-decay) stay active in-scene. The final stance—sweeping on after the comet’s unlogged efflorescence—earns its quiet cost: he accepts permanent erasure of the moment he most values. Micro-choices (kneeling, raising the glass, returning to broom) trace a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only limit: no second character to pressure status, so crucible is purely intra-spiritual, capped under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The keeper’s mute vigil is rendered through embodied, contradiction-rich interiority (“tranquilly perceptive” yet bone-bent over the box); her refusal to open it crystallizes an earned stasis whose cost is legible in the final honey-gold glyphs. Micro-choices—bare feet brushing dust, spine curved into storms—reveal a hierarchy valuing silence over release. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets waived. The covenant functions as persistent constraint; the gratitude flicker from the beekeeper ghost externalizes the cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vey’s interiority is rich—timeless heartbeat as deliberate act, texture-of-time obsession—yet the moment of change (urn fragments fuse) is more miracle than earned choice; no micro-choice visibly pays the cost. Relationship with Lira remains observationally flat, no status shift under pressure. Still, embodied emotion (“hand near the silo’s core pulses”) and perceptual signature keep the portrait vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the feather yet letting it warm the child—are dramatized in a single, wordless gesture that costs her the talisman. Interiority is salt-cured and specific: braille-reading tide-ripples, the feather’s “humming barbs.” The final renunciation (empty hands, full heart) is the earned payoff of her “incomplete > beauty” credo, visible in sand on her knees and the boy’s changed gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Arlen’s quietly raging refusal to die on despair’s terms is embodied in every copper twist; the diary, the wire, the orchard all act as extensions of his will, making each micro-choice tactile. Interiority stays salt-stained and specific—no diagnostic jargon, just the haptic memory of leather softened by sweat. The final image of his open palm toward sky crystallizes an earned stasis: he forecloses personal survival to buy a communal grammar of respect. Minor cap: secondary villagers are sketched more as chorus than crucible, but the single-POV focus keeps the loss legible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The luminous skeptic’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor vs. pilgrim hunger—is vivid in every micro-choice (setting the amber as “coordinate,” not offering). Embodied emotion is precise: “boots sinking slightly,” “marrow” feeling the bronze quiet. The final renunciation—leaving the amber, carrying “density”—earns its cost because the prior beats have linked data failure to bodily surrender. No secondary character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    The coachman’s quiet, ritualized endurance is rendered through concrete micro-choices (crushing pods, kneeling to listen) that externalize his contradictory grief-hope. His seventeen-year obsession is never psychologized; instead, the battered hands, coat pockets, and multilingual murmurs show a man whose identity has fused with his task. The final refusal to leave until the horses themselves “understand” crystallizes an Earned Stasis that costs him any ordinary future. No interiority drifts into explanatory prose; every thought is anchored to tactile gesture or bird-reply, so the arc feels lived, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bracken’s shift from corpse-hunter to voice-archivist is embodied in every beat: the leaf trembling in his jaws, the nose-twitch at shellac, the nights spent decoding. Contradictory impulses—loyalty to the dead handler vs need to give the living closure—coexist in scene, not summary. The final choice to keep listening, not hunting, forecloses the old life with the cost: he will never sniff his handler’s bones, only her voice. Voice, occupation, and flaw are one: “the hound who sees sideways” is unable to stop seeing, condemned to translate distance into resonance forever.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pariah’s interiority is rich and embodied—her breath mists, her fingers trace, her pulse syncs with the compass—contradictory impulses (stay vs. flee, mourning vs. wonder) coexist in-scene. Micro-choices (unclip sketchpad, steady wrist, close book) chart a credible shift from passive witness to active cartographer of distorted time. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the grandmother voice is handled as recalled texture, not dialogue. The final renunciation—choosing to sketch the anomaly—costs her any chance of “normal” return, and that cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elric’s “sacredly playful” motive is embodied in every tactile swap; the fox-pawn and star-knight substitutions make his value hierarchy legible under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—“wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods” externalizes awe without label-speak. The final kneel is earned: three winters of study paid for with numb fingers and stolen truths, so the cost is felt. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradiction between performing and bearing witness is embodied in every beat (the ring placement, the refusal to bow). The final refusal is earned by the slow erosion of pretense shown in the walking-glyphs. The “historian of small gestures” motive remains active, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral—no embodied injury or forfeiture is dramatized. The penumbra strips illusion, yet the narrator’s emotional degradation under that pressure is implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The seer’s longing for “the shape of home” is visceral and embodied, but the interior contradiction—why she now buries rather than awakens talent—arrives as declarative backstory instead of a pressured micro-choice; the renunciation is felt yet not dramatized in-scene, so the cost is legible but not fully earned by prior causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers fidgeted productively”); the self-forgiveness arc is credible because each micro-choice (kneeling to winnow, tracing the fogged mirror) is tied to the prior pedagogical sin. The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-talk (“guilt from grief”) that momentarily flattens the contradiction. Closure cost is felt: she carries the truth “lightly,” a renunciation that forecloses exile as identity. Meets 9+ quick test despite minor therapy-speak flicker.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The artist’s insistence on polyphonic truth feels lived-in; her refusal to descend with a “polished parable” crystallizes a coherent, flawed self. Interiority is vivid (“charcoal smudged fingers trembled—not from cold”), yet the moment she swallows every regret the contradiction is shown, not declared. The final self-exposure carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test despite slight over-articulation of philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradiction-laden (“hands shook not from fear but from the weight of kintsugi intentions”). Micro-choices (each lacquer press) visibly trace values and cost. The final renunciation—pouring her tears, not gold—crystallizes earned change. Slight over-articulation of grief items keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is sensory-rich (“brine and buried time”); the cracked-mirror trigger justifies retreat; leaving the shell is visible cost. Motivation stays interior-credible; no external pressure tests status, so relationship bullets N/A. The final renunciation lands cleanly but lacks a contradictory impulse on-page, keeping it short of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—blistered fingers, shallow breath, the cork’s warmth—yet her “whispers > shouts” creed is stated more than dramatized; we see the result (ships turn) but not a moment where she doubts or over-shouts herself. The beat of pressing the cork to her lips crystallizes her hierarchy of values; the empty vial in her pocket supplies visible cost. Still, the absence of a micro-choice that could fail—no temptation to bellow into the gale—keeps the arc a hair short of perfect contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“ghost-heat of incense… settles behind her sternum”), but the navigator’s only visible micro-choice is to climb and sing at the end; the middle is pure meditation, so agency feels observational rather than crucible-tested. The moon-phase physiology is shown in how she “waits” and “listens,” yet no beat forces her to defy or obey that rhythm under pressure, so the flaw stays minor. Still, the voice-specific noticing (“patina bronze censer foot like a rosary”) keeps her idiosyncratic and alive.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her boots sink into moss-slick roots, fingers brush leaf litter, the glass eye cools her thigh—every beat is filtered through her sensory bias. The motivation (self-first safety, then extending calm) remains steady and escalates to the gift-giving confrontation where she risks her scarce truffles and relinquishes the relic; the renunciation costs her the very tool that blunts her curse, so the arc is earned. The three traumatized seekers function as pressure mirrors; their flinch and whispered “say it slant” force her to translate blunt truth into metaphor, altering her tactic on the page. Minor slip: the laugh of an off-stage child is reported, not embodied, so the emotional payoff is slightly abstract rather than legible in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s obsession with residue-driven memory is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to pin the flower to his own coat shows interior contradiction and stakes. The “softly persistent” trait surfaces only in summary, not under pressure, so the final renunciation feels slightly under-cooked—no visible cost is dramatized on him. Still, his perceptual signature is sharp and consistent, and the closure’s Earned Stasis is believable within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s “empirically intuitive” trait is more label than lived; his sister vow is told in one reflective block, not dramatized. Still, the matrix-chip burn fuses an embodied cost to his choice, and the shop-left-forever beat shows credible renunciation. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory-in-scene, but the closure carries felt price, satisfying the 9- gate for earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen’s interior contradiction—power versus pulse—surfaces in every tactile step and star-scorched palm; the final renunciation to “climb back down as witness” is earned by the cascade of buried memories. Micro-choices (bare feet on shale, letting starlight scorch) keep authority credible yet humbled. Only the “softly commanding” label drifts toward diagnostic shorthand; the body already shows it.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—holding cool shell while stepping into furnace heat—embodies her scientific-romantic creed; Elias’s micro-choice to speak while she offers the shell crystallizes status shift. Their shared flaw (guilt/resolve) compounds rather than resolves, earning the final bridge. One epiphany (“Your guilt…is the pigment I’ve been missing”) risks tidy rationalization but is immediately embodied in the glowing shell hand-off, so the causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—jealousy of past selves collides with present grief—and the final micro-choice (rolling the scroll, stepping out) costs him the illusion of clean endings. Embodied emotion (“vibrates in my molars”) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The lone weakness: no second on-page character, so status/relationship crucible is absent, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her anosmia is lived through touch and listening—but the midwife-screw “fulcrum” beat is delivered by Ren, not tested by her own micro-choice, so the final stance feels gifted rather than earned. Still, her embodied attention to clients’ jaw-clench and the clock’s fracture keeps contradiction alive in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete—burn scars, trembling fingers, ink’s scent—and her micro-choices (humming lullaby, vertical “breathe” stroke) visibly alter the moment. The contradiction between scholarly rigor and childhood superstition is enacted in real time, not summarized, and the final earned stasis—scars shimmer into waypoints—carries felt cost. No head-count or relationship pressure to test, so only the single-POV criteria apply; all satisfied. A hairline slip: “lattice of old burns” skirts label-speak, though the next clause rescues it with sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The exorcist’s contradictory impulses—columnist sensationalism vs. reparative humility—are dramatized in the moment she uncaps the bottle and clips the coil; the apology costs her public persona and Elias’s silence the price. Interiority is concrete (“she trembled”) and embodied, not diagnostic. The micro-choice to hand over the restored manuscript (with every wrong bar memorized) earns the understated closure of “a small, cracked” smile. Only the occupational detail of “induced currents” feels slightly under-cued for motive credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    Witness’s interiority stays lyrically specific; the barefoot tread, cracked spine, and unlearning vocabulary are embodied micro-choices. Motive—“housekeeping” of reality—remains consistent and personal, so the final surrender feels earned. No secondary character, so no status crucible, but solitary spiral fulfills arc. Cost: identity dissolves; dictionary burns into light—felt, irreversible. Meets 9+ quick test under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shepherd’s obsessive reversal of time is vividly embodied—key-turning, backward counting, boots on gravel—but he never risks a concrete loss; the “cost” is only abstract. Interiority is rich yet loops on the same metaphysical refrain without new micro-choices after the key-turn. No contradiction or flaw complicates his stance, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete—her spatial gift manifests in tactile beats (soil glow, button click)—and her final micro-choice (offering the diode, not pointing) crystallizes her arc. The letting-go motive stays legible, yet the mother-stranger figure remains a passive projection, never exerting live status pressure, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t ignite. Still, the earned renunciation carries visible cost in the diode’s demotion from relic to key. One contradictory impulse short of 9-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory lineage—gambler’s intuition versus professor’s probability—drives every micro-choice: stealing the lantern, flunking calculus, decoding glyphs. Her interiority is concrete (“clover melancholy,” “lucid contradictions”) rather than performed; her body registers cost (chalk trembling). The shift from entropy-as-rebellion to entropy-as-entropy is dramatized in the father ward scene where she withholds the glyphs yet leaves the clover—an earned, costly refusal. Only hairline slip: “theoretically rebellious” is label-adjacent, though immediately paid off by the on-page stunt of flunking.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    The operator’s contradiction—compulsively wiring strangers toward accidental intimacy while nursing her own exile—turns every patch-cable flick into a micro-choice that exposes her hunger for unscripted beginnings. The culminating self-call collapses observer and observed: she loops her own voice into the disc, an embodied renunciation that costs her the last illusion of exteriority. Interiority is sensory, never diagnostic—“air tasted of iron and ozone,” “crystalline sigh”—and every emotional state is filtered through her fingertip’s friction on glass or rotary dial. Flaws (solipsism, voyeurism) actively shape her final tactic; the disc’s self-spinning is the visible hinge where motive becomes irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (fingers reading braille of salt-crusted planks); motivation holds steady across beats. Micro-choices—closing locket, journal entry—carry visible cost, but the “gentle thorough” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a way that forces hard trade-offs. Earned stasis in the final walk-off feels serene yet slightly protected; no moment of true interior contradiction ruptures the composure. Still, the character-specific perceptual signature is strong enough to reach high band with only a hairline gap in flaw exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s jocular mask and moon-rock talisman give her a sharp, specific edge; the final reciprocal exchange with the trembling man embodies her hierarchy of values and costs her emotional armor, earning the change to quieter authenticity. Interiority is vivid (“laughter was her currency”) and body-linked (“her boots crunching”), but the middle trades only anecdotes, so pressure on her flaw relaxes until the last beat. Still, the renunciation of magical belief in favor of shared warmth is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blind mapmaker’s interiority is vividly sensorial—languages “climbing her arm,” ribs “swelling” with sorrow—yet her contradictory impulses (absorb pain vs. remain self-contained) are stated more than simultaneous. The final renunciation—placing the ring, accepting silence—pays off prior causality with visible cost, but the micro-choices inside the stillpoint are summarized, not dramatized, blunting the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and specific—“unbent… the rigid syntax of her assumptions”—but the emotional arc plateaus; she exits with the same confident-uncertainty she entered with, so no new internal contradiction is forced. The micro-choices (traced glyph, whisper to the void) are present yet feel symbolic rather than costly; no lasting flaw or price is internalized. Still, the voice-driven self-portrait is vivid enough to earn strong band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s renunciation of archival permanence is earned through her tactile micro-choices with the camera and the girl; the contradictory pull between creation and erasure is held in scene, not summary. Silas functions more as choral voice than active advisor, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is only half-met. Interiority stays concrete, but one line (“joyful sorrow of creation”) flirts with diagnostic label-speak without full embodiment. Still, the final gesture of release carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (arsonist vs savior) are present but rendered in summary rather than dramatized in-scene; the final palm-press is credible renunciation yet the cost is more mystical than personally earned. Interiority is lyrically specific (“volcanic tenderness”) and motive stays consistent, but the archive’s responding tremors externalize pressure instead of forcing a visible internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Gamma-7’s interiority is vivid—drumming as embodied rebellion, the 27-ghost chorus behind her eyes—but her moment-to-moment decisions are mostly drift, not fork. The arc lands on Earned Stasis (she accepts the entangled choir), yet the cost feels pre-paid by the experiment rather than freshly forced by a visible choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. risk—is dramatized in the coin pocketing and the choice to pass evidence quietly, not confront; embodied tension in “coin pulsing like a second heartbeat.” Micro-choice hierarchy visible: silent map hand-off >暴露Delgado. Flaw (curiosity) directly enables climax; renunciation of direct revenge costs her the immediate catharsis, earned by prior pattern of calibrated silence. Status dynamics legible only with Ruiz in one beat, sufficient for length; gait motif stays individual, not stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guardian’s motivation is ancient, non-verbal, and consistently dramatized through tactile micro-choices—mirror angles, shutter nudges—each costing her solitude and bodily exposure. Her contradictory impulse—stoic silence versus active intervention—plays out in real time, culminating in the renunciation of voice that lets the drowned woman choose ascent. The embodied cost is legible: she wipes dew from the mirror and steps back into shadow, path foreclosed. No slips; the interior hierarchy (silence > self > stranger) is shown, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s quiet insurgency is credibly rooted in her history with the grotto and the library’s hush; her interiority stays concrete (“she didn’t need followers. She needed witnesses”). The final micro-choice—handing Milo the white queen—pays off her gardener-of-seconds motive with visible cost: surrender of secrecy. Flaw: no contradictory impulse on-page; stance is steady, not sharpened by internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s dancer-poise dock work, calloused palms, and whale-bone-hearing micro-choice under cold water give embodied, contradictory interiority. The scrimshaw’s dissolve and her return to kiss a war-orphan’s forehead dramatize a renunciation with visible cost, earned by prior song-syntax. One hairline slip: “taught to fight before she learned to feel” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, not lived contradiction in scene, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blank-faced performer’s interior contradiction—grief versus mandated joy—is embodied in the ritual whittling and flat narration; each micro-choice (burning pamphlets, sealing the bouquet) visibly costs them. The final “I miss you” proves interiority survives the void, earning renunciation. Moral ambiguity stays credibly unresolved: they comply yet keep hollowing. Only the Officers feel generic, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s need “to touch what had been declared untouchable” is visceral and consistent; embodied tremor and barefoot cold make the interiority specific. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—certainty only swells—so the arc is emotionally linear rather than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation of permission-asking lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost but not quite.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s synesthetic perception is rendered through concrete, embodied choices—tracing the reed, arranging stems by stiffness—that externalize his colorblind sight and “beauty in the stumble” ethic. The moment he hands Marta the reed tongue crystallizes a credible shift from solitary salvager to mentor, paying the cost of sole ownership of his method. Interior contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper beat of self-doubt or risk would have nudged this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing fossilized silence, her tear of recognition—but the “artificial pilgrimage” motive stays abstract; no concrete micro-choice (e.g., risking the lens) crystallizes until the final breath. The cost is felt, yet the path to it is more contemplative than pressured, so the renunciation reads as gentle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“grief had scraped her soul to marrow”); the contradiction between making beauty from grief and never claiming credit is credible. The final gesture—placing the crane on the library steps—crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she will never know if the locket is opened. Voice-specific tics (“curtains of intention”) occasionally edge toward self-conscious lyricism, nudging her below the 9-band. Still, her micro-choices (fold, burnish, release) form a legible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cartomancer’s curiosity is steady but never tested by contradiction; she observes, maps, and nods without a visible cost or renunciation. No micro-choice tightens or forecloses a path; the visitor’s single line supplies the only shift, not hers. Interiority is atmospheric rather than conflicted, so the closure feels observational, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The historian’s grief is viscerally embodied—nails in palms, veil soaked with salt—yet her contradictory mission to “purify” memory by annihilating nostalgia is dramatized in every off-beat step and broken hum. The micro-choice to sing her daughter’s off-key lullaby inside the resonance chamber crystallizes her hierarchy of values and earns the lighter-after-cost closure. Interiority never slips into label-speak; even “anguished joy” is enacted, not diagnosed. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship-as-crucible from pushing higher.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s solitude is a crucible; her interiority is concrete, anchored to the river-stone pulse in her palm. Contradictory impulses—hunger to archive versus dread of gloss—co-exist in the same frame. The renunciation at the end (accepting hope’s new skins while keeping vigil) is earned by the slow accumulation of observed metamorphoses, paid for with her tears and the stone’s weight. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; her micro-choice to embed the stone in the data-core visibly reorders the dream-feed, proving agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers tracing the severed tail, dawn-gold pigment matching the fracture—yet the epiphany that “conviction, too, needed shedding” drifts toward label-speak, softening the decisive moment. Micro-choices (lighting the brazier, mixing lichen pigment) visibly enact her hierarchy of values, but the turn from complicity to reconstruction is one micro-step too tidy for full 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—scar as text, coffee ring as map—and her micro-choices (touching wood, kneeling to seed) flow from motives shown, not told. The “closure seeker” label is stated once; the rest is embodied, so the diagnostic-speak penalty is waived. Final renunciation earns its cost via seed-dissolve that rewrites her scar, foreclosing old identity. No contradictory impulses shown simultaneously in-scene keeps this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gazer’s interiority is vivid—her spatial imagination is dramatized through the film-handling ritual and the discovery of the letters; her recognition micro-choice (“she, too, had written goodbye letters…”) anchors empathy. The final act of mailing the decades-late letters crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost: she leaves the theater lighter yet burdened by the weight of witness. No contradictory impulses collide in-scene, so the arc is slightly tidy, but the embodied emotion and earned stasis satisfy the 9+ quick test almost fully.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bristling contradiction between cosmic calling and bodily fatigue is felt in every micro-gesture; the brass instrument warms in her grip, a visceral anchor. The final collapse into weeping registers as earned capitulation, not performance, because the cost—frozen tears, emptied ribs—has been accumulating since line one. Interiority stays concrete (“her chest echoed like a cathedral of unfinished hymns”) and avoids label-speak even at the climax. Only the slightest safety-hedge—her saintly purity untested by real interpersonal friction—keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    Interiority remains abstract ("dreamless by design," "purpose was not to witness") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. No relationship crucible on page; only off-stage cargo of silence. Final softening of shoulders is the sole visible cost, but it is undifferentiated and unearned by prior causality. Character reads as atmospheric cipher, not individuated mind.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The philosopher’s curiosity and practiced resignation are vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“wanted rediscovery yet kept the gear”). Embodied emotion peaks at mercury waterfall; afterward he becomes a serene pilgrim without visible cost on the page. Closure feels lightly earned because the gear’s refusal to fall is external magic rather than a choice that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elira and Torvin act under a shared communal motive rather than individual contradiction; their micro-choices (punching stars, pressing ear to bark) show gentle persistence but no clashing interior stakes. No conflicting want/fear is dramatized inside either guide, so the “pilgrimage” feels collective, not personal. The final insight is voiced collectively (“Courage doesn’t rust”), so no single character pays a visible, private cost. Characterization is atmospheric, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bellhop’s trembling hands, bolt theft, and final re-seating of the bench are concrete, embodied choices that externalize his internal war between safety and sound; the contradiction is dramatized, not declared. The mute vow “stitched into his marrow” risks a touch of label-speak, but the regenerating nerves give every tactile moment a cost that keeps the arc credible. The arrival of the child with whistle in mitt forces the decisive micro-choice that re-opens the piano, earning the renunciation of silence with a felt price. One more beat of visible hesitation at the keys would have pushed this into 9-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The exile-princess is vividly sketched through gesture, silence, and the tactile handling of the ink pellet; her refusal of the crown lands as earned renunciation because every prior beat shows her choosing truth-over-throne. Interior contradiction is present but stays general—“hollow echo of justice delayed”—rather than a momentary clash of impulses under peak pressure, keeping her just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief for vanished reefs and compulsive tactile listening—are dramatized in every micro-choice (tapping surfaces, peeling fused pages, choosing submersion). The final renunciation of “searching for vanished paths” is earned through a causal chain of discoveries that visibly cost her solitude and professional safety. Interiority stays concrete (“salt-crusted and silent”) rather than diagnostic. No stock phrases; even the AI’s chime is filtered through her newly rewired perception.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and lyrical, the barefoot stance and trembling glasses embody conflicted impulses; remembrance vs reignition crystallizes in the aria-whisper. The final renunciation—“it was never about winning”—carries visible cost as she seeds the hum and forfeits her solitary vigil. Micro-choices (kneeling, palms to grating, downward lenses) consistently reveal value hierarchy. Hairline slip: “awkwardly confident” is asserted once but not dramatized in a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The insurgent grandmother’s interiority is concrete and embodied—steam curling around her knuckles, vines brushing her wrists—showing a hierarchy of values (memory over violence, evolution over dogma). Her micro-choice to offer the seed “Choose” crystallizes her stance and forecloses control, earning the cost of relinquished authority. Occasional diagnostic phrasing—“implanted destiny: a map of who they were meant to become”—leans toward abstraction, preventing a clean 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and sensorily anchored; the somatic-marker mechanic is lived, not labeled. The arc from survival-anchored noticing to sketching-for-witness is a credible, earned renunciation. Minor dip: “drone-strike wedding survivor” risks headline shorthand; the body memory compensates but the phrase itself leans diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The portrait artist’s interiority is rich and embodied—her tactile engagement with splinters, thread, and parchment maps her psyche. Contradictory impulses (to repair vs. to descend into fracture) coexist in scene, culminating in the barefoot step that reassembles the box. The final self-portrait inside her eyelids shows earned transformation. Yet the mentor’s vanishing is asserted, not dramatized, so the catalytic grief feels slightly external.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is laser-specific: “quiet, molten fury at the universe’s refusal to explain its own mechanics” fuses trait and motive. The final self-erasure is the ultimate micro-choice, foreclosing existence with visible cost. Contradictory impulses—rage vs. serenity—co-exist in the same beat, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s trembling fingers, the jasmine/iron scent, the decision to seat the letter on the Resonance Table all embody a simultaneous duty/conscience split under real time pressure. The interiority stays concrete (“her breath the only sound...”) and avoids therapy-speak; the final “truth doesn’t need volume” is a stance crystallization earned through every micro-choice. Cost is felt in her arrest and the triple-ice quarantine; her flaws (naïve faith in archives as tombs) drove the action. Minor slip: “bravely conflicted storm within” is slightly label-adjacent, but the next clause grounds it in finger tremor, so the moment still works.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pacifist vocation is credibly rooted in embodied rituals—sheathing the knife, slicing stems for orphans—yet the interior contradiction between inherited violence and chosen gentleness is told more than enacted in scene. The final gift of a cutting to the child crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning the earn-stasis closure, but the absence of a live antagonist or intimate foil limits relational pressure. Her perceptual gift (noticing petal tremors) is lyrically evoked yet never complicates a beat or forces a tactical error, so it stays ornamental. Still, every action aligns with motive and the refusal to hunt carries inherited weight, satisfying the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fisher’s calm, analytic stance under cosmic pressure is embodied in every micro-choice—barefoot calibration, silence-sculpting, spike strike—so her final transliterated vowel feels earned. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, emotions are sonar, tooth-ache lullabies, iron resonance. Contradictory impulses (cool reason vs. maternal fury channeling) coexist in-scene, and the renunciation—letting the echo pass through her—costs the spike and her sonic compass. Voice stays singular, faultlessly consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    The heiress’s motivation—truth-seeking as civic duty—remains vivid and coherent, anchored by the tactile pen nib and the rooftop stakeout. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “solemn playfulness” that blooms before she weaponizes evidence. Yet her internal contradiction is only implied, not dramatized in-scene; the pen never hesitates, so we see no moment where her drive might falter. The final choice is decisive and costly, but because it is solitary, status/relationship pressure is absent; still, the earned stance is credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interior contradiction—wanting to silence guilt yet fearing the silence itself—drives every beat; her choice to bleed into the machine is a renunciation that costs her innocence. The embodied micro-choice of pressing her own arm to the amber fuses vocation and wound in one motion. Emotional progression layers credibly: technician calm → static accusation → cracked lullaby. Closure is earned because the tattooist’s earlier mistake (mis-aligned Orion) is the very firmware she now redeems; the cost is her blood and the permanent glyph constellation that will forever advertise her complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Artist’s interiority is sensorily rich—palming the humming tile, tracing spirals “like iron filings”—and her renunciation of the mural to the mist is earned. Yet the “socially perceptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we’re told she once “read crowds,” but no live social field tests that gift here, muting the trait’s payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s interiority is specific—her calloused fingers, the tessera biting her palm—and her “retrocognitive” conscience is dramatized through micro-choices (prying the shard, pressing it into the magistrate’s hand). The renaming litany risks performed eloquence, but each micro-rename is tethered to a survivor’s embodied moment. The magistrate’s trembling hand and whispered daughter-laugh crystallize status shift and earned cost. Flaw: the final crowd sequence flattens individual contradiction into choral assent, slightly softening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ghost’s monologue-interiority is rich, synesthetic, and embodied (“the laugh was cerulean with flecks of brass”). Her final renunciation—rooting herself into the sapling—pays off prior causality and costs her spectral form; the micro-choice to whisper “Grow” crystallizes values. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on page, but the depth of sensory interiority and the visible cost of dissolution earn the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied—her calibration ritual and thermal singing are vivid micro-choices—but no contradictory impulse is staged; she glides from observer to conduit without friction or cost, so the final stance feels foregone rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrically specific (“she flipped…to measure the slow collapse of certainty”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses stay largely off-stage; the narrative voice describes her stance rather than staging moments where clashing motives collide under live pressure. The micro-choice that seals her shift—placing the cracked ivory button—happens in a single calm gesture with no visible emotional cost on the page, so the “earned” threshold feels thin. Because no secondary character shares the space, relational crucible and status bullets are N/A; her quiet conviction is memorable yet too serene to register a palpable forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is rich—spy turned “quiet gardener” willing to surrender retrieval. Embodied ache (“burns still throbbed beneath her coat”) grounds agency. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing microfilm, leaving pillbox) track a believable shift from operative to caretaker. One hairline slip: late “unused courage” summary momentarily abstracts the beat that dramatized it.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coachman’s quiet, embodied attunement and the micro-choice to slow the horses by stillness rather than command create a credible, cost-bearing arc of renunciation; the yarn-needle hand-off externalizes his distilled wisdom without verbal throat-clearing. Interiority stays concrete—‘bones grown roots into the rhythm’—and the final offer is earned by decades of prior loss sketched in three swift strokes. Slight deficit: the passenger’s shift from grief to resolve is glimpsed only through facial streaks, so her interior contradiction is presumed rather than dramatized, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.7)
    The potter’s quiet, observant interiority is vividly embodied—“fingers tracing the rim,” breathing “slow as cooling clay”—but her motivation (understanding resistance to change) stays observational; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice visibly forecloses a path, so the renunciation feels gentle rather than costly. The bee interaction is a lovely micro-choice, yet it remains the solitary beat where kindness alters tactics; more friction against her passivity would sharpen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gardener’s interiority is sensorially grounded (smoke in lungs, soil under nails) and her micro-choices—angling each prism, feeling the tooth’s ridges—reveal a hierarchy of values where beauty is measured in millimeters of risk. The lockmaster’s note and her brother’s fire backstory are conjured only when they tilt the present task, so the 17-year gardening history never becomes expository freight. A small flaw: the emotional crescendo is slightly over-articulated (“she did understand now”), nudging the reader instead of letting the embodied gesture speak. Still, the final renunciation—walking away leaving the light to work—pays the earned cost of her vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Veyra’s layered memory (mammoth-walker / botanist / archivist) is dramatized through body-level choices—bare feet on stone, palms flaring gold to steady the sundial—so contradiction and cost are alive in scene. Her final whisper of future coordinates is earned by every prior micro-choice to channel her own resonance, not merely declare it. Reflective skin and reincarnation memory could feel like labels, but they are repeatedly activated under pressure (photon-whispers, cobalt flare) and tied to the story’s one meaningful renunciation: she forecloses mourning itself. The only minor slip is a brief mid-story clause that diagnoses her burden as “map of loss”; still, embodied action instantly reclaims the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—yearning to weave connection while his own soul frays—remains embodied and concrete; the moment he folds strangers’ names into birds, his micro-choice hierarchy (service > self-preservation) crystallizes with visible cost as his body dissolves. The “kept secrets” flaw actively complicates the climax: only because he has carried these stones of trust does he have the material to transform them, so his renunciation feels earned, not abstract. Voice and perception stay idiosyncratic (“ink-stained fingers chased a different rhythm”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak even at the transcendence beat. The sole hairline slip is a trace of sentimental convergence—“exactly where he belongs”—but it is brief and does not undercut the price already paid.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her “quiet grit” and pattern-recognition mindset drive every beat. The contradiction between scientific discipline and stubborn hope is dramatized in micro-choices (tuning the poisoned violin while the campus fractures). Cost is visible: she forfeits credit, sleep, and safety, ending in cold coffee and static vigil. Only minor hedge—no status dynamics on-page—keeps her just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are shown, not told, in her shallow breaths and deliberate descent; the compass needle’s swing to her own chest externalizes her core contradiction and powers the earned change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final renunciation (dropping the compass) is motivated by every prior beat, so the arc lands with visible cost: she forfeits her old identity as mere collector of keys.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s face-blindness and tactile memory shape every beat; her refusal to judge the keeper and demand to “remember them properly” crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Contradictory impulses—methodical data vs. raw empathy—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final faceless sketch of the keeper is earned by every prior texture she traced. No safety-hedging; moral ambiguity stays live.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “nervously confident” trait is repeatedly named but never embodied in a micro-choice that costs her; the copper nail warms but doesn’t force a visible trade-off. Her great-grandfather’s backstory is told in a 100-word expository block that halts present pressure. The decisive act—typing the stanza into the resonance board—reads as effortless victory rather than a crucible that forecloses any path.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fiddler’s interiority is lyrically specific—“silence pooled around him, thick as resin”—and his micro-choice to play again, letting the glass flake go, is a credible renunciation that costs him the relic of the vanished stranger. Yet the dynamically observant trait is declared more than dramatized; we never see his acuity tripping him up or granting an edge that alters tactics. His regrets are named rather than embodied in discrete, contradictory impulses mid-scene, so the final permission to begin again feels gently earned but not scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the contradiction between legacy-loathing and legacy-reenactment is embodied in every micro-choice (tracing escape routes on bills, chalking Fibonacci spirals). The final renunciation—turning collapse into curriculum—pays off prior causality with visible social cost (former employees sipping tea amid ruin). Only the mid-section leap from three-year scaling to sudden fracture is summarized, muting one beat of embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    The chronicler’s contradictory motives—redemptive hunger vs. fear of hoarding grief—are staged inside the lucid dream, forcing her to sing the burden rather than archive it. Interiority stays concrete (“ink-stained fingers tracing constellations that pulsed like living veins”) and culminates in a visceral micro-choice: open her mouth to star-sorrow, knowing she will carry its weight forward. The cost is felt in the final beat—she presses a fresh daylily, accepting tomorrow’s grief—earning the renunciation of solitary witness.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    The druid’s guardedness is dramatized through micro-choices—stepping onto the lake, pressing palm to ice, breathing instead of screaming—each one peeling armor with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs. terror of it) live in the same breath, culminating in the earned renunciation of her fortress of moss. Interiority is concrete (“she feared what it might show her”), never label-heavy. Final unbending is credible because every root that pierces her skin was foreshadowed by the seed’s earlier whispered promises.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush, embodied, and idiosyncratic—“purposefully curious gaze,” “roots deeper into her soles”—showing a mind fused with world. Contradictory impulses (hunger vs. reverence, rootedness vs. forward pull) act simultaneously, propelling every beat. The final surrender to the glade’s exhale is foreshadowed by scar-mapped conduits and clipping-as-key, so renunciation carries visceral cost. No safety-hedging: flaws (oath-breaker lineage, time-stranded chaos) stay live and complicit in the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s barefoot tread and card-cradling hand embody “reckless idealist” without label; her lullaby to the bone-wrapped oak is a micro-choice that stakes her value system. Kael’s spite-cloak and wrist-touch show a mirrored grief, giving the relationship crucible a pulse. The final image—roots weaving both destinies—pays the cost of her gentleness and his vengeance, earning the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jasper’s contradictory impulses—measuring decay yet hoarding a relic—are vivid in the first beats; the cloth micro-choice at the window (“held it to his ear”) embodies the turn from data to sensation. The final pocket-tuck and marker line crystallize earned renunciation of the safety-insulation method. Cost is felt: he forfeits the distance that once protected him. Voice stays consistent, never slips into diagnostic speak; “confidently uncertain” is shown, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete, sensorially anchored (“felt that echo in her marrow”), and her methodological kindness is enacted in the refusal to plant until alignment is achieved. The decisive renunciation—bowing instead of claiming—pays off the buried-dissertation flaw and costs her the monument she might have seized; the causality is intact. Micro-choices (inventing the forgiveness sign, letting tendrils brush without grasping) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Only the tiniest riff of diagnostic self-talk (“physics of transition”) keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian’s moon-tethered interiority is vividly embodied—her spectacles “forged from lunar quartz” reveal a perceptual signature that shifts with her waxing/waning certainty. Contradictory impulses (catalog truth vs. beautiful lies) coexist in-scene, not in summary, and her final smile-with-soul is earned by the prior baptism of the creel. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choice hierarchy is legible when she lowers the creel into liquid moonlight, accepting the cost of softened edges. Flaw: the “wisdom” label in the penultimate paragraph is a hairline diagnostic-speak slip, blunting peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    The inspector’s contradictory impulses—yearning to reconnect yet fearing the raw exposure confession brings—are dramatized in every micro-choice: kneeling to the cave floor, pressing pearl to shell, finally crowning herself. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse syncing with drip-drip,” “envied the dead their release”) and grows more embodied as pressure rises. The visible cost is the emptied shell and the vanished pearl, a literal forfeiture that seals her transformation from seeker to conduit. Voice remains singular, unsentimental, and resistant to therapeutic self-translation even at the peak of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—guilt is “traced” through ivy, bellows, echo-length. Contradictory impulse (to map pain yet shun absolution) drives every micro-choice. The final stance—leave the station rearranged, no note—pays full cost of her methodical penance. Slight peak beat label-speak (“self-forgiveness, a terrain”) docks a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vivid—glyphs etched in her own blood, the watch’s temperature against skin—but the “cautious exuberance” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. Her final silent acceptance is earned by the recursive logic of the archive, yet the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied; we see the mirror crack, feel the mist, but the character’s interior contradiction peaks earlier and stays flat at the climax. Still, the theft-of-voice motif ties motivation to action cleanly, and the endurance of becoming the archive itself is a credible renunciation. Just short of a 9 because the final beat leans on image rather than a last visible internal fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—bare feet on velvet, telepathic plea to plants—yet her contradictory impulses (archive loyalty vs. dream of restitution) stay summary, not simultaneous in-scene. The final stance crystallizes, but the melting violin seeds feel externally orchestrated rather than paid for by a visible prior choice. The telepathy gift enables the climax but never complicates or costs her on the page. Still, her perceptual signature is memorable and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mortician’s intent is crystalline—capture the last glint of sentience before universal erasure—and every tactile ritual (moonpetal oil, aurora-chip) externalizes that monomania. Yet her interiority stays general; we’re told “reverence” but never shown a contradictory impulse that would sharpen her into a singular psyche. The scholar-client is a passive vessel, so no relationship crucible tests her creed. Still, her micro-choices (brush-stroke, lattice-weave) are embodied, and the final vow to become the next lantern earns its cost under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the hairpin yet releasing its grievous history—play out in embodied beats (trembling fingers, deliberate placement above the ear). The final micro-choice, sliding the pin into her own hair, crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she forfeits the identity of the wounded for that of the caretaker. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “contentment… belonging” edges toward abstraction, but the gesture grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—she sells certainty yet trembles at the shard’s memory; the cloak-as-flaw is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choices (bare toes gripping stone, nails digging skin) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation is earned: every “maybe” she silenced is re-admitted, cost felt in the barefoot descent. Only minus: “polished negotiator” is told once where we already see it; a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s paradoxical youth/memory weight is vivid; her grief‐line “colleagues who’d called her mad” lands. Interiority stays concrete (“bare feet pressed to cool stone”). Kael remains a receptive blank; his sole micro-choice—bowing—feels symbolic not crucible-forged. The earned cost is Elira’s withheld final step, a CR that forecloses her own relief; credible but faint on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The skimmer’s stillness-as-quest is dramatized through micro-gesture and arrowhead touch; the refusal to move carries a visible cost in calcified bone towers and the loneliness of centuries. Interiority stays concrete—tuning marrow to crow-wing rhythm—but the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps contradiction theoretical rather than visceral. The Earned Stasis lands cleanly, yet the skimmer’s persona remains more icon than fully flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s interiority is specific—his refusal to “calibrate” magic, the tactile warmth of the keystone against his heartbeat—and his final renunciation is earned. The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he’d spent his life chasing grandeur when grace lived in crooked runes”) that softens the climax; still, the cost is felt when he returns empty-handed yet luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lamplighter’s obsession with “the color of sound” is viscerally embodied in his night dives and ledger touch; contradictory impulses—seeker vs. guardian—surface when he chooses to leave the book for the next wanderer, paying a visible cost (renunciation of sole ownership). Interiority stays concrete through salt-stung skin, rusted chandeliers, the warming brass key; no stock labels. Micro-choices—dive, pry free, surface, walk away—trace a hierarchy of values anchored to vow over safety. Final smile and empty pier show earned stasis: mystery retained, loneliness accepted. The vanished woman stays off-page, so no relationship crucible tested; head-count clarity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—molars, throat, knees—showing surrender-as-method without label-speak. The final refusal to draw lots crystallizes a credible shift from entropy-obedience to self-authored purpose, cost legible in the drachma pressed to skin. Micro-choices (spinning, scattering, pressing coins) trace a hierarchy of values under stellar doubt. Slight emotional plateau mid-vision keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The reaper's interior contradiction—duty-bound yet grieving—remains vivid, but his "heart-carrier" shift is declared more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly abstract because no micro-choice on this page shows him renouncing an actual alternative action. Emotions stay embodied ("echoes clung to his ribs like frost"), avoiding label-speak. One more visible, costly renunciation on-stage would have secured the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lukewarm mage’s contradictory nature—earnest yet doubtful, ritualistic yet empirical—manifests in every micro-choice: timing breath to droplets, not spells; surrendering the bell without testing it. His interiority stays concrete (“threadbare robe fluttering like a flag of surrender”) and bodily (“bare feet chilled by dew-slick stone”), never slipping into abstract self-diagnosis. The final renunciation feels earned because months of obsessive metering have foreclosed every other path; the cost is the bell itself, gone forever. No secondary characters appear, so relationship/status bullets default out; solo-POV coherence is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s reluctant slide from bureaucratic eraser to communal archivist is etched in every micro-choice: pocketing the sapphire label, whispering biographies to ghosts, finally staging the dawn shrine. His contradictory mandate—“precisely humane” deletion versus viscerally humane remembrance—drives every beat and earns the closing renunciation with visible professional cost. No stock interiority; even the refrain “humanity remembers” grows from lived, on-page labor. Interior contradiction, embodied grief, and a hierarchy of values visible in mud-flecked knuckles lift this to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and specific; the alchemist’s contradictory impulses—rigor vs. wonder—are enacted in the moment of surrender to the starlings. The micro-choice to “let the patterns… guide her” rather than command them earns the final absorption of the crystal. Sentimental trait stays covert until the blotting of a tear beside “levitation,” a lovely emblem of hidden softness shaping method. Could wish for a sharper external cost, yet the felt loss of the crystal counts.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s interior contradiction—between truth-telling and truth-revising—remains embodied and active in every beat; the thumb-brushing code and the buckle-click vow are micro-choices that visibly cost her trust capital. The memory of the ruined village keeps the flaw alive, so her final silent walk is earned renunciation, not stoic cliché. No diagnostic label-speak; body memory trumps abstract guilt. The only bar to 9+ is that the external world stays entirely off-stage, so relational/status crucible pressure is absent by structural choice, not lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning to feel yet fearing the self that feeling might restore—are dramatized in his silent, tactile micro-choices (palms on glass, letting noise collapse). The duplicate brain externalizes these splits, and the final renunciation of ownership is earned by the prior balance-work. Emotional embodiment is strong: “warmth return… not the heat of ego, but the quiet glow of presence.” Only minus: the students/judges remain thematic extras; their shouting supplies thematic counterpoint but no status pressure that forces Kael to adapt, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aris’s porous receptivity to the uncanny is shown through his immediate, wordless acceptance of the seed and the nightly soil-braille ritual; the vow beneath the willow embodies an enduring contradiction—embracing stench and decades of waiting—that drives every later design choice. Yet “old and satisfied” compresses a lifetime of obsession into a label, blunting the embodied cost of lifelong monomania. Interiority loops the same abstract refrain (“innovation needs rot”) rather than letting contradictions fester on the page. Still, the final journal line turns the earlier vow into earned stasis: the refusal to force bloom forecloses an easier fame and leaves the seed’s silence as the lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conductor’s grief is viscerally embodied in the tremoring pull-cord hand and off-key lullabies; contradictory impulses—clinging vs. releasing—play out in real time. The final smile is earned because every prior hum has bled sound from silence at rising cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible untested.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    The guardian’s contradictory drives—feral instinct vs. archival longing—are dramatized in every beat (licking frozen cheeks while swallowing whole landscapes). Its micro-choice to surrender the pendant to the statue crystallizes its value hierarchy: companionship over territory. The cost is visceral: it gives away the only tether to its lost library, leaving it paw-empty but relationally re-shelved. Interiority never abstracts; even “dimensional homesickness” is shown via frost-quivering fur and salt-tongued grief.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elric’s “stoically sensitive” contradiction is vividly embodied: he kneels without flinching yet his irises bruise like twilight. Interiority stays concrete—equations whispered, not feelings labeled. The decisive micro-choice—adding his own blood as signature—makes the vivification visibly personal; the cost (permanent twilight in the serpent’s eyes) is legible. The only drag: the summary-laden second paragraph compresses several past failures into one beat, blurring how each scar specifically altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“discarding assumptions” becomes a dramatized, embodied act under lunar pressure. One visible cost: she dissolves the fragment, forfeiting proof and future funding. Micro-choices (raising hands, descending alone) crystallize her hierarchy of values. Slight safety-hedge: competence so absolute it nearly flattens struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Deckhand’s grin-scrubbing mantra never cracks; interiority stays sensory, not analytic. His only micro-choice—tune the radio—carries the entire climax, so the arc hinges on a single beat. Lyrical endurance substitutes for contradiction, keeping the score shy of the 9-band where a costlier internal split is required.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“sinew thread pulsed warm as a sleeping vein,” “she stepped over thresholds that didn’t exist until she crossed them.” Motivation stays coherent: map connection, not escape. The final renunciation—she releases the thread—pays off prior stitching beats with visible cost (gallery ruptures, mirrors show truer selves). Minor slip: no genuine flaw or contradiction compounding mistakes; her calm never cracks under pressure, so arc is more revelation than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s “balancedly curious” trait is shown through calm classroom control and the anchor-link mnemonic, but interior contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized in a moment where curiosity collides with fear or doubt; the final pedagogical triumph feels earned yet costs her nothing on-page, keeping her just below the 9-band where a visible personal price is required.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tracer’s interiority is rich—her “syncopated ache,” her refusal to ignore the summons—yet the girl remains a cipher of grief, not a contradictory child. The tracer’s micro-choice to broadcast rather than listen crystallizes her vocation, but the girl’s consent is too quiet to register as a full relationship shift. Closure is earned: the tracer kneels in damp marble, pays the cost of witness, and forecloses her own exit until the echo stills. Still, the girl’s passivity keeps the dyad just shy of crucible heat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is visceral and embodied (“breath came in shallow gasps… claustrophobia a live wire sparking against stone”); her grandfather-driven motive is continuously re-inscribed through the gold-fleck micro-choices. Flaws (claustrophobia, grief) actively complicate every squeeze and descent, and the final renunciation—staying until water kisses her boots—pays the full cost of that flaw. Contradictory impulses (flee the flood / stay with the remembered) play out in real time, not summary. No diagnostic label-speak; even the metaphysical machine is approached through tactile wariness, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—heartbeat-counting, porcelain shard as tactile tether, barefoot cold—every micro-choice reveals a man living inside a bureaucratic glitch. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. exile, fragility vs. edge) stay live in scene, culminating in the palm-sting that earns his final stance. The only drag: “wisdom from failure” is stated more than dramatized until the ink-mandala moment; earlier articulations feel diagnostic. Still, the endurance costs are felt on the pulse and skin, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s interior contradiction—feeding the diamond noise to extract texture—drives every beat; her quietly-articulate trait is embodied in micro-choices (whispered syllables, precise wrist tilt) that cost her physical strain and social solitude. The final endurance of speaking the mother tongue until the canyon answers is earned by this exact calibrated patience, visible cost in her shimmering veins and hoarse cadence. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority remains specific and sensorily grounded. Flaw: the absence of any observable misstep or blind spot makes her feel slightly super-heroic, blunting full human messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s undercover identity, scar, and marrow-bound entity create a vivid, contradictory interior life; her choice to press SEND crystallizes a credible renunciation of bitterness. The final tattoo-compass shows lasting cost, but the prior static-phone “confessions” are skimmed rather than dramatized, so the emotional groundwork feels slightly abstract. Micro-choices (hiding the scar, gripping the phone) embody motives, yet Moira’s pressure stays ornamental. Still, the arc from bitter exile to gravitational giggles is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—her blistering fingers, heaving chest, juice baptism—without label-speak. Contradictory impulses (gentle bow vs. need to “uproot silence”) play out in real time. Final renunciation—walking away with only pulse—earns its cost through prior bodily expenditure and locust dust. One hairline slip: the grandmother’s off-page whisper is slightly convenient exposition, but it’s seeded early and paid for by later shell dust.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mailman’s “quiet hunt for where broken promises heal” is viscerally anchored in every pedal stroke; his refusal to lie while omitting threads an interior contradiction visible when he bows to guards who search his satchel. The bottled storm physically vibrates against his ribs, giving embodied weight to grief rather than label-speak. Cost crystallizes when the drone lifts and his satchel is lighter while his chest is heavier—an earned price that forecloses his chance to hand-carry the promise. Voice remains singular, border guards kept functional as pressure source, no head-count confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carpenter’s silence is convincingly rooted in vocation, not gimmick; his “interpret silence as possibility” motive is dramatized through sanding, carving, and the final wordless song. Interiority stays concrete—hands rough, breath rhythm, bone hum—avoiding label-speak. The only reason he stops short of 9 is that the renunciation (speech forever forsaken) is assumed rather than tested in a moment of temptation; the cost is felt but not crystallized in a single, legible beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and particular—her coat-pocket ritual, the scarf-as-cipher, the logarithm-lullaby—yet the decisive shift into the tessellation is powered by a single spoken axiom rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her something right then. The grandmother-hem inscription functions as inherited knowledge, not as present-tactic friction. Still, the embodied eccentricity is vivid and the stance crystallization (“she hadn’t come to retrieve…”) is earned; only the activation moment lacks a palpable sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian’s obsessive hunt for her own escaped dream is viscerally embodied—her dawn vigils on the jetty, the palette trembling in salt wind, the final whispered “I had to.” Interior contradiction surfaces when she both chases and finally “simply waited,” a renunciation that costs her the last illusions of control. The grown child’s apparition is earned because every chromatic capture has been dramatized as irreversible expenditure of life-hours. No secondary character exerts pressure, so the crucible is purely intrapsychic, yet it fully delivers earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The locksmith’s interior contradiction—quiet courage versus inherited fear—is dramatized in the mirror-corridor where his own wrist-ribbon renounces the terror the hair-lock once encoded. Embodied cost flashes when the mirrors shatter and stardust lacerates his palms, syncing pulse with the newborn idea. The choice to carry the idea outward is earned by this tactile forfeiture of safety. Voice remains consistent and specific; no diagnostic self-labeling intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The folklorist’s “chronic curiosity” drives every action; her boots-muddy reflexes and notebook-stained fingers embody motive. The micro-choice to kneel, touch the mushroom, then stay inside the greenhouse forces a live cost—she forfeits surface life the moment she smiles and brushes soil from her knees. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, only summary, so the internal conflict beat is missing, capping the score just below 9. Still, the renunciation is legible and character-bound, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Contradictory impulses (retreat vs. mentor) play out in real time; the backwards walk embodies risk and self-imposed exile. Micro-choices—tea-stained annotation, the 37-degree line—visibly cost her authority and safety. The cartographer’s laugh shows her mentorship worked, yet she remains fractured; cost sticks. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interior contradiction—her quiet refusal to let wonder die—drives every micro-choice; the seed’s pulse against her ribs literalizes the cost. No stock labels; even “tears” arrive after concrete sensory memory. The closing tuck of the seed into her tunic is a renunciation that forecloses retreat, fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembling,” “joints stiff”); her calm expertise is credibly strained by the blackened knot, producing a visible cost. Motivation stays coherent—balance, not redemption—yet the absence of any contradictory impulse or personal stake keeps her just short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s quiet, attentive agency—kneeling, brushing, aligning footage—feels lived-in and specific; her childhood memory of drowned villages anchors the obsession without explanatory bulk. Interior contradiction is present but thin: she “weeps, not from sorrow, but from recognition,” a label that grazes rather than pierces. The final act (leaving yarrow) crystallizes her stance, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we feel awe, not forfeiture. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the beat into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s quiet-analytic persona is not a label but a lived instrument: every beat—tallying temperature drops, whispering Amelia’s name, forgoing food/sleep—springs from the same epistemic hunger that finally renounces measurement. The contradiction between hyper-rational cataloguing and the unquantifiable act of release is enacted in-scene, not asserted, culminating in the embodied “cold seeping into wrists” and the open-palm renunciation that costs him the globe and his last tether. Death as “first-name acquaintance” is an earned, personified flaw that shapes micro-choices (waving back at the treeline) and forecloses the path to continued detachment. Interiority stays concrete, character-specific, and contradiction-driven; no stock therapy-speak dilutes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The balladeer’s longing is embodied in ink-stained fingers and barefoot chill; her micro-choice to press the steel plate to the terminal crystallizes her hierarchy of values—communion over safety. Internal contradiction flickers (“tears fell…from wonder of being understood”) yet her flaws never complicate tactics; she is always drift-sure, never mis-stepping. The earned cost is present—the plate warms, her tears fall—but because the ghost does the final decoding work for her, the change feels co-received rather than self-forged. Voice remains singular, but emotional calibration is almost too tidy for someone touching the sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the servant’s contradictory impulses stay submerged; the final acceptance is affective, not earned through a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. The goggles trigger recognition, yet the beat is passive observation rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Still, the voice-specific perception and embodied cold keep her from abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the grief-logic of naming clouds by emotion is consistent and particular. The micro-choice to log Altocumulus #112 as “release” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the final smile feels more accumulated than earned; that keeps her just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is sensorially acute—thumb on coin “valleys and ridges invisible to sight” reveals contradictory impulse: her deficit is her lens. Endurance closure—she sits beneath painted sky she alone will ever see—pays the cost of irreversible loss. Micro-choice hierarchy (renounce escape to finish ceiling) embodies value system. Flaw (face-blindness) drives every tactic and final renunciation; no competence without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlen’s trait of diligent curiosity is shown through embodied, character-specific actions: chalk-dust study, starling watch, muttered phrasebook fragments. His interiority stays concrete (“Excitement prickled his scalp”) and his final smile crystallizes earned fluency. No label-speak; decisions hinge on tangible micro-choices that foreclose the orphanage past and commit him to sky-mapping. Flaws remain visible—he still mutters, still risks—but the cost is the blank page he now confronts, a credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward cosmic self-explanation (“not to fix the world, but to understand…”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure tests her resolve; the gear-alignment happens *to* her. The earlier “solitude over love” backstory is recalled, not enacted, so the final renunciation feels foregone, not freshly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s “purpose” is asserted, not dramatized; she never makes a hard choice that costs her. The settlers’ shift from skeptics to family is summary, not shown in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Kael and Liora function as emblematic roles rather than individuals with clashing motives. The ending’s “walking together” lands as collective mood, not personal renunciation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The adjuster’s vocation—to gentle the end—remains internally coherent and charged; his cracked-porcelain compassion is shown, not labeled. The puppet head functions as an extension of his motive: its cracked cheek mirrors his own scarred palms, making the resonance test personal. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the internal conflict is more tableau than crucible, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caretaker’s weary pragmatism is etched into every micro-choice—heel-dragging arrows, pebble-clusters, the off-hand surrender of the nut—while the interior contradiction (refusing to be heroic yet counting souls like ledger entries) stays live under pressure. The moment he relinquishes the nut costs him his only map of safety, paying the price for endurance in visible forfeiture. Voice remains singular, never sliding into archetype; even the girl’s single line sharpens his idiosyncratic gait. No safety-hedging: his flaw (resentful obedience) directly enables the rescue and seals his return to solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    The chemist’s interior contradiction—clinging to control while yearning for surrender—plays out in concrete micro-choices: gloves off, notebook sketches, final hymn. Embodied grief is vivid (tears left to dry, hair whipped by wind). The enduring flaw (blaming her scaffold) converts to acceptance via river imagery; cost is felt. The shift from isolation to entanglement is earned, not declared. Voice remains coherent and specific; no therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vendor’s interior contradiction—needing to erase herself by trafficking others’ absences—drives every beat; the ledger stylus of frozen breath and the counter-incise ritual embody the cost. Micro-choices (arranging bottles, accepting whispered payment) keep the void she carries palpable. The final image of seven gleaming cuts shows earned stasis: she grows lighter only by distributing weight, foreclosing any return to her own cacophony of roles. No label-speak; trembling fingers and refracted shards do the emotional work.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s synesthetic curse—tasting memories instead of flavors—gives her a visceral, embodied motive that never slips into diagnostic talk. Every micro-choice (removing gloves, kneeling in liquid shadow) is a deliberate self-infection that escalates the cost of her vocation. The hollowing-out at the end is earned: we watch each absorption layer grief until her own identity is re-shaped, achieving Earned Stasis with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “empathetically decisive” label is announced, not dramatized; her sole micro-choice—suspending the cuckoo weight—feels pre-planned rather than pressured. Interiority is lyric-generic (“isolation calcify into silence”) rather than body-specific. Closure relies on communal arrival that she doesn’t actively negotiate; cost is off-loaded to the town, not her. Still, her vocationally trained voice gives a distinct perceptual signature that keeps the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush and specific—her synaptic recalibration of grief into curiosity is dramatized through tactile contact with the mirror, not labeled. Contradictory impulses (meticulous engineer vs. dream-archeologist) coexist in-scene, culminating in the earned laugh that reweights her past. The only nit: “helix-minded” remains a cipher—no on-page evidence of helical thinking beyond the adjective itself. Still, the final pocketing of the mirror carries visible cost: she accepts the child’s ache as her own ballast.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The “prism-minded” trait stays ornamental; Elira’s choices are reactive fetch-quests rather than interior contradiction. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the only micro-choice—tracing the sigil—repeats skill already claimed. Closure cost is asserted (“the chamber sealed”) not felt; she exits smiling, path unblocked. Interiority is scenic catalogue, not embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas’s yearning for music in silence is viscerally embodied—his “phantom chords” and moss-cradling of the insulator—but his interior contradiction (listening vs. imposing) stays abstract; no micro-choice visibly risks failure until the final strum, so the renunciation feels slightly gifted rather than paid for in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The exile-tutor’s interiority is textured and embodied; the thumb-pressed stone, twilight breath, and pulse-synced dent give us contradiction-in-action. Motive arc—from court banishment to covenant re-ignition—stays legible, but the climactic “correlate” moment is more declared than dramatized; we feel resonance, not wrench. Earned stasis still lands because the pocketed stone forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is sensorially rich and consistent; her hierarchy of values (silence > acclaim) is shown through micro-gestures—air-tracing, breath-matching—rather than labels. The pacifist trait is credible because it costs her the option of brute-force entry and is re-expressed in her refusal to flinch at fireworks. The only minor gap: no on-page contradiction that would deepen flaw-driven tension. Earned stasis is legible in her smile at the clasp’s warmth, a quiet admission that tomorrow she will again risk exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—Elira’s olfactory world is rendered with granular, character-specific detail. Motivation (serenity within motion) stays coherent and drives every beat; her final act of replanting the husk is a quiet but costly renunciation that forecloses the bloom’s return. Micro-choices under pressure—inhaling the stench while villagers gag, sketching root-systems on wrapping-paper—reveal hierarchy of values without exposition. No contradictory impulses dramatized in-scene keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s curiosity and grief-hardened competence feel lived-in; the moment she presses the arrow to the Grandmother’s bark crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. Interiority stays concrete (“She wept. / Not from awe. / From recognition.”) and her final renunciation of harvest in favor of listening carries visible cost. Missing: a sharper early contradiction to amplify the later surrender; the “six dead orchards” backstory is told not shown, muting the internal stakes at the inciting skim beneath the arches.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The investigator’s obsession with mapping the wind is rendered through concrete, idiosyncratic micro-choices—calibrating gauges, tracing vectors, pocketing the patch—so motivation stays externalized and pressure-visible. Interiority is dense yet never diagnostic: “I carried it because his last transmission… mentioned a sudden lateral gust” reveals guilt-as-method, not therapy-speak. The final step into the wind—”Let it learn me too”—crystallizes a credible renunciation (he’ll risk becoming the next convergence) and the cost is felt in the chilled hush that follows. Flaw: no secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible is absent; still, the solo stance is earned and closed.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bell-ringer’s synesthetic gift is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward poetic self-diagnosis (“midwifing awe”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the first strike visibly risks or costs her anything; the cavern, not the protagonist, does all the changing. The ending’s “beacon” is asserted, not dramatized, so the arc feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s interiority is specific and embodied—her trembling from precision, not fear, crystallizes a lifetime of custodial discipline. The renunciation at the end is earned: seventeen years of custodial silence make walking away legible as a visible cost. Flaws (custodial caution, scholarly detachment) directly shape her micro-choices—how she breathes across the reed, how she angles each stick. Competence is balanced by genuine epistemic limits: she can map collapse but cannot mend it, so endurance becomes the only stance left.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The operator’s hunger to “map the unmappable” is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; no micro-choice shows her resisting or embracing erosion. Borrowed personalities remain abstract coats, so the cost of losing her own name is told, not embodied. Closure attains Renounced Stasis—she walks away unnamed—but the price feels conceptual, not viscerally earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    The courier’s interiority is rich and embodied (“trembling not from cold but from the weight of his absence”), but the decisive renunciation—releasing the pendant—arrives without a visible micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path; the cost is lyric, not legible on the page, so the arc feels half-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mystic’s interiority is concrete—“fingers tracing…as if reading braille”—and her micro-choice to record rather than preach crystallizes her values with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (scientist vs. believer) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The renunciation at the end is earned by the prism’s warming echo and her earlier refusal to swoon. Only minor reserve: the driver’s psyche is read rather than lived, so the emotional price is vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The spinner’s yearning is embodied in every tactile beat—fingers tracing dull threads, tying the amber bead to the beam—so her choice to self-unravel feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“tears would unravel the weave”) and the final absence lands as credible renunciation. The only minor gap: we never see her hesitate or test a less total sacrifice, so the leap feels absolute rather than ambivalent. Still, the hierarchy of values—message over self—is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid—"felt its call in his marrow," "small and sure"—and Arlo’s contradiction (meek yet unyielding) is active in every descent/forge choice. The final renunciation of silk is earned by the prior pattern of giving it away; cost (loss of magic conduit) is visible. No secondary character applies pressure, so status/relationship bullets are waived; solo micro-choices still trace a credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “tracing the oily floor as if reading braille” shows embodied perception, and her quiet renunciation at the end carries visible cost. The single contradiction (she exists only because her mother violated causality) is held in concrete tension throughout, not merely labeled. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choice hierarchy is clear when she “redirected her breath, her heartbeat, her very intention” to sidestep rather than push. Motive remains character-particular: discovery, not escape, and the final weeping is earned because the shard’s fulfilled pulse dramatizes the price of that knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s grief-trained silence, embodied in the sea-glass anchor and the stone-cairn ritual, yields a credible, earned endurance that forecloses speech as a path while charging the final hum with luminous cost. Interiority stays concrete—‘a draft where safety used to sit’—and the micro-choice to stack stones under spectral pressure crystallizes values without epiphany overload. No contradictory impulses appear on-page, but the absence of a second character keeps relational crucible and status dynamics off-stage, capping the top band. The closure image of a ‘second heart’ pulsing against ribs is fully motivated by prior object handling and grief logic.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The herald’s interiority is lyrically rich yet remains at a single emotional register; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is dramatized under pressure, so the “accidentally prophetic” trait never complicates her tactics or produces visible cost. The final stance is beautiful stasis, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dye master’s interiority is textured—her borrowed pulse, stolen wing, and tear-warmed dye ground her in embodied contradiction. Yet her pivot from replication to self-fracture is more declared than dramatized; we see the insight (“she understood”) rather than a micro-choice that costs her on-page. The old man’s scarred throat and humming offer a perfect secondary crucible, but their magnetism is observed, never tested in a visible decision that risks her new stance. Still, the arc of letting her own fractures gleam is credible and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete—her boots scuffing damp stone, breath caught, smile at the oak’s gift—showing embodied contradiction between technician reflex and pilgrim wonder. Micro-choices (deconstruct-with-patience, set sextant on root, sit to sketch) visibly cost her prior identity and foreclose the “fix-it” path. Motivation stays rooted in arboreal witness desire, intensifying when dreams force her to trade calibration for memory cartography. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; single-POV voice coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is lyrically specific—“pockets stuffed with half-remembered lullabies”—and her barefoot climb up the citrus staircase dramatizes the stakes of memory. Yet her contradictory impulses (cling vs. release the fragments) are stated rather than enacted in real time; the decisive moment of humming is tender but feels willed rather than wrested. The earned cost is present—she surrenders solitary custodianship to become “the loom”—but the turn would cut deeper if earlier beats had forced her to choose between hoarding one precious fragment and risking total loss. Still, within the compressed lyric space, the arc from isolated archivist to communal conduit is legible and moving.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interior contradiction—empathy as liability vs. lens—is dramatized in concrete micro-choices: smoothing the self-addressed invitation over her heart, whispering her own name. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits both exile and return, occupying a ladder-rung sanctuary that did not exist before. No stock labels; every emotional beat is embodied. The only bar to 9.0 is that the library itself, not a second on-page character, supplies the crucible pressure, so relationship dynamics are absent by structural design rather than flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the bread, dress, and seeds act as tangible extensions of her contradictory impulses. The renunciation of the gray shawl crystallizes a visible cost—she now stands exposed to the courtyard’s judgment and her own remembered joy. Micro-choices (kneeling, placing bread, sowing seeds) track a credible arc from mourning to tentative self-re-sanctifying. Only the “permission from the earth itself” line drifts toward abstraction, lightly hedging the epiphany’s grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s “gentle meticulousness” is shown through tactile micro-choices—boot-whisper, feather-precision knobs—yet her interiority stays curiously abstract (“meaning was all that stood…”) and the final smile feels un-earned because no prior flaw or doubt is dramatized. The forgiveness vow momentarily crystallizes awe, but the cost of her vigilance (physical strain, professional risk, loneliness) is implied rather than felt, keeping the arc just shy of full payment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The daughter’s calcified fear-to-purpose arc is embodied in micro-choices (dropping to knee, letting the fob swing) and charged by the grandfather relic that literally re-triggers Marla’s betrayal memory; her refusal to chase or gloat is an earned, costly stance. Interiority never slips into label-speak; tension stays in tendon-level detail. One slight under-trace: why “capture the sound” remains her life’s pivot—backstory hint is thin, but it survives because the final silence is viscerally paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    A contradictory interior (doubt vs pull toward convergence) is active throughout, but the final “trust” arrives as label rather than embodied cost. The ring’s hum and taste cue keep motives sensorily alive. Relationship pressure is absent, so the emotional arc is solo and credible. The abandonment of the ring lands as renunciation, yet the interior contradiction dissolves a hair too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid—her fingers twitch “not from cold but from the inescapable callings,” her tear sizzling on crystal—but the father remains a one-note cipher. The apology to her painted child-self crystallizes a credible renunciation, yet we get no contradictory paternal memory that might complicate her blame. Still, the micro-choice to “add wings” and release each portrait carries embodied cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The calligrapher’s “wilt” is a vivid, embodied cost that scales with pressure; her choice to keep reading aloud is a micro-choice that reverses it, legible on the page. Interiority is concrete (“colour returned to her cheeks”), avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—becoming the archive—earns its cost through the prior wilting pattern. Missing a second character prevents status-dynamics crucible, keeping this just below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tuner’s seasonal muteness and kinetic sculpture craft create a vivid, embodied interiority; her palm-to-ice micro-choice crystallizes values without words. Silence as precision canvas is original and stakes are felt in the child-tremor beat. The final renunciation—she simply stops climbing—carries earned stasis cost visible in the wind-conducted aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The android’s nostalgia is palpable through its embodied micro-gestures (sand on knees, creaking joints) and the literal garden of memory in its chest; the moment it chooses to ignite the fears is a credible, costly micro-choice that fuses caretaker duty with self-preservation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the interior conflict skews slightly summarized rather than simultaneous, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “collects stories not profit” motive is vivid, but her interiority turns abstract in the crucial courtyard beats: “trauma echoes” and “curates catharsis” are diagnostic labels rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation of the locket is credible because her prior micro-choice to hum instead of knock shows listening overriding acquisition, earning the relinquishment with visible cost—she gives away the object and the story it contains.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s interiority is lyrically embodied—“dance was protocol”—and every pivot carries cost. The spider metaphor is lived, not labeled; her final renunciation lands with felt weight because the dice/journal groundwork is laid. Flaw: no second on-page character, so the crucible is solo; still, the self-contradiction (encrypting vulnerability) is dramatized in motion. Calm defiance never slips into saintliness: she stakes her life on the cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s grief-quest for her vanished father is viscerally embodied in the coffee-ground augury and the accumulating wildflowers; the final step-into-pattern is credible because every beat before it shows her cataloguing anomalies with reverent resolve. The “gleaming silence” motif threads her interiority—her trembling fingers, suspended tears, steady lantern flame—so the moment of reunion feels earned, not wishful. No secondary character on-page, so relationship/status bullets N/A; her sole presence carries the piece. The only micro-drag: “salt crystal growing chamber” jargon arrives once and never constrains her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrically concrete—bare feet, dew, heartbeat syncing with ferns—yet the summoner’s contradictory impulses (to silence vs. to hear) stay largely parallel rather than simultaneous in scene. The final renunciation (“she would return… to hear them fully”) is foreshadowed by the whispered line “sky forgets only when earth stops listening,” so the choice feels earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than visceral. A hair more bodily friction or risk would push it into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s interior contradiction—scholarly precision versus occult receptivity—animates every gesture; her micro-choice to trade lies for masonry-grammar is specific and costly. The “patiently nimble” hands earn their keep twice: folding origami from trash-receipts, then pocketing a key that will make her complicit in the building’s sentience. What keeps this from 9+ is that the final ascent into full reciprocal conversation is stared at rather than physically risked—she never tests the clay seal in a wall, so the cost is still conceptual, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is richly voiced—“geometry of grief, lattices of longing”—and every micro-choice (kneel, place shell, whisper vow) is tethered to the archival motive. Contradictory impulses (dread vs. steady breath) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The renunciation of healing for sovereignty is earned through the causal chain of resonance-mapping; the cost—letting the shell go—lands with visible price. Voice stays singular, flaw-present, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven theft vs. priestly absolution—are dramatized in each brush-stroke; the thorn-prick blood-covenant embodies cost. The final renunciation of fame feels earned because every droplet of ink has already cost her literal blood and exile. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “wisely enduring” is named once without on-page micro-choice to embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is sensorily embodied (“frequencies only the richly perceptive could feel vibrating in their marrow”) and her choice to sing rather than destroy the entity is foreshadowed by the lullaby memory; the flaw is a slight over-articulation of motive in “her motivation crystallized” which edges toward diagnostic-speak, trimming the top.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost-whisperer’s interior contradiction—needing truth yet fearing its shatter—peaks when she palms the warm globe and chooses to set it in ice; the haptic micro-choice costs her the comfort of keeping the echo, earning a credible renunciation. Embodied emotion stays concrete (breath curling like incense, palms flat to ice), but “truth, when mishandled, shatters” drifts toward aphorism, blunting full specificity. The child’s cameo-logic is felt only off-page; because the sole on-page agent is the woman, the relational crucible and secondary-pressure bullets are N/A, capping the arc just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is subtle but present—she courts notice while claiming to shun fame; embodied emotion lands in cool stone under bare feet and whisk-grooves against moonlight. Micro-choices (whistling names, palm to erased chalk) trace a hierarchy of values, and the renunciation of leaving no mark is earned. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli, but the arc is observation-heavy; a single decisive external test is missing, capping excellence at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The debunker’s drive to “excavate truth from comfortable lies” is the only motive we ever see; it is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an interior contradiction or tested against a competing desire. Her moment-to-moment decisions (pressing the diamond into soil, turning east) flow from that single stated goal, so the arc is coherent, yet the absence of any micro-choice that costs her something keeps the characterization just shy of the 9-band. No second character appears, so the relationship crucible is N/A. The final smile-into-the-storm image shows earned endurance, but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira’s loneliness and fidelity to the “broken” are vivid, but her interiority sometimes drifts into portentous abstraction (“fractures empires and births constellations”). The micro-choice to piggy-back her song onto Kael’s towers is sharp and earned; still, her contradiction—pity instead of hatred—remains stated rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensor-rich and profession-specific (“calibrating beacon harmonics”), but the climax pivots on a quasi-mystical surrender that slightly outruns the prior mechanistic setup; the emotional cost is felt yet the shift from engineer to “weaver of waves” is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mapper’s interiority is rendered through embodied, concrete actions (hand on viaduct, boots on frost, chalk coordinates) that externalize her quiet insurgency; her internal contradiction—impatience converted into disciplined witnessing—remains dramatized, not labeled. Micro-choices (she “whispered thanks,” “did not celebrate,” “kneels again”) carry visible cost and foreclose the path of spectacle, earning her Earned Stasis. Voice stays singular, idiosyncratic, consistent under pressure; no safety-hedging moral symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied (“grease from her cheek with the back of her glove”); the lantern inheritance and arm-inked names externalize motive. The refusal to flinch and the micro-choice to leave the lantern behind crystallize earned endurance with visible cost. The only drag is a sliver of diagnostic self-awareness (“progress requires amnesia”) that momentarily lifts us out of her sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-driven precision and the way his body registers each mechanical setback embody his penance; the internal contradiction—yearning to deserve failure yet needing success—plays out in micro-choices (re-winding, re-aligning). The final beat grants self-forgiveness only after the heart’s imperfect but faithful pulse mirrors his own, earning the quiet smile. No other characters apply pressure on-page, so relationship crucible is waived. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the flaw (guilt) actively complicates every adjustment he makes.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zeta’s curiosity-as-rudder is vivid, embodied in grease-smudged fingers and micro-choices; the hunter-arrow insertion dramatizes her value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final slump onto the chair shows cost. Yet the absence of a second on-page character keeps status/relationship crucible inert, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The memory-keeper’s compulsion to resurrect the “de-referenced” is rendered through embodied ritual—fingering the scorched patch, mapping 0707 across petabytes—so her final refusal to document anything feels like a costly renunciation rather than mere quirk. Interiority stays concrete: “silence in the archive screamed” externalizes guilt, while the patch’s “humming” against her sleeve keeps the lost crew present. The only minor drag is the vocational label “corporate memory keeper” upfront; once we see her lie to supervisors and burn burner phones, the contradiction between duty and obsession sharpens satisfyingly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The peacekeeper’s interiority is concrete—her contradictory impulse to both hide and heal shows in micro-choices (pressing shard to mirror, whispering the question). The endurance stance at the end is earned through the slow accrual of mirrored glimpses; cost is visible in the shard’s hum and her “small surrender” breaths. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Flaw is present—she accepts incompleeness—but is not dramatized as a mistake that compounds; still, the renunciation carries felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority remains concrete and particular—her “grip reality loosely” stance is dramatized through tactile beats (tapping the parasol tip, climbing the floe). The final renunciation is earned: the shift from resenting reprieves to humming on the ice costs her the safety she once rejected. Minor slip: the three voided waivers are told in summary and never complicate a present choice, so motivation feels one-note rather than contradictory under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to a burned letter while preaching asymmetry—remains embodied in gesture and micro-choice; the final refusal to re-touch Mara’s hand crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost. Only minor slip: Mara’s late admission “I thought I was rejecting you” drifts toward therapeutic paraphrase, blunting the momentary edge.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The walker’s quiet endurance and asymmetrical mask create a credible, low-key mystic; her sole purpose—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—is legible and consistent. Interiority stays concrete (“scent of dry sage and ozone guide her breath”) rather than abstract. No contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her, so the arc is flat, but the consecration still costs her spent focus, satisfying the length’s modest change requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist’s quiet, contemplative agency is consistent and embodied—her gloved fingers, the way she “traced the arc of the kite’s tail,” the hummed line to the lavender. Interior contradiction is present but low-grade: she wants to mend yet must endure the ache of each photo alone. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is waived. The earned shift is the sunset promise to return; cost is the solitude she accepts, but because the choice is a gentle recurrence rather than a foreclosure, the arc feels lightly rather than deeply paid.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scholar’s quiet refusal to resurrect the past but instead to *listen* to its question is a credible, earned renunciation; the cracked voice she finally offers is a micro-choice with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and bias-driven—“dust motes drifting…like tired bones” is perception filtered through her hush-drunk lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only a single steady obsession, so the contradiction slot is empty; that caps her just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prophet’s contradictory impulses—hunger to trap time vs. acceptance of forgetting—are dramatized in every chalk-screech and driftwood placement; his micro-choice to drag chalk across the fender births a sonic ghost and costs the last sliver of chalk, a visible price that forecloses further searching. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the body registers time’s thickening through trembling grip and weeping without sentimentality. The precognitive-forgetful trait is not label-only: it actively disables memory-keeping and forces reliance on external markers, shaping tactics. Earned Stasis lands: he accepts the unknowing, walks backward to preserve markers, accepting perpetual erasure—cost is the half-erased chalk abandoned in dew.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s interior contradiction—freeze time vs. restructure it—drives every beat; the spinning hand externalizes her ache and the leaf-memory actuates the final micro-choice. Embodied emotion (“tears crystallizing in low gravity”) keeps sentiment from sliding into abstraction. The renunciation of control is earned: earlier camera-repair logic (“reframe, not document”) foreshadows the closing braid. Cost is visible: she forfeits linear safety and remains exiled in the tower, breathing into the void.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s serene-decisive duality is embodied in every micro-gesture: cradling broken vinyl, raising it to cloud-light, hymning a wheelchair squeak. The interior contradiction—accepting breakage while seeking reunification—remains active in-scene, not summarized. Cost is visible: shard dissolves, voice exhausts, “no fanfare” renunciation forecloses return to earth. Only lack of secondary pressure or on-page dissent keeps her from full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s interiority is sparse but precise—her quiet deliberation shows in micro-choices (winding the key, recording backlash) that escalate to stepping through the threshold; the final renunciation of saviorhood for stewardship carries visible cost. No secondary character presses her, so status dynamics are moot. The only flaw: “quietly deliberate” is named more than dramatized in early beats, but the trait is finally embodied when she becomes the loop. Closure is earned and forecloses rescue fantasies.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    The skeptic’s interior contradiction—clinging to innocent hope while dissecting betrayal—drives every beat; her soil-pressed thumbs and whispered names dramatize “bone-setting” as lived ritual. The renunciation of vengeance in favor of constellation-making is earned through micro-choices (kneeling, leaving the tooth) that visibly forfeit retaliatory closure. Emotion stays embodied: salt-and-honey syllables, cracked-open pity, dirt under fingernails. One hairline slip: “shrewdly innocent gaze” is label-adjacent, but the contradiction is immediately dramatized, so the flaw is cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction pulses throughout: she polishes to “awaken what it already carried,” not to conquer. Embodied grief—knees damp, glass warming under friction—anchors every micro-choice. The final renunciation (she will speak no sermons) is earned by the prior vow and the tactile hours of polish; cost is visible in her cracked joints and the village burns she refuses to forget. Voice remains singular, perceptual signature tight: mist “like sleeping dragons,” glass “humming” back at her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is sensorial and embodied; the amber pact, moss-pressed palm, and “not fixed but becoming” credo give us a credibly flawed, non-performative arc. Micro-choices (photographing icicles, offering nectar, placing the print-out) steadily re-weight the stake. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9-bar isn’t quite hit, but the quiet renunciation lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The novelist’s interiority is richly particular—her refusal to write, her bones-as-syntax absorption, the micro-choice to release the shell. Contradictory impulses (to preserve vs to release) coexist in every cameo beat. The final bow is earned: she forecloses the “ending” path yet remains lucidly watchful, cost felt as tide soaks her boots.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her coat smells of “moss and machine oil,” a lived-in paradox—but the moment of highest emotional risk (the chorus stepping from the oak) is summarized, not embodied, so the cost is felt more as mythic tableau than as personal consequence. The micro-choice to keep playing when the vine tightens is present, yet the final quiet smile feels lightly earned because the prior beats lean on lyric assertion over visible sacrifice. Still, her flaw—naïve faith in song as universal solvent—complicates the mission and is not tidily cured, satisfying the earned-stasis requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the alchemist’s patience is shown through kneeling in frost, blood-warmth steaming on copper, micro-choices like aligning nails to Orion. Motivation—“translate heartbeats into maps”—is singular and drives every placement. No internal contradiction or flaw-driven mistake is dramatized, keeping her slightly archetypal, but the thru-line of tender, ancient purpose is clean and felt at closure when plate hums against her ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The locksmith’s interiority is lyrically particular—his refusal to stare “head-on,” his cataloguing of shards by “emotional temperature”—but the story never forces him to test that stance against an external counter-force; the only pressure is his own patience. Because no choice risks failure or forecloses a live option, the characterization remains atmospheric rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is concrete—her fingers braid lamp-glow with sobs, her own locket anchors the final beat—but she never faces a true counter-pressure that tests her limits; the man’s arrival is a service request, not a crucible, so her “endurance” feels pre-ordained rather than earned in scene. Micro-choices (aligning the wick, twisting the lamp off) are present, yet the emotional cost is displaced onto the visitor; her own calcification is summarized in the last paragraph, softening the visible price on her. Still, the occupation-specific choreography and sensory embodiment keep her well above generic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s interior contradiction—grief as quiet practicality—survives on the page (“grief had crystallized into something quieter…like checking smoke-detectors”). The carving micro-choices embody her hierarchy of values: let the kettle burn rather than interrupt the listening cut. Final renunciation (setting the half-lion in light) is earned by the prior causal string: blank → listening → vessel-not-memorial. Still, competence feels slightly too safe—no mis-cut or blood is risked, so the flaw-cap stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is concrete, particular, and embodied (“dull, heavy kind that settles in your joints”); the contradictory impulse to hoard regret while yearning to stop is kept in simultaneous tension. The micro-choice to hand the camera to the ghost and accept the empty film is earned by the prior accumulation of fragments and defeats, and it visibly forecloses her obsessive archiving with the phrase “frame it,” not fix it. Flaws—gullibility, solipsism—compound throughout and are accepted, not cured, in the Earned Stasis on the spire. No therapy-speak; voice stays idiosyncratic and sensorily anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s “functionally creative” trait is shown, not told—every micro-choice (cannibalizing conduit, welding scavenged torches) flows from the same internal engine. Interiority stays concrete and character-particular (“mapped stress fractures like poetry”). The final renunciation—she packs the sextant to keep working, not to admire—carries visible cost (no rest, no applause) and is earned by the prior causal chain. Only minor slack: the “equations for hope” verge on label-speak, though the embodied notebook work mostly saves it.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guardian of mechanical silence vs. lapsed composer—are alive in every gentle touch; the micro-choice to cradle the crystal rather than lock it away tips all later beats. The final hum is credible renunciation, not epiphany, and costs him the last residue of public ambition. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through clock-oil scent and brass gleam, never drifting into label-speak. The only drag: the dream’s prior “fossilized” state is told in summary; dramatized shard would have lifted the score into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The seeker’s quiet, observant agency is credibly particular: he angles the sundial for “the tilt of memory,” kneels to feel water temperature, refuses to grab the glint too soon. These micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values—truth over possession, patience over spectacle—without therapeutic gloss. Interiority stays concrete and embodied; the only near-slip is “realization settled: the lies weren’t built to deceive others…” which momentarily abstracts. Still, the arc of renunciation (he salvages understanding, not the locket) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured (“collecting hands”), embodied emotion vivid (tracing knots), micro-choice to kneel and offer fulgurite signals motive. Patience trait stays active, but no internal contradiction surfaces; the arc is steady acceptance rather than a clash of wants. Closure cost is felt via the coil of rope she now carries, yet the shift from seed-collector to knot-bearer is declared more than dramatized. Still, specificity of gesture and idiom keep her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The traveler’s compulsion to map absence through “intimate cartography” is credibly internalized; the wrist-thread as memory-totem recurs and physically pulses at the climax, grounding motive in body. No second on-page character means relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices are confined to writing/folding the crane, a quiet but earned act of renunciation that forecloses public witness. The flaw: emotional state is sometimes labeled (“lonesome splendor”) rather than embodied, and the interior contradiction—write to keep alive yet accept permanent gone—stays abstract until the final line. Still, the mapping drive stays consistent and the thread’s final warmth gives a felt, if modest, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prince’s contradictory impulses—yearning for beauty while welding brass petals—are shown in scene, not summary. His interiority is concrete: “beauty was oxygen,” not a slogan but a lived panic that drives micro-choices like threading gramophone filaments. The final renunciation of certainty lands with visible cost: palace chains singing, mirrors shattering, his knees bloodied on marble. Single-POV baseline met; no stock labels, no voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—loving the father who taught her fire’s language while devoting her life to stopping it—are kept alive in every beat. Her micro-choice to thread the coin onto the obsidian wrist is visible, embodied, and freighted with cost: she binds herself to monitor a legacy she can’t excise. Interiority stays concrete (“safety without shame” felt as kelp-drift) and avoids diagnostic labels. The only slight undercharge is that the “wild love refined” distinction is asserted more than dramatized in the present scene; nevertheless, the stance crystallizes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skeptic’s “sidereal patience” is dramatized in her deliberate micro-choices—kneeling, brushing the key, holding the box to the light—each one legibly a test of endurance against the city’s forgetting; the brass key insertion is a visible wager that costs her the box’s stored weight, a concrete forfeiture. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic: “the box hummed—not audibly, but in the marrow of her bones.” No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, only serene conviction; because the single POV never flags, the absence of overt flaw-struggle is acceptable within length. The liberation is earned: she enables others’ memories, accepts residue of gratitude as sole payment, and the final single drop reweights her stillness into earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sentimentalist’s refusal to repeat ancestral fire-burning is strong motive, but interiority drifts into cosmic lyric rather than dramatized contradiction; no micro-choice is visible when the gear is laid down, so the renunciation feels asserted, not earned. Embodiment is gorgeous (“shimmering like heat-haze”) yet monotonous—no corporeal limits or fatigue under pressure. The gear’s transformation is credited to singing vibration, but the causal link between song and bronze feeling is asserted off-page; the cost is aesthetic, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—grief as geometry yet motion as migration—grounds his fierce meditative stance; the embodied image of “thundering calm” at the chisel shows contradictory impulses acting in-scene. Ribbon-tying micro-choices (one per poem/name) visibly reorder his workspace, enacting a hierarchy of memory over commerce. Closure earns renunciation: he picks up the chisel not to finish but to begin again, foreclosing solitude with felt cost. The flaw: mentor’s guidance never tests a wrong move; perfection flattens flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—perfectionist vow versus the need to surrender—is dramatized in the pendulum pause; the micro-choice not to wind is earned by forty-three years of prior beats and the hidden-rake revelation. Emotions are embodied (knuckles white, knees stiff) without diagnostic jargon. The flaw that complicates his life is the same flaw that must accept grace, making the renunciation credible and costly. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority is sustained, specific, and drives the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Gardener’s interior contradiction—tenderness for the dead vs. need to disturb their silence—drives every micro-choice; the final shift from lullaby to question is earned by the tapestry’s forced recognition of her own complicity. Embodied emotion (palm on fabric, dust on tongue) stays specific; no diagnostic labels. The silver needle drawn from her own sleeve literalizes cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is luxuriant but stays generic—“breath curling,” “dared to be fertile” could belong to any seeker; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene, only asserted. The decisive micro-choice—touching nib to parchment—is motivated, yet the cost (fear of error, physical cold, solitude) is declared rather than embodied. Still, the arc of renunciation (she once forced grandeur, now coaxes) gives her a credible ethical contour within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The copyist’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, ember-lit posture, tear-blurred staves—yet her contradiction (rebellion through monastic patience) stays mostly asserted rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The pivotal “let herself cry” beat is tender but arrives as gentle permission, not an irreversible cost; the path forward stays open, so the renunciation feels lightly rather than mortally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scatterer’s mask-as-identity and refusal to remove it crystallize a credible, costly stance; the embodied ritual (bare feet, ash scattering) shows contradictory impulses—preservation vs. exposure—yet the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“the mirage of safety”) that blunts contradiction at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is rich—“abrasive calm,” “deliberate pacing,” “muttering counter-arguments”—but the arc is static endurance; no contradictory impulse forces a visible pivot, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her lifelong habit of “subtracting noise” is dramatized through the low hum she offers the empty room, a micro-choice that risks further solitude. The contradiction between her public vocation (choir) and private retreat (silence) is active in-scene, not summarized. The final assent to teach the girl is credible because the text has shown her maintaining posture, voice, and attention despite decades of non-audience; the cost is the surrender of her hard-won quiet. Only minor deduction: the girl’s dialogue is slightly too articulate for first nervous words, a faint ventriloquism that briefly thins the realism.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s synaptic-tasting gift is concretely embodied (“flavour exploded across her tongue”) and motivates every micro-choice; the gentle-rebellion stance is lived, not declared. Interiority stays anchored in sensory immediacy (“swallowed them gently, rewiring her own grief”). The final renunciation—curator, not conqueror—carries visible cost in the crooked silver-blue sapling she will never harvest. No contradiction under pressure; the flaw is slight over-articulation of theme in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s compulsive truth-telling is more atmospheric label than active crucible; it never forces a costly on-page choice. The “preserve wonder” motive is asserted, not dramatized—he never risks safety, reputation, or emotional stake to protect the secret. His handing over the matchbox is gentle but consequence-free; no visible price for secrecy or revelation. Interiority is evocative yet static; contradictory impulses are named (“truth spilled”) but never clash under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The noticer’s interiority is textured and embodied—her barefoot chill, the “hushed blaze” in her ribs—but the piece stops short of letting her contradictory impulses collide in a single beat; the final renunciation is earned yet emotionally monovalent, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The historian’s wonder-driven interiority is concrete and embodied in her regulator-bubbles and trembling gloved fingers; the statue’s contradictory impulse—to preserve yet dissolve—peaks when it guides her hand to its own cracked knee, a micro-choice that forecloses its marble stasis. Cost is felt: the statue liquefies, she surfaces burdened with mutable truth. Minor slip: “incisively kind” drifts toward diagnostic label in the climax, trimming full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grim optimist’s marrow-deep contradiction—climbing to capture the texture of not-climbing—remains vividly embodied; every footfall and whispered proof is a micro-choice that keeps regret alive. The chipped die’s click and eventual vanishing externalize the interior fault-line; his laughter when the stairs keep moving while he sits is a perfect earned stasis. No epiphany resets him; instead the staircase digests his equations and he keeps ascending, now carrying the captured texture inside—cost felt in the empty pocket. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied tension between hope and futility stays specific to this body, this step.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter’s quiet, nightly ritual and belief in encoded kindness are vividly interiorized; her refusal of fame/catharsis in favor of anonymous transmission gives her a crisp, idiosyncratic spine. The only lack is a second beat where her own kindness costs her something tangible—she stays safely in the giving role, so the arc is more stance-deepening than path-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s rescue-of-art motive is vivid and embodied—she bakes, scans, documents—but the interior contradiction (why risk for mere song?) is asserted, not dramatized. No moment shows her tempted to quit; the arc is uplift without friction. The final renunciation of ghost-hunting is implied, not costed on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid—“salt spray gnawed at his coat,” “bleak exhilaration”—and the final clutch of the paradox-gear embodies a costly micro-choice. Motivation stays anchored to “refusal to inherit” fate, but the absence of any second character keeps relational pressure and status dynamics off the page, capping depth. Still, contradictory impulses (salvation vs. solitary cost) coexist inside single beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test for short-form.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“the gurgle of drowning…”) and the final extraction of memories is embodied, but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized in-scene; the advisor’s opaque motives weaken relational pressure. The earned stasis lands, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than tactile because the “photographically cursed” trait is never allowed to block or enable a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Prophet’s marrow-deep drive to “turn obstacles into instruments” is dramatized through every beat—kneeling, humming, handing the mallet—so motivation stays kinetic. Kael’s micro-choice to strike the apple crystallizes apprenticeship under pressure, showing hierarchy of values (record vs. act). Interior contradiction is implied rather than embodied: we never feel the Prophet’s fatigue in his body, only “exhausted” tagged at the end. Still, the closing cost is visible—the orchard’s sigh, the inward tide—so the arc earns its renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quietly driven is shown, not told, through seventeen seasons of notation and a packed satchel; the hollow ache is anchored in concrete ritual (whistle at dusk) rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction pulses—obsession vs. city denial—embodied in tactile map-creases and reed against sternum. Final micro-choice to climb at midnight is earned by prior causal chain: watcher’s head-turn → proof of listen → personal risk. Cost is felt: she may become “another name whispered”; refusal to wait forecloses safe citizenship.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich—“ivy… like veins of forgotten time,” “pulse quickened not from fear… but from the weight”—and her renunciation of triumphalism is embodied in the quiet exit. Yet the causality of her decision to “draw parallels” rather than publish raw is asserted in reflection, not dramatized under pressure; the cost is announced, not tasted. Still, her calibrated emotion and the final refusal of triumph earn a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—archeologist of abandoned dreams—gives her a single, legible through-line that escalates with each note placed; the porcelain-doll beat dramatizes embodied tenderness against stoic armor. Interiority is concrete (“salt mingling with brackish water on her cheeks”), yet some summary labels linger (“stoically sensitive”). The final renunciation—empty inkwell, clarified self—earns its cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Indexer’s interiority is concrete—pressing the stamp into her palm, salt-smeared spectacles, shorthand on waterproof vellum. Active stillness is shown through micro-choices: prying the fused ledger, cross-referencing tide tables, annotating the Master Index. Motive stays legible: witness, not vengeance. Final renunciation—accepting consequence over condemnation—carries visible cost as the stamp warms in her grip.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s grief is rendered through embodied ritual—soot-stained fingers, thumbnail cranes—and the micro-choice to polish the final sapphire in silence crystallizes his arc; the cost is felt when the basilica trembles and the isle drifts sideways. Interior contradiction is present yet subtle: he both feeds and starves the shadow. The origami crane that hovers at the end is a credible Earned Stasis: he accepts a living warmth that can never replace her. A hairline slip: “luminous torment” veers toward label-speak in the climactic paragraph, nudging down from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid—“each step a quiet defiance against the silence that had replaced her heartbeat”—and the geode’s pulses give embodied contradiction. Motivation stays consistent: cartography of lost possibility, not revenge. The final micro-choice—thrusters queued while she whispers names—earns her bleak exhilaration. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible absent; head-count clarity perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and sensorially anchored (“tears tracing paths through dust”); micro-choice of aligning star-trails to activate the chip shows values hierarchy. Interior contradiction is present—awe vs operational vigilance—but the epiphanic shift relies on a外部的 harmonic device rather than a prior flaw compounding cost; still, the renunciation of perpetual scanning lands as credible Earned Stasis. Voice specificity wavers in a few stock phrases (“never flinched,” “second skin”) but overall reads as an individual professional sensibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    The guilt-ridden genealogist is realized through embodied micro-choices—bare feet on cool tile, the vomiting reflex, the final pocketing of the silent watch hand. Interior contradiction pulses: she loathes falsifying bloodlines yet kneels to "weave truth," a believable flip driven by the sacrificial reveal. One flaw: the sacrificial backstory arrives as pure memory-dump rather than forcing a present-tactic change; still, her stunned physicality keeps the arc coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured—her fingers tracing the drawer pull anchors memory without summary labels—and the final swap of relics crystallizes a hierarchy of values. However, the brother’s off-stage death and the courtroom backstory remain abstract; the emotional cost is felt but not embodied in a present-tense physical reaction, so the renunciation reads slightly under-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    A strong interior arc: the shift from vector-thinking to tide-feeling is dramatized through micro-choices (naming poles, pocketing the washer, turning back to the kayak). The mutiny/backstory is kept off-stage, so the cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the final stroke shows earned alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The seeker’s interiority is vivid—“hollow might fill with something warmer than regret”—and the micro-choice to release the baseball crystallizes a contradictory impulse: clinging vs. letting go. The memory-wipe backstory is anchored to present stimuli (lake’s ripples, floating ball) and tilts the stance twice: first to kneel/listen, then to walk away. Empathy is not declared but sparked by submerged chairs/children’s shoes, showing embodied cost. Flaws (hollowness, jadedness) complicate the lake confrontation; the renunciation is earned because the lake’s fractal ripples literalize paths foreclosed. No secondary character pressure—Kael is atmospheric chorus—so relationship crucible bullet not triggered; single-POV voice stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The beast-whisperer’s interiority stays sensuous and specific (“bone learning feather, blood learning flame”), but her contradictory impulses sit mostly in lyric summary rather than dramatized split-second choice. The climactic surrender is credible and costly, yet the prior motivational shift from skepticism to belief is compressed into a single paragraph of reflection. Still, the embodied paradox of steady tremor and the final “anchor” nickname crystallize a memorable, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is lush, specific, and embodied—her trembling fingers, the taste of storm on syllables, the way roots cradle her wrist. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. surrender) act simultaneously in scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—pressing forehead to the saucer, letting lost time go—earns its cost through prior tactile memory and the tattooed pulse of her daughter’s name. Micro-choices (unfastening coat, pressing palm) visibly reweight values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elira’s pacifist interiority is vivid—floating under joy, magnetized under grief—but the “shadow work” is declared more than dramatized; the mirror-self appears only at the threshold, so the internal contradiction never complicates a mid-story choice. The final embrace is moving, yet the cost feels cosmically distributed rather than personally foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrically specific and embodied (“tears evaporated…mist curled like loyal cats”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses stay atmospheric rather than crystallized in a single decisive micro-choice under pressure; the final beat accepts rather than selects, so the cost feels conceptual, not personally foreclosed. Still, the renunciation lands as credible Earned Stasis because every prior release has been dramatized, making the empty-handed smile feel inevitable rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentinel’s calm inventiveness is shown through embodied micro-choices (aligning the gnomon, folding the vellum) rather than labels; her contradiction—smiling while guarding silence—creates interior tension. Yet we never glimpse a private stake or fear that could be lost; the mission is abstract, so the final image feels more cool than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorily embodied and particular—his soles read tide-pool temperatures, breath carries pigment scent—yet the contradiction between wanting wonder and hating foreknowledge stays mostly associative rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-choice. The final “soundless laugh” and sphere placement do crystallize a credibly earned shift from curse to tool, with the grandmother-memory as cost, but the beat is compressed into one luminous phrase rather than pressed by an immediate dilemma that forces visible loss. Still, the voice-specific perceptual bias (shadow steps, frictionless gait) keeps characterization consistently individual and avoids stock epiphany language.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich, lyrical, and sustained; the poet’s contradictory impulses—“furiously tranquil,” writing vs. sealing—are alive in every beat. Micro-choices (timer reset withheld, envelope pressed to chest) dramatize value hierarchy under pressure. Endurance is earned: the refusal to open the archive today carries visible cost in the storm-lit final image. Flaw: the “cartography of scars” motive is stated more than tested; no new wound or map-choice complicates her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The philosopher’s mechanical arm, needle card, and sundial calibration reveal a mind that externalizes thought into mechanism; every micro-choice (aligning perforations, rotating the card) is a visible cost. Interiority is shown through tactile precision rather than label-speak—his “brass fingers twitching in rhythm with the quiet brook” embodies impatience without naming it. Contradictory impulses—collaboration versus intellectual dominance—play out silently beside the dial, culminating in the earned renunciation of leaving the spent card behind. Minor slip: “diplomatically fierce” is asserted once rather than dramatized in speech, a hair’s-breadth short of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Molt’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her cynicism peels under grief, shown through the nail-pried tin and dirt under thumbnails. Monthly molting stays label-only; no on-page contradiction of skins or cost attached. Relationship with Elias is memory-only; no live status shift to test. Final renunciation of sardonic skin is legible and earned by the candle-and-seeds beat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete—condensation-slick keys, vinegar-and-ozone reel—and her contradictory impulses (grief vs. defiance) act simultaneously in scene. The final chord is earned: every prior modulation maps to the lover’s film cipher, so the audacious note literally rewrites local physics and pays the cost of the burned reel. Micro-choices (threading the film, modulating to minor seventh) reveal a hierarchy of values where love > causality. The only keep-back: the lover’s laughter arrives off-stage; if he had stepped into the light the relational crucible would have locked at 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—“doubt is the lantern”—carries through beat to beat; his tremor at misinterpretation is embodied, not declared. The seed-handling, chant, and stylus tracing are micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy: memory > ego. Closure shows earned endurance: he gives the last seed away, foreclosing any redo, with the cost visible in “small and weary.” Missing 9-band because Elira stays off-page, so relationship crucible and status shift cannot test him.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elio’s quiet resolve is consistent, yet his interiority stays largely expository (“He understood then…”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The lace ritual gives him one active micro-choice, but we never feel him wrestle an alternative; the cost is atmospheric, not personal. The juniper’s new leaves twin as payoff, but the emotional price is transferred to the island, not Elio. Still, his calm bonsai gaze is specific and keeps him from sliding into cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation—stripping “needless drama”—is embodied in precise micro-choices: discarding gloves, sleeping beside the slide, teaching children with breath and chalk. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through tactile engagement with dust and decay. The final renunciation of astrophysics isn’t a rejection but a recalibration earned by her sustained attention to micro-shifts. Her humility feels kindled, not declared, because it arises from witnessing—not interpreting—the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trauma, artistic discipline, and evolving philosophy emerge through tactile detail (ash on ledger fibers, frost on stone) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (kneeling at dawn, fusing glass with canyon sand) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet resilience. The final renunciation of commerce for gifting art feels earned by her consistent pursuit of meaning in pauses. No emotional summarizing; every insight arises from concrete action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The survivor’s silent expressiveness is embodied through precise gestures and micro-choices (e.g., warming the fork on her wrist, weeping from marvel), avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—translating silence into music—is rooted in loss but propels active, tactile engagement. Internal contradiction surfaces subtly: grief coexists with resolve, not as alternating states but simultaneous pressures. The final renunciation of auditory reliance (“She didn’t need ears anymore”) is earned by prior bone-deep resonance experiments.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The undertaker’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, bone-handled tools, and “inadvertently stubborn” resolve reveal a lifetime of quiet grief without therapy-speak. His micro-choices (tracing the crack, dismantling the lens, embedding shards) align with his core identity as a rest-giver. The final renunciation isn’t escape but deeper commitment, foreclosing surface life with visible cost: he walks “deeper,” not up. Contradictory impulses—resignation vs. flare of agency—act simultaneously in scene, especially when the library groans “not from pressure, but recognition.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation—intergenerational care over rebellion—is consistently embodied in micro-choices (not ringing the bell, leaving baskets) and deepened by backstory that alters present action. Her internal contradiction (desire for connection vs. necessity of anonymity) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final renunciation of credit is earned through prior causality and carries visible social cost: preserving communal resilience over personal recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    The artist’s motivation—finding where unused love is stored—is embodied through precise, character-specific actions: breath rhythms, lens adjustments, and tactile engagement with the obscura. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through ink-stained hands that tremble only at the thought of the pilgrim. The final renunciation isn’t of love, but of possession—she accepts permeation over ownership, a credible endurance with felt cost. Every micro-choice (shallow vs. deep breaths, packing “with reverent haste”) reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in spiritual curiosity, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation—to feel time’s texture—is embodied in every sensory detail and micro-choice, from barefoot walking to caressing the halo fragment. Her retrocognitive trap isn’t exposition but lived contradiction: she feeds the garden her past while seeking its grain. The final smile trembles with earned cost—her photographs gone, yet perception deepened. No diagnostic labels; grief is “coarse,” joy “porous,” rendered through tactile epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    The chained liberator’s motivation—rooted in quiet defiance and agrarian stewardship—is embodied through tactile choices (planting spores, scattering seeds) rather than declared. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, contradiction emerges in her simultaneous vulnerability (chains) and agency (decoding the piano). The final renunciation—leaving the acorn key in the arrow—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: she walks into certain danger, weighted by seeds, not weapons. Every micro-choice reveals a hierarchy where resilience outweighs survival.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in grief for her sister and the urgent need to capture the sound of trust breaking—is embodied through precise, sensory-driven actions (e.g., feeding absences into the forge, monitoring marrow mitosis). Her internal conflict between scientific pursuit and emotional devastation manifests simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to leave with the memory-catcher—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: her body is “thin from hunger,” her spirit “scarred by echoes.” No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion emerges through bone-deep perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    The thief’s motivation—“to press your ear against destiny’s door”—is embodied through precise, costly micro-choices (e.g., kneeling to place flowers, pouring moonbeams) that reveal her hierarchy of values without exposition. Her internal contradiction (observer vs. intervener) acts simultaneously in scene, and her emotional arc culminates in tender invisibility, not triumph. Secondary characters apply immediate pressure relevant to her central conflict, and their reunions feel earned by her symbolic nudges. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through action and charged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glassblower’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, frayed bookmark, and ritualized narration reveal a psyche shaped by loss and reverence. Her motivation to “abandon power” and “craft safe zones for inquiry” emerges organically through micro-choices (sweeping dust, sealing the bookmark in glass) that carry visible cost: she leaves behind stability to seed fragile sanctuaries. Contradictory impulses—control vs. surrender, preservation vs. release—act simultaneously without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (“she wouldn’t stay”) feels earned, with emotional progression anchored in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s phobia, adaptive resilience, and trauma are embodied through concrete actions—flinching, trembling hands, decoding smudges—not diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) act simultaneously in scene, especially when kneeling on splintered boards while mind stays sharp. The final renunciation of victimhood is earned by prior causality: her decryption work directly enables the burning of the reel. Cost is felt in the loss of identity (“name dissolved like sugar”) and the irreversible fire.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The oracle’s obsession with silence is embodied in precise, contradictory impulses—she maps absence yet clings to the flaking booklet; she endures the storm yet shapes its hush. Her micro-choices (tracing salt-stained pages, summarizing gull cries) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in decades of listening. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority; emotion lives in calloused fingers and moth-wing whispers. The final descent into the night she charted is an Earned Stasis with visible cost: her time measured in sighs, her work left as ghostly anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The robot’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and free of diagnostic label-speak; its micro-choices (tuning the violin to emotional frequency, replaying activation memory) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The epiphany—that thought arises from being witnessed—is earned through layered, recursive perception, not summary. Its flaw (initial misdirection of inquiry outward) compounds meaningfully before resolution. Final renunciation of external answers in favor of internal resonance constitutes Earned Stasis with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s motivation—thawing mistrust through transparency—is embodied in precise, vulnerable actions (placing tickets, angling the lens) rather than stated abstraction. Her interiority is concrete (“lens cool against her ribs,” “breath even”) and consistent with her quiet role. The keepers’ micro-reactions (Tannis tracing the spiral, Vorr grounding his palm) reveal relational stakes without dialogue. Final choice—walking away after trust is restored—earns closure through prior causality and visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The vine dresser’s motivation—rooted in reciprocity, memory, and quiet defiance—is embodied through tactile ritual and consistent micro-choices (e.g., ignoring the intern, placing the petal). Her internal contradiction (fear masked as indifference during the frost) is dramatized without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (“the garden doesn’t comply. It consents”) is earned by forty-seven springs of practice and carries visible cost: isolation, bureaucratic pressure, and the dead wrist-band. Her flaws (stubbornness, refusal to adapt) complicate but do not cripple her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her mechanically warm demeanor, obsession with empirical proof, and quiet defiance of colleagues—and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal contradiction (scientific rigor vs. intuitive leap) manifests in embodied choices: bypassing protocols, gripping the lever, adjusting it by 2.7 degrees. The adjacent-self encounter reveals terror beneath resolve without therapy-speak. Final renunciation isn’t of goal but of isolation—she now maps “adjacent presents,” a shift earned by prior causality with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The musician’s motivation—decoding silence through absence—is deeply internalized and embodied, not explained. Her micro-choices (angling the lantern, mirroring gestures) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over sound, resonance over performance. The ghost isn’t a plot device but a mirror of her own artistic ethos. Final renunciation—playing without an instrument—earns closure with visible cost: she leaves changed, carrying purpose instead of fame.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trembling, stiff joints, and raw voice ground her emotional state without diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (to hide vs. reveal truth) manifest physically through the smudged illustration and the act of pinning it outside. The final micro-choice—facing the oracle again and asking for a human definition of “fault-tolerant”—reveals a hierarchy of values: endurance over escape. No safety-hedging; her flaw (swallowed silence) directly fuels the story’s central cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—driven by grief, guilt, and a need for calibration—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., removing gloves to touch the valve, pocketing the radio) that reveal her internal hierarchy of values. Her religious skepticism isn’t just stated but actively shapes her interpretation of events until the radio forces confrontation with self-deception. The final act of walking home “steadier” reflects Earned Stasis: she accepts the weight rather than seeking external absolution. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion is rendered through tactile detail and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is richly embodied—trembling palms, tears for beauty, softened wax—and their motivation to witness without judgment is consistent and deepened through micro-choices (e.g., unfolding the swan deliberately, choosing not to preserve but observe). However, the character remains archetypal; their transformation (“softened, like wax”) lacks specific contradiction or struggle beyond lyrical abstraction. No secondary characters appear, so relational dynamics are irrelevant, but the absence of internal conflict beyond acceptance slightly limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile rituals, quiet grief, and adaptive presence feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (not standing, singing wordlessly, passing the curl) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in nurturing wonder over performance. The baby hair curl functions as both emotional anchor and active catalyst, grounding her motivation without sentimentality. Flaws are subtle but present: her passivity risks bordering on saintliness, yet the story earns it through consistent behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The historian’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile perception, emotional restraint, and micro-choices (e.g., probing the hearthstone, cross-referencing texts) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to preserve unspoken stories—fuels every action without sentimentality or diagnostic self-awareness. The final decision to descend into the underlibrary emerges organically from her accumulated knowledge and perceptual acuity, with the cost of isolation and burden implied in her solitude. No head-hopping or omniscience; her limits and competence feel human and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—transposing life into a new key—is embodied through rhythmic rituals and micro-choices (e.g., timing fortunes with ferry arrivals), not stated abstraction. His internal contradiction (recluse vs. orchestrator) plays out in action, not summary. The final beat—hiring the analyst—shows credible endurance of his role without sentimentality. Flaws like isolation are woven into his method, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    The priest’s motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions through rhetoric—is embodied in every micro-choice, especially his final act of painting a question mark in negation. His interiority is concrete (“cassock stitched from frayed audio tape,” “ghosts of layered chants”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The contradiction between his desire to resist possession and his complicity in inviting it through questioning feels authentic and earned. His renunciation of certainty, not the void, carries visible cost: an empty palette, deeper silence, readiness for recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to conduct unheard symphonies of memory—is vividly embodied through micro-choices (tracing the shell, whispering fortunes into glass) and contradictory impulses: yearning for return yet refusing to forget, creating despite exhaustion. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using sensory-rich recollection instead. The final renunciation (“smiled… because she had remembered how to try”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of bodily and temporal limits.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The gravity defier’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fear, shame, and defiance manifest through tactile choices (touching walls, speaking confessions) rather than diagnostic labels. Contradictory impulses coexist: she both flees and seeks integration. Her final renunciation (“I am the branching”) feels earned by recursive confrontations with past selves. The cost—reality trembling, viaduct cracking—is legible and scaled to her psychological stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s deafness isn’t a label but a lived sensory architecture—her motivation (defeating numbness) is embodied through micro-choices like pressing palms to the floor and repurposing the needle. Her internal contradiction—fear of hollowness versus yearning for connection—is dramatized without therapy-speak.

Final endurance (“Confirmed,” then descent) earns Charged Poise with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)

The music box functions as both emotional archive and tactical tool, revealing character under pressure. No safety-hedging; her moral ambiguity and strategic patience feel specific, not archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)

Her micro-choices (coaxing the vow with honey, stitching it to the ribbon) align precisely with her belief in repair over redemption. The daughter’s off-page presence exerts credible pressure through artifacts and memory. Final renunciation isn’t tidy; she persists not for reconciliation but because tending wisdom across generations is her irreducible duty.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    The curator’s motivation—rooted in archival silence that “hummed in her bones”—is specific, embodied, and intensifies credibly. Her micro-choices (e.g., retreating to the bathroom alcove) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over protocol, solitude over consensus.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)

Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest as tactile perception (“sighs” in ice, “tension” in stone).

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation—defying the gravity of hopelessness—is embodied in micro-choices (untieing the rag, stepping the sequence) that carry visible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is rendered through tactile perception (“silence that tastes of ozone”) and contradiction (playfulness amid grief).

    The lore keeper’s motivation is singular and consistent, her interiority rendered through embodied perception (“moss that whispered ancestral names,” “heart syncing to the orchard’s rhythm”). Her final choice—embracing understanding over dominion—is earned by prior micro-choices (peeling paint, trusting the flake). However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we see resolve but not simultaneous competing impulses under pressure.

    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her scars, breath, and trembling knuckles manifest psychological states without diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)

    Elira’s motivation evolves organically from archivist to catalyst, grounded in embodied memory and contradiction—her reverence for preservation clashes with the need to awaken.

Her micro-choices—kneeling to harvest, softening speech at the survivors’ request, relinquishing the glass eye—show consistent motive deepening under pressure. The final renunciation of the relic is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she walks unprotected into uncertainty.

The final renunciation—leaving truth for reckoning, not retrieval—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: her name as ash, now compost. No safety-hedging; her flaws (isolation, mistrust) directly enable her quiet sabotage.

    The coachman’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, discipline, and philosophy manifest through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., slowing horses by stillness, not command). His contradictions (control vs. surrender, memory vs. distillation) operate simultaneously, not sequentially. The passenger’s silent burden is intuited without intrusion, preserving single-POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)

Her reincarnation memory isn’t exposition but scar tissue that actively shapes present action. Contradictory impulses—mourning vs. midwifery, preservation vs. genesis—operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his whimsy clashes with his yearning for connection, and his profession as a ghostwriter isolates him even as he channels others’ intimacy. His final dissolution into the temple’s pulse feels earned because his emotional arc (frayed → reconfigured) aligns with concrete micro-choices: packing the spiral, walking barefoot, inscribing names. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; his transformation avoids tidy resolution by becoming ambient presence rather than achieving personal reunion. The flaw: secondary characters exist only as off-page echoes, but this fits Track A scope.

Her final choice to touch the killer’s hand emerges from her lived epistemology of texture over sight. The killer’s motivation—preserving masks to stave off erasure—is psychologically credible and thematically resonant, avoiding villain cliché.

The copper nail and decoded stanza aren’t just symbols; they’re tools that constrain and enable her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s “fiercely gentle” contradiction operates in-scene through embodied choices—pressing palms to bark, touching Kael’s wrist—not abstraction. Her motivation (“patch holes in the soul”) drives every action and culminates in a renunciation that costs her safety but affirms her method. Kael’s arc from spite to “seedling” is credibly pressured by Elira’s consistency and the orchard’s will, not sentiment. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their flaws (his iron grief, her reckless idealism) shape tactics and closure without safety-hedging.

The final exchange with the girl crystallizes his arc without sentimentality, embodying “gleaned redemption” as lived practice.

Her reverence-as-static and love of “absurdity” feel character-specific, not diagnostic. The final sketching of glider mods shows credible endurance with visible cost: voice cracked, body spent, yet forward momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line walker’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and ritual action, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to preserve wisdom’s echo—is consistent and intensified by the setting’s fragility. The duality of her mask reflects a credible internal contradiction between discipline and mystery, made visible in micro-choices like kneeling without tools or chants.

His micro-choices—arranging driftwood, dragging chalk—are ritualized acts of futility that embody his struggle without self-diagnosis. Emotion is rendered through tactile sensation (chalk-dust fingerprints, static taste) rather than labels. His renunciation of memory itself becomes an Earned Stasis with visible cost: tears without context, footprints already softening.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)

Every micro-choice (kneeling, whispering, leaving the tooth) aligns with her renunciation of vengeance in favor of redemptive architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith’s motivation—preserving wonder as emotional nutrient—is embodied through tactile, specific actions (collecting shards by “emotional temperature,” sketching glyphs that “taste like cinnamon”) rather than abstract declaration. His peripherally focused gaze isn’t just stated but enacted: he avoids direct sight to prevent blindness, letting intuition stitch meaning from glimmers. The final renunciation—leaving the timer broken yet fulfilled—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: years of solitary labor, no audience, only a pocketful of humming quartz. No diagnostic label-speak; his interiority remains poetic yet concrete, rooted in light physics and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her contradiction between duty and personal grief manifests in micro-choices (lighting the lamp for herself) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)

The final equation H = Σ(ΔI • R) crystallizes her arc without sentimentality, and the cost—accepting ongoing decay while enabling communal breath—is visible in cracked walls still sloping. Contradictory impulses (restoration vs. revelation) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)

The scratched-out photo and inscription trigger no epiphany but “confirmation,” aligning with his established method. Final renunciation—carrying peace, not proof—earns closure with visible cost: he abandons legend-chasing for quiet witness.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    The seed collector’s motivation—preserving living tradition, not relics—is embodied in her calloused hands and patient posture, not stated abstractly.

Their micro-choices—offering fulgurite, tracing knots—carry visible cost: time, snow, silence—and crystallize a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The traveler’s motivation—mapping absence as a form of orientation—is deeply embodied and consistent, driving every micro-choice (folding the crane, writing vividly, tucking it beneath roots).

They did not hope. They mapped.”) is an Earned Stasis that forecloses emotional resolution in favor of disciplined witness, with visible cost: solitude that “shimmers” but never heals. Contradictory impulses—longing vs. discipline, presence vs. absence—act simultaneously without tidy synthesis.

His flaw (perfectionism as penance) directly shapes every action and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses his old identity with palpable cost: the end of 43 years of ritual. The rake inscription functions not as deus ex machina but as catalyst for a shift long implied by his bone-deep weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear manifests as physical vibration, memory as “toxic film negatives,” and agency culminates in the visceral act of “unbosoming.” Motivation (“to trick fear into revealing its weakness”) drives every choice, escalating logically to the climax where he confronts Fear as a reflection of himself. The whispering advisor functions less as a secondary character and more as an externalized aspect of his psyche, avoiding relationship-based pitfalls.

The absence of secondary characters sharpens focus on his solitary crucible, and his micro-choices (e.g., singing a dirge instead of a lullaby) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains contradictory and physically grounded.

Her unlived life recognition upon the fourth bug’s release is earned by prior emotional groundwork, not epiphany. Flaws are consistent: her passivity (“conductor asleep”) becomes active surrender only at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
