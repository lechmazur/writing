    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied through her scientific reflex meeting practical repair, showing contradictory impulses (researcher vs. sweeper) acting simultaneously. The progression from "flamboyant fireworks at data" to patient dust-tracing demonstrates earned change through prior causality. Micro-choices—pinning plastic, placing the slide, distributing tasks—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (abandoning drama for incremental progress). Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward abstraction ("preprocesses reality by habit") but recovers through immediate sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glass artist's motivation (discovering purpose in pauses) operates largely through reflection and metaphor rather than dramatized conflict of competing impulses. The teacher's rival as antagonist remains off-stage; the protagonist's plan to expose him through frost-patterns and the canyon's testimony feels more allegorical than psychologically urgent. Embodied emotion appears in scattered gestures (kneeling, breath held, glass rod singing), but the interiority often defaults to elevated abstraction ("purpose lived in pauses because pauses were doors"). The final choice—fusing the ledger into a window for frost-translation—arrives without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses another path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through actions—building the lattice, conducting movements, walking the riverbank. Interiority shows purposeful specificity ("sorrow cools sharp, but remembrance warms diffuse") and the ferry drowning backstory anchors present choices. However, internal contradiction remains abstract rather than acted simultaneously in scene; the narrator reflects *about* conflict more than *enacting* competing impulses under pressure. The final gesture of pocketing gratitude and carrying the case home reads as Earned Stasis but lacks visible micro-choices that foreclose a live alternative path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The undertaker's interiority is richly specific—"measures days by the weight of names," "inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets how to reverse"—and the embodied stakes ("grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry") anchor motivation. The final renunciation ("I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid") earns the endurance path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the shift from reactive observer to active agent arrives late, and some micro-choices in the library feel driven more by the manual's instruction than by contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is consistent and her "gently persistent" trait shapes multiple choices (pairing teens with elders, refusing to name donors). Interior access is sparse but the communal "we" POV limits deep contradiction. The teens' arc from "wired on fear and pride" to placing "hunger in the middle and ego at the fringe" offers meaningful change, though it is told more than dramatized. Embodied emotion appears occasionally ("chin high, silence ringing harder than any alarm"), but much interiority remains abstract or summary.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's spiritual curiosity and past-life mirror-maker identity are embodied through concrete actions (camera setup, breath work, the vial). Internal contradiction between measuring/hoarding light versus giving emerges clearly in the glass-room memory. However, the epiphany about unused love stored in "held breath" arrives through metaphoric assertion rather than through a dramatized mistake or struggle that forces the realization. The encounter with the passing man feels gestural rather than a choice that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and maintained throughout—lyric, image-dense, consistently filtering perception through design and memory. The micro-choices (pressing the shard, following the bridge underwater, putting the shard to tongue) alter tactical engagement with the environment and advance the encounter with grief. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between designing exits for grief versus creating labyrinths that perpetuate it, though this could be sharpened with more embodied struggle. The final acceptance ("the cost is welcome if I can read its texture") feels slightly abstract; grounding it in a concrete gesture visible on the page would have strengthened the earned-stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's "chained liberator" identity and patient strategic approach come through consistently, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The phrase "staggering grace" recurs as description rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her motivations are declared ("She came to plant resilience") but the cost of her choices—the weight of the vow—is asserted more than dramatized through micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. The chain functions more as metaphorical marker than constraint that genuinely shapes her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is dramatized through concrete actions (building devices, testing the bowl on the diver), and the backstory betrayal anchors the present quest with visible emotional cost. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("tone is what my work worships," "cells divide") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to "teach people to hear the prelude to rupture" reads as resolving the personal wound too cleanly, without a visible renunciation or forfeiture that would charge the ending with greater cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates a clear, consistent core identity (portrait thief of illuminated moments) with embodied choices throughout—using the jar, reading flowers, unlocking the door. Internal texture appears in lines like "I remembered his lesson: illuminated moments are not light, but the astonishment that light allows," though this tilts toward epiphany-statement rather than contradictory impulse. The mentor's transformation from rumor to body and the protagonist's final realization ("I knew what I had always stolen") provide arc, but the change feels more conceptual than viscerally earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen's interiority is dense and distinctive—his habit of narrating mundane tasks reveals character through action. However, his motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" remains largely asserted rather than tested by genuine internal conflict. The micro-choices (arranging glass shards, pressing the bookmark) are present but don't force him to sacrifice competing goods with visible cost. The imagined technician who left the bookmark adds texture but stays ornamental rather than creating pressure on Arlen's present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and driven by professional skill ("I cataloged fears like injuries"), and the discovery that his identity was stolen creates genuine internal conflict. The motivation to prove vulnerability as power shows embodied through trembling hands steadied by breath counts. However, the brother's appearance on the roof feels insufficiently prepared—his thinness and donated coat are told rather than shown through prior choice-pressure. The reconciliation happens through dialogue summary ("He apologized without excuses; I answered without armor") rather than dramatized micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The oracle's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—touching stone, noting silences—and her motivation to map silence remains consistent. The courier's arc from fear to understanding is earned through witnessing her method, with his decision to preserve the scroll creating visible internal conflict. However, the oracle's mild obsession is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and her bleeding fingers near the end feel more symbolic than psychologically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The robot janitor's interiority is specific and embodied through sensory particulars ("warmth I do not have," frost trailing sensors). Internal contradiction surfaces when the protagonist claims "remarkably composed" status while simultaneously questioning thoughts' origins and performing unauthorized violin experiments across loops. Micro-choices accumulate meaningfully—placing the broom aside, lifting the bow, choosing to keep sweeping—each foreclosing paths with visible cost. The final renunciation ("I catch what falls off them, and I return it to wherever it meant to go") earns its stance through prior causality, though the arc could land with sharper cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The registrar's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—pocketing the lens, reading doodles, mounting the bandstand—and internal contradiction surfaces when they confess eavesdropping while claiming to serve transparency. The final choice to expose themselves publicly is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of silent judgment with visible cost ("they can decide if the ledgers deserve me"). Minor diction slips into elevated register ("cryptic doodles...ambiguously clear") occasionally blur the POV's working-class specificity, but the core arc of cowardice-to-honesty remains grounded in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine dresser demonstrates consistent interiority through embodied choices—polishing marbles, kneeling to confess to the fountain, offering soil to the vine. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator admits to "mended deception" yet maintains pragmatic control, creating genuine complexity. The final stance (trust as "the last thing to polish") feels earned through the accumulation of small ritual choices, though the resolution trends slightly abstract. Micro-choices under pressure are present throughout, particularly in the trimming scene where acceptance of withering competes with the impulse to preserve.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jae is consistently characterized through concrete action—tuning gantries, pulling levers, whispering to the station—and his obsession with sideways time manifests in specific micro-choices (fashioning the probe, inverting fields). His internal contradiction between the obliging mechanic role and the boundary-pushing theorist creates productive tension. The ending choice to "just touch the history" and accept "proof arrived as an affection" shows earned renunciation with visible cost (he withholds his doubled self-sighting), though the cost could land more sharply on the page. Minor: some interiority leans slightly abstract ("temporal" rather than showing confused clock behavior), keeping this out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The musician's interiority is consistently voiced through lyric perception ("inspiration here is more a tide than a blaze"), and micro-choices under pressure are present (shouldering the door, tilting the lantern, raising the baton). However, the protagonist remains reactive—following instructions decoded from the program rather than generating goal-driven decisions that narrow options through internal conflict. The final act of conducting silence feels more like ritual compliance than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, and no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently embodied through concrete imagery—"small stone star," "smudge," "margins"—and the choice to voice the lie aloud is earned by prior circling. The oracle's "peripherally aware" trait reads as genuine perceptual signature. Minimal deduction for the slightly over-articulated final reflections ("some certainties must sway forever") that flirt with theme-summary, though they remain anchored in the scene's metaphor system.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses act in scene: religiously skeptical yet tracking patterns through psychic calls, pursuing truth while denying belief. Interiority is embodied through physical sensation—"my palms intelligent," "weight does not lie when your hands tremble"—and micro-choices (turning the wheel, opening the valve) carry visible cost. The father's death backstory is extensive (~20% of text) but anchors present action through the valve wheel and constrains the final choice to forgive and open the line. Minor deduction for diagnostic phrasing "drowsy alertness, a poised fatigue" that approaches label-speak, though it's offset by the physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chronicle keeper's interiority is dominated by lyric description rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. We see declaration of an oath ("sworn to witness change without judgment") and sensory immersion, but no on-page moment where competing desires force a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. The narrator remains observational throughout; the final lines restate the passive stance without dramatizing a path foreclosed. Embodied emotion is present in atmospheric texture but never tests the keeper's stated neutrality against a specific pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently embodied through musical choices that track emotional states—shifting kalimba pulse to match Ada's tapping, placing the locket on the guitar body. Ada's arc from guarded grief to "cautious exuberance" is earned through the eclipse sequence and the narrator's adaptive presence. Minor deduction: the narrator's professional competence lacks a visible struggle or mistake that would complicate the therapeutic work under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian is portrayed through consistent action and embodied perception—touching objects, reading fragments, listening to walls—with clear motivation to collect stories. Interior life is concrete and particular ("porous, letting other lives flow through"), though the interiority sometimes edges toward lyric label rather than contradictory impulse. The final choices (rearranging shelves, returning the disk, whispering to the axis) are earned by prior causality and foreclose paths with visible cost, but the character remains more a vessel than a figure wrestling with internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("I move people like water, letting gravity and rumor pull them where truth sits waiting"). Embodied contradiction appears in the decision to take the specs to the sea rather than trade them, driven by the desire to transpose life into a new key. The fortune-writer's "accidental prophecy" trait generates prior mistakes (the fisherman/lightbulbs) that earn the final orchestration. Minor slip: the keeper's motivations remain underdeveloped, though she functions primarily as pressure rather than full co-agent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Father Ilario's method is consistently embodied through his physical handling of tools and spatial positioning, and his choice to let the whisper "speak to its reflection" demonstrates interior contradiction resolved through concrete action. Mara's arc from possession-target to self-naming is earned through the loop pedal's accumulation and her husband's grounding touch. The possession itself reads more as symbolic device than dramatized opponent with genuine tactical adaptation, limiting the felt struggle. Interiority remains controlled and specific throughout, though the whisper's motivations stay abstract until the palette moment.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fortune-cookie writer POV is concrete and sustained, with internal contradiction between wanting to be heard and accepting cryptic silence. Embodied moments work well: "my palm warms the shell until the rooms in it loosen their doors." However, the character never makes a genuine choice under pressure—they describe mapping memories and conducting silence without dramatizing tradeoffs or costs that foreclose an option. The transformation is told (understanding fortunes were breath instructions) rather than earned through on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is densely rendered through embodied perception ("my shadow refused it"), but much of the piece traffics in abstraction—"periodically eternal," "labyrinth of self"—that relies on poetic claim rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. The final choice to "lower, a grain at a time" and walk rather than fly reads as earned renunciation with visible cost (surrendering flight, erasing the seed), yet the journey feels more like guided meditation than character under pressure making micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation remains coherent but the stakes feel contemplative rather than urgent, limiting the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior state is embodied through physical sensation ("felt the backwardness enthrall her scars like a tide unwinding") and her fear of numbness is concrete. The journey from emotional frost to thaw is earned through the cavern work. Minor slip: "She had come afraid her students would soon stop feeling, yet she had already stopped without noticing" articulates the realization too cleanly, edging toward diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to carry the needle and teach differently shows visible cost in her altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm recorder's professional identity is distinctive and drives micro-choices (decoy charts, coded message), with embodied contradiction—"credibly curious" versus "nights ask for restraint." Internal conflict operates in scene when they note "serenity and threat balanced like two needles." The lateral escape and the final stance show earned endurance with visible cost (leaving work behind, accepting witness status), though the interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("integrity is a barometer").

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet POV carries a consistent perceptual signature—filtering the energy beings and grotto through metaphor and pattern. Motivation (discovering time's texture) is clear and drives the descent, the rope-handling, and the engagement with the being. The final vow ("ethically playful, keep mercy quick") and the mirrored past confrontation show internal contradiction—heroic knots vs. present humility—but the turn from "seem heroic" to "braid it into present strength" feels more asserted than enacted with visible struggle on the page. Interiority leans abstract ("violet arithmetic," "time's grain") without enough embodied sensation to anchor stakes at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The violinist remains more symbol than character; interior life is sparse and decisions feel pre-determined rather than hard-won. The gathering of children and elders creates relational pressure, but their presence doesn't force the protagonist into contradictory impulses or visible struggle. The final action—lifting the bowl to "hear a map drawing itself"—registers as conceptual assertion rather than embodied choice with felt cost. Lark's questions provide some external friction, but the protagonist's answers arrive fully formed without hesitation or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivations are clear and consistent—professional thoroughness and a desire to witness genuine transformation. Interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception ("the resin breath raised stray hairs") and contradictory impulses (selling counterfeits while wanting authentic change). Rhea's internal conflict between cartographic precision and empathic connection drives her choices. Minor deduction: the client's transformation feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices, though the final image of her breathing "with the patience of an animal" earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is declared but not tested through embodied contradiction; her "cautious exuberance" is told rather than shown via competing impulses in scene. Jun receives trait labels ("whimsically attentive") without behavioral specificity that would distinguish him from generic librarian types. The granddaughter's arrival and speech are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening what could be a pivotal emotional beat. No micro-choices under pressure force visible tradeoffs that would demonstrate character hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and particular ("boldly sympathetic, a flaw and a craft"), and the arc from isolation to grafting shows contradiction and cost. However, the emotional work relies heavily on abstraction—"luminescent ache," "tenderized by strangers"—rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to "tend the arbor" feels inevitable but lacks a foregrounded visible trade-off in the closure beat itself. Secondary characters (Farrin, baker, diver) apply immediate pressure but remain gestural.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear motivation ("find the place where echoes are born") with embodied interiority throughout. Micro-choices around the pendant's use are specific and character-consistent: "I borrowed from the giant's nap, one sigh's worth, then another." The closing decision to release the larva rather than trap it earns the moral stance with visible cost ("Time borrowed must be repaid"). Minor slip: the illustrator's patience-versus-curiosity tension could have been dramatized in one more concrete dilemma before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conjurer's motivation to understand his sister's disappearance through emotion-as-mathematics is present but often told rather than shown through pressure-driven choices. The flashback of the sister teaching fractions is anchored and does tilt present stance, staying within BRR allowances. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulation ("emotion can be graphed," "sorrow approaches a limit") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The final choice to carry the theorem without solving it reads as renunciation with cost, but earlier beats lack the micro-choices that would make the arc feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crawl space dweller shows consistent interior motivation (becoming visible through service) and embodied action (felt pads, cache opening, chalk marks). However, interiority relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("fear is a lantern that reveals and burns") rather than character-specific contradiction under pressure. The girl functions primarily as a need rather than a pressure-generating presence; their non-interaction prevents relationship dynamics from testing the protagonist's commitment. The cache-driven solution feels methodical but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path at closure—he retreats "heart big as a boiler" without material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal contradiction between control and release is embodied throughout—her hands tying knots that sigh loose, her standing still to let teaching find her. The progression from arranging to witnessing is earned through repeated micro-choices (stepping aside from the jasmine-hop braid, keeping a ledger of what she did not force). Interiority remains concrete and character-specific ("the old impulse to fix everything arrived, buttoned, polished, persuasive"). Minor slip: the community-hall speech risks slight over-articulation of the arc, though it stops short of pure explication.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular ("paint became the only clean water I trusted"), and the partnership with the keeper crystallizes organically through shared weight ("heat moved through us the way tides reason"). The mother apparition arrives without sufficient causal preparation, yet the final pact and its consequences feel earned through the brooch exchange and lamp-tending commitment. Embodied contradictions appear in the keeper's wry earnestness and the narrator's simultaneous distrust and need for communion, grounding choices in felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The clairvoyant guide and baker pilgrim carry distinct interior textures—the guide's prophetic failure ("I did not see it coming") and the pilgrim's sensory memory of flour anchor their choices. The pearl's refusal of the guide ("my hand strays into a chord that empties me of certainty") embodies a credible reversal with visible cost. However, the pilgrim's motivation remains largely告知 rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; his laugh at the end asserts understanding without on-page struggle. Internal contradiction is present but not sustained under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation is concrete and embodied through sensory work (valve-turning, window-tapping), with interiority filtered through the archival lens ("reactively visionary"). The woman's desire to "leave traces that do not wash away" creates sufficient pressure. Minor slip: her backstory about exile feels asserted rather than dramatized through present micro-choices, and the archivist's internal contradiction (waiting vs. compiling) remains more thematic than behavioral. The ending choice to gift the valve is earned and forecloses the museum-object path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's identity as a "meticulous route mapper" with "analytically artistic" qualities is established through declaration rather than embodied choice. Interior states remain abstract ("trembling certainty") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final move—folding maps, breathing, stepping forward—lacks visible cost or a hierarchy of competing values that would earn the transformation. Competence is asserted but not tested through mistakes or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs"), with embodied emotion ("my hand wrote it confidently") and contradictory impulses (skeptic who remains, offers tea). The motivation to "sculpt space for reflection without surrendering reason" drives micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is somewhat dramatized in the tile scene, though the final shift toward belief feels slightly under-earned in causal terms. Lio functions as secondary pressure but his arc is light; the relationship crucible could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The immortal narrator exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—angles whispering rebellion, collecting echoes—and the desire to understand "after goodbye" drives the intrigue with Lio. The final exchange ("might forgive me later") suggests genuine character friction with visible cost (the immortal's boredom gains "edges"). However, the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("goodbye is a road," "purpose is the closest thing to mortality") that reads more like thematic annotation than embodied contradiction under pressure. Lio's arrival and participation feel somewhat passive; his "face that had sworn not to forgive" is declared but his agency in the corridor remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("liquefies rigid thinking in me with a sound"), with embodied contradiction between inherited con-artistry and the desire for fairness. The micro-choices under pressure—singing low while the director peers, the wrist-squeeze acknowledgment—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal conflict between father's "carnival math" and the protagonist's "inverse function" drives the helping choice, though the final epiphany ("feel the new vowel of fairness arrive") edges toward label-speak without full embodied grounding in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer's motivation is coherent and embodied through concrete actions (carrying notepad, measuring lamp hum, writing invented histories). Interiority remains specific to the character's craft—"I learned to listen through ink"—and the final renunciation ("my pages will be only paper") lands with visible cost. Minor gap: the choice to create invented histories rather than record actual silence feels asserted more than dramatized through an on-page dilemma. No second character pressure to test status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's perceptual signature—"filters reality differently," seeing "texture of memories" rather than truth—is well embodied through concrete micro-choices: handling the poison label until "fingertips taste bitter," following gaps in sentences, layering overheard scraps. The widow confrontation shows contradictory impulses (offering the label as both gift and verdict) with visible cost. Minor deduction: the widow's trembling hand and whispered excuse feel slightly formulaic at the peak beat, and the narrator's erasure premise sometimes edges toward label-only interiority ("the certificate made it illegal for me to remember") without full dramatization of that constraint shaping a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The myth buster's interiority is highly metaphorical but consistent—his perceptual filter (maps of sighs, shells as compass, jokes as defense) shapes every choice. Embodied emotion appears in moments like the shell warming and his quiet laughter, though some beats lean toward label ("gloomy cheerfulness") rather than contradictory impulses in action. The final renunciation—packing the cello, bowing to the dome—carries visible cost (he leaves without full resolution), but the stakes remain abstract enough that the forfeiture feels more thematic than visceral. Internal contradiction is present (courting the sky while fearing failure) but could press harder in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nessa's dual allegiance creates consistent internal tension through embodied micro-choices: pressing the chip into wet paint, meeting muralists under tarps, offering the trade with visible risk. The brother subplot adds genuine relational pressure that complicates her choices without becoming a second protagonist. Interiority remains concrete ("hope does not erase desperation, but it teaches it to sing on key") and the final ceasefire gesture carries earned cost. Minor deduction for some therapeutic phrasing ("hopeful desperation made me brave, or foolish") that slightly softens peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied—"the way you become when every answer feels like a door to another losing" registers as character-particular rather than generic. Internal conflict surfaces in the tension between documenting extinction and hoping to prevent it, with micro-choices (unpacking vials, checking focus) revealing values under pressure. The mother's legacy as Nightwatch provides motivation that tilts present action without becoming expository. Minor deduction: the narrator's emotional progression feels slightly smoothed; the throat-tightening moment near the end could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The artisan's interiority is concrete and embodied through the water-bowl method, her wrist-taps, and her spatial listening. Her blindness constrains and enables choices throughout, with visible micro-adjustments under pressure (calling for more bowls, patching code midair). The final smile toward the harbor and the drone landing "warm with work" deliver an earned moment of rest after demonstrated competence and struggle. Minor: Mirel remains functional but flat, serving as hands without distinct interior friction or status tension.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atlas editor's interiority is rendered through concrete, particular observation—"I am not brave, but I am subtly confident in the way hard winters shape a person"—and micro-choices (striking the match, turning the valve) carry embodied tension. The falcon functions as external pressure and the phrasebook as inherited constraint, both filtering through the protagonist's stance. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between fear of taming and trust in naming, paid off when the editor copies lines "and let my wit rest, unneeded in the quiet." Minor deduction for the ending's slight drift toward abstraction ("let the atlas breathe differently") where a concrete image would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell tuner's motivation is coherent and embodied through ritual action rather than introspection. His infinitely patient trait is claimed but not tested with meaningful cost—he works for two days with no visible struggle or sacrifice. The townspeople who return lack individuated voices or contradictory impulses; the mother's wariness dissolves without friction. Internal conflict is absent; the tuner's calm certainty never wavers under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"panic paddles my ribs," "fingers numb in the cold"—and the signature move of "overriding instinct" by becoming stillness anchors character under pressure. The micro-choices (unsnarling line, positioning transmitter, exhaling tones) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to rescue and memory. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between panic and stillness, though the move toward stillness is less contested than enacted. The final renunciation or endurance is legible but leans slightly toward performed competence without deeper cost to selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and embodied through metaphor ("the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son"), with micro-choices visible in carrying the lattice, climbing the stairs, and positioning it over the drain. However, the protagonist's motivations remain abstract—"chasing hush" and "threading a labyrinth with my own story"—without grounding in concrete wants or fears that face a visible trade-off. The final act (setting the lattice over the drain to let "the muffled thing beneath surrender") reads as symbolic rather than a credible choice with felt cost, weakening the sense of a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper's interiority is sustained through concrete sensory choices ("warm despite her winter," "pricked me awake without drawing blood") and micro-decisions under the ghost bride's coaching. The ghost bride's motivation—repaying a river rescue—arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, weakening causal grounding. Internal contradiction appears when the keeper promises "like a fool" yet the vow feels "older than my breath," a tension that enriches rather than muddles. The final renunciation (ghosting the trader's knock) enacts a value hierarchy with visible cost, meeting the length's closure demand.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's voice is distinct and her motivation (restore the harbor) is clear, but interior contradiction is largely absent—she moves through the labyrinth with poetic confidence rather than embodied struggle. The final choice (leaving the plate, carrying the tether) feels thematic rather than earned by on-page cost that forecloses a path. Embodiment is present ("metal sings against hemp") but emotional states are often asserted through lyric labels ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The piece tilts toward accumulative/textural mode, where reflection and description dominate over moment-to-moment decision pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently voice-specific ("faith had not been lost, only interrupted") and embodied choices appear in several beats (rebuilding the gnomon, returning objects). Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between documenting and restoring, though the resolution toward tending feels earned by the walking-and-listening micro-choices. Secondary character Sami remains functional but one-note; his shovel-knot simile is vivid but he doesn't apply independent pressure. Motivation shifts organically from documentation to restoration to tending, with visible cost in the abandoned departure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinctly embodied through sensory perception ("ebony clipboard warming," "grit cling to my knees") and shows a coherent professional lens filtering experience. The motivational arc—creating a pseudonym to protect someone who "no longer claims the letter of their name"—sustains pressure through concrete micro-choices (testing names "the way dentists test nerves"). However, the final decision to withhold mailing ("I step back, not dropping yet") reads as manufactured hesitation rather than an earned cost that forecloses a path; the protagonist's internal contradiction never crystallizes into a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and voice-driven ("I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past when dressed like a jester"), and the choice to stitch the falsified routes shows agency under pressure. However, the protagonist remains observational through most beats; the keeper and the conspirators act off-page, reducing on-page struggle. The final act—tucking the embroidery away and accepting blame—reads as renunciation with cost, but the emotional stakes feel muted because we never see the narrator wrestle with competing desires in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and voice-consistent, with embodied emotion ("fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling"). However, the motivation to "find the moment before deciding" remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The wound that "heals in moonlight and reopens at dawn" is poetic but never constrains a present action with visible cost. The final choice to "share the hinge and let it breathe us" is earned thematically but lacks a decisive forfeiture or on-page alteration of tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The translator's motivation is concrete and embodied through the coral fragment and cast-reading; the shrewdly innocent boy's dual-labeled boats crystallize the conflict. The mother's struggle with the Reka word for shelter and the uncle's arrival create genuine pressure. However, the translator remains more conduit than agent—observations dominate over difficult choices that foreclose paths. The boy's waking grin is charming but the translator's arc lacks a visible cost or renunciation that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("rediscover lost joy") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Interior monologue is stylized and dense but lacks moment-to-moment embodied emotion under pressure—lines like "I am a mural artist, vivid by temperament" read as self-narration rather than lived contradiction. The final choice to "paint the gaps tomorrow" acknowledges continuation but does not foreclose a path with visible cost on the page. Micro-choices (threading film, holding the shard as color key) are present but feel directed by the concept rather than character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The restorer's interiority is vivid and embodied ("ribs," "sleeves," "hands doubted"), with methodical playfulness shown in concrete micro-choices (tapping, rolling the coin, timing breath). Motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" drives the questioning pattern and opens vulnerability at the crack. The progression from professional task to personal admission ("fear that a perfect restoration erases the hands that kept living") is earned through the garden's reciprocal pressure. Minor slip: emotional calibration is smooth and articulate throughout; no degradation under discovery stress.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinctive and consistently "candidly cryptic," filtering the world through a poetic lens that collapses metaphor and literalism. Interiority remains present throughout, with micro-choices (keeping the seed, opening the greenhouse doors, speaking in ellipses) that reflect values under pressure. However, the narrator's agency often blurs into collective action ("we"), and the individual emotional stakes—fear, doubt, cost—are muted by the lyric register, which treats crisis as aesthetic material rather than visceral threat. The final choice (singing the rights clause, planting ENTER) feels more like a performed conclusion than a character turn with visible personal forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The insomniac poet's interiority is rendered through lyric metaphor rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist's shift from vigilance to tending is asserted through poetic declaration ("shyly unstoppable") rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The Gardener's arrival and the treaty-signing feel more like allegorical fulfillment than character-driven pressure. Interior conflict remains abstract; we never see the poet wrestle with a concrete choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glass-orchid caretaker's interior is richly textured through specific, embodied perception ("mothwing of cooled thunder," "breath in time with the trembling crack"), and the core motive—stewardship without romance—shapes micro-choices consistently. The climactic repair sequence shows contradictory impulses (fear of failure vs. commitment) acting simultaneously with visible cost: "my heartbeat falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice." However, the protagonist's actions remain mostly successful without meaningful struggle or tradeoff that forecloses a path; the chime heals, the name returns, and no loss accompanies the victory, weakening the sense of earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist displays clear interior motivation—restoring trust through linguistic artistry—and the reconciliation with Lio is earned through the "symphonies of truth" composition. However, the character's "carefully reckless" trait is stated more than dramatized in choices with visible cost. The emotional arc from isolation to collaboration reads cleanly, but interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("heart fugueing," "shoulders turning toward one another") that softens embodied stakes. The final joint revision of the coda provides a credible change with relational cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The machinist protagonist shows occupation-specific perception (chain pacing, valve tuning) and makes on-page choices under pressure. Interior voice is distinct and consistent ("machines are only honest when they are allowed to care"), with embodied contradictions visible in the trembling hands and "delicate balance of receiving and refusing gratitude." However, the decisive choice to tune the gates feels more like technical problem-solving than a choice that forecloses a path with visible personal cost; the protagonist's values are dramatized but the final adjustment doesn't force a genuine trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivations are concrete and embodied—training pigeons, mapping dust, preserving songs—and the internal conflict between past betrayal and new trust is consistently dramatized through micro-choices (sending Lark, climbing the beam, tying the meteorite chip). Interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains image-driven ("My past leans in with its counterfeit smiles"). The final choice to trust the violinist is earned through the accumulation of small acts and the physical gesture of sending the chip with Lark, though the secondary character (the violinist) remains slightly under-developed as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly textured and consistently particular—"featherly determined" reads as lived rather than label-only, and the focus on pattern-reading through grain and codes reflects character logic. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; the climactic choice is to "keep the distance" rather than close it, which reads as renunciation but lacks embodied cost or visible foreclosure of an alternative path. Emotional states are poetic but occasionally abstract ("the ache," "articulate love") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father exists as backstory and symbol, never pressuring the narrator on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior is consistent—landscape astrology as lens, the desire for belonging—and micro-choices (holding the feather, synchronizing breath) are embodied. However, the final realization ("belonging is a rhythm you listen for") edges toward label-speak rather than embodied discovery, and the emotional arc resolves too tidily without sufficient on-page cost or contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The relationship with Rin is collaborative but lacks pressure-testing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sea-foam recollectionist functions as a lens rather than a character who makes contested choices under pressure. Interior life is present but largely contemplative; the protagonist observes, listens, and interprets without facing meaningful internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The shepherd's prior choice is dramatized in vision, but the recollectionist's own agency remains interpretive rather than transformative. Embodied emotion and micro-choices are minimal; the piece relies on atmospheric interiority that describes states rather than enacting contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The performer's interiority is consistent and voice-particular, filtered through a quasi-mathematical lens ("calculus of misrule," "counts dress like chance"). Motivation remains coherent throughout: orchestrating serendipity through careful observation and micro-interventions. However, the protagonist's agency is largely passive observation and light manipulation rather than choices under genuine pressure with competing costs. The janitor and girl respond predictably to prompts, and no internal contradiction forces a difficult trade-off that would elevate the characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tide dancer protagonist has a clear professional identity and exile motivation, with embodied interiority ("my body remembered, even here, how a pivot on wet stone makes meaning"). However, the cartographer remains passive throughout—a vessel for the procedure rather than a character who makes choices under pressure. The protagonist's arc from exile to "vocation" is asserted rather than dramatized through a meaningful renunciation or trade-off with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor-dense reflection without concrete micro-choices that test competing impulses in the peak tattooing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glazier protagonist has a distinct perceptual signature (seeing the ferry ramp in the architect's sketches, reading ripples as counsel) and embodied gestures (polishing windows, throwing stones). Internal texture shows contradiction between wanting to preserve and accepting change, visible in the decision to sand old ferry boards into benches. The boy's question "can a window hold a family" and the narrator's answer demonstrate micro-choices under pressure. However, the final stance—arguing for the atrium to "breathe like the bay"—feels more declared than dramatized with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The firefighter's interiority is concrete and embodied through scarred hands, measured breath, and the physical weight of the box. Internal conflict surfaces in the tension between keeping the paper children and returning them, shown through "I could not bear you walking without them." The final choice to teach rather than merely return demonstrates character growth with visible cost (carrying the empty box, "lighter than guilt, heavier than air"). Minor deduction for the phrase "enlighten himself by reflecting deeply" which edges toward stated rather than shown internal process.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is highly specific and poeticized, with embodied sensory engagement (handling the gauge, breathing into bladders, arranging patterns). However, the "logical dreamer" trait remains largely asserted rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The villagers' sleepwalking is told rather than shown, and the final choice to teach the village feels more resolved than earned through visible internal conflict. The piece lacks genuine struggle between competing impulses at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartographer's interior is rendered through poetic compression rather than contradiction or choice under pressure. Motivation is consistent (vow to map what walls dream), but the protagonist observes and records rather than facing a dilemma that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "legacy's burden" moment and the hopscotch action show micro-choices, yet they do not create an internal conflict that narrows options. Embodiment is present ("I knelt," "I coaxed") but often filtered through lyric distance rather than visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and lyric-specific ("borrowed heartbeat, careful as a stranger picking up a sleeping child"), with embodied emotion through the tremor-matching-droplets moment. The motivation to persuade mirrors is clear and consistent, but the internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure remain thin—much of the middle unfolds as instruction-reception rather than resistance or cost-laden hesitation. The ending choice (keep singing, walk out steadier) arrives without visible forfeiture of a live alternative path, reading more as completion than renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The negotiator's interiority shows purposeful control—"operatively gentle," restraint without bruising—and micro-choices accumulate (asking children what they want, reframing redemption as shared work). Internal contradiction emerges when the general admits exhaustion with victories-as-funerals, grounded in embodied weariness rather than therapy-speak. The cast is large (two delegations, aide, general, soldier, children) but choreography remains mostly clear and pressure coheres around the singular stake of brokering peace through ritual modesty. No unmotivated leaps; the final promise to "anchor ideals in practice, day after day" follows from prior choices with visible cost (the provisional agreements, the annual return).

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's contradictory impulses—amoral yet philanthropic, financing drought yet claiming to preserve bird echoes—create genuine internal tension. Embodied moments like "eyes watered, a sentimental leak he would deny" show specificity, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract framing ("he kept echoes... because they could not indict him"). The final choice to leave as rain begins carries visible cost (the sting of salt, the lighter case) but remains somewhat conceptual rather than decisively altering options. Minor register drift into elevated diction at emotional peaks slightly flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chaste courtesan's motivation—defying conformity via ritual—is established, but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bodily poetic," "alarming serenity" as repeated descriptors rather than embodied contradiction). Micro-choices exist (kneeling, threading, descending) yet lack visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final bowl-setting reads as ritual completion without a felt trade-off that forecloses a personal path. Embodied emotion is sparse; the prose tells us she "knew" and "vowed" more than it shows contradictory desires colliding under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sorin's arc from scripting satirical puppet shows to implementing ethical reform is present but relies heavily on reflective declaration rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The shift feels sermonic—"we were pickpockets of grief"—rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The woman's entrance and stick-passing provide a credible turn, but her acceptance arrives without visible internal cost or hesitation. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke") instead of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrator's interiority is consistent—esoteric realist, building ephemeral signals—but remains largely observational rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is present (kneeling, resin bead), yet the closing "waited for history to answer gently" reads passive rather than a choice with visible cost. The reflection on overlooked keepers is anchored to present gestures, but the final stance crystallization lacks an earned renunciation or decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior texture and embodied craft knowledge throughout ("technically gentle" shown through action at the furnace and braids). The forgiveness arc is earned through the grandmother's bell backstory and the concrete final stance of listening. Minor: some internal contradictions blur motivation ("I had promised to return only after forgiving yourself" suggests external accountability, yet the piece reads as solitary reckoning). The protagonist's micro-choices (testing braids, clipping the card, steadying the frame) anchor pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is highly specific and consistent ("names are maps, and mine is a maze"), with embodied particulars like "communion of obsolete authority and my own hunger." The final choice to open the door and accept the path is motivated by the archive's recovered verb "to shepherd" and the protagonist's sustained dream-translation method. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("to transcend is not to escape") without micro-choices that visibly alter tactics in the moment, and the protagonist's flaws or contradictory impulses remain muted—most decisions feel inevitable rather than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frugal astronomer's voice is particular and consistent—"Frugality is a lens; it keeps only what you can see by the sky's grace"—with embodied priorities (counting oil, spare pencils, patient hours) that constrain on-page choices. Interior contradictions surface when the narrator mocks burnt-grain rites yet counts angles like a penitent, and the final vow to "repair pins, replace wires" crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost (oil when spare, hours when kinder than coin). Minor diagnostic slip: the reflective mode occasionally drifts toward thesis ("Attention is a currency dearer than silver") without always anchoring in micro-choice within two lines, but the ending choice remains earned and the voice never collapses into generic register.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is distinct and lyric-dense, with embodied perception ("spine learned to quarrel with waking," "prickles unwind"). Rell's motivation to release resentment is dramatized through cellular memory and physical reaction, though the transformation feels compressed—his kneeling and thread-loosening occur rapidly without visible struggle. The scheming pacifist's choices (guiding, touching, arranging encounters) are purposeful but operate more as facilitator than protagonist under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak, but the final shift in Rell lacks a micro-choice that forecloses a live option with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilen's internal stance—"not a mystic, just a worker of surfaces"—establishes a clear self-concept, and his micro-choices (steadying Noor by counting orchard seasons, remembering ladder weight) ground his decisions in embodied particulars. Noor's apprentice backstory motivates her presence but her interiority is thin; the dream itself is used rather than characterized. The closure choice to "teach holding" rather than trap emerges from prior micro-moves but arrives more as theme statement than earned internal shift with visible cost; Ilen's final gesture (offering the sextant) lacks contradictory impulse or internal friction. No therapy-speak or label-only emotions; embodiment is strong ("boots sunk in rime"), but the protagonist's arc reads more as execution of a plan than a journey through contradictory desires.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's quartz-eye mender identity, grief over the daughter, and cautious mentorship of Mira are embodied through concrete action—climbing, pruning, tying the ribbon—and the interiority ("I closed my fist over it until the quartz throbbed") carries contradictory weight without therapy-speak. The final choice to leave the tin unopened and graft with the ribbon enacts renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: Mira's voice and the narrator's occasionally converge in diction ("endearingly feisty" reads authorial rather than POV-particular), preventing full 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The curator's interiority shows some concrete anchoring—he feeds the cameo rainwater and secrets, presses it to the tree—but much of his motivation remains abstract ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet") rather than embodied. The choice to eat the dullest fruit arrives without clear internal contradiction or visible cost beyond a vague sense of complicity. The aunt's vanishing mid-lecture and her role as inherited inquiry are told more than dramatized, weakening the felt stakes of his final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The arcane linguist has a clear motivation and specific skills (reading catalog holes, warming diary pages), but interiority remains largely label-based ("carefully resourceful," "rescue missions") rather than embodied contradiction. The emotional progression feels smoothed: no genuine struggle between impulse and restraint appears on the page. The rescue of the apprentice happens through metaphor ("conjugations like ladders") without dramatized cost or visible failure along the way. The final stance ("we continue the rescue missions, but for ourselves") arrives as assertion rather than earned through contradictory choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "chimera twin discoverer" self-concept operates primarily as a metaphoric lens rather than a grounded psychological stance with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic constructions ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace") rather than embodied thought particular to this character. The final renunciation ("one hand letting go of the ledger while the other planted the empty jar") gestures toward split identity but arrives through conceptual assertion rather than earned tension between wants. Micro-choices exist (holding the card to light, pouring soil) but lack visible cost or foreclosed alternatives that would anchor agency.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist's motivation to translate confusion into clarity is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (loosening rope loops, counting wraps aloud, pressing the seal). His "warmly methodical" manner is embodied in action rather than merely declared. Internal contradiction could be sharper—he moves through each decision with calm confidence, lacking the visceral pull between competing impulses that would elevate this into the 8+ range. The ending choice (filing the ledger, adding a note) feels earned by prior causality but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapkeeper's interior is distinct and embodied through concrete gestures—echo chamber stone handling, breath-counting, finger-tracing ice scripts. Micro-choices accumulate purposefully: placing the stone, aligning it to flow, tapping in a circle. The final stance (tending the bloom, stone in hand, reading ice) emerges as earned endurance that forecloses wandering in favor of this learned motion. Agency reads as attention and technique under pressure, apt for the character's role, with visible cost in the sustained effort and knowledge burden.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The custodian's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied perception through retrocognition and the shard of hush. The arrival of Lio introduces relationship pressure, and the shared labor on the beacon feels earned. However, the protagonist's emotional arc remains somewhat externalized—we see actions and perceptions but limited internal contradiction or competing impulses under pressure. The final choice to remain custodian and the tears over his mother's pencil scratch land with warmth but feel more thematic than a character crucible with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is densely rendered with embodied sensory detail ("feather that remembered summers," "quill streaked with solar resin"). The central motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" drives a credible arc from self-doubt ("what if I was only a binder") to integration ("both" binder and page). However, the transformation hinges on a single moment of self-disclosure (plum anecdote) that feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is present but elliptical. Interior voice is consistent and particular, avoiding label-speak at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently filtered through craft-focused perception ("measuring the air with my feet," "filtered the burned smell from memory"), and the relationship with Lark creates productive pressure. However, the emotional stakes remain largely abstract—the fortress residents' "gravity of hopelessness" is told rather than embodied in choices. The final teaching moment ("how to lean out of sorrow without falling") edges toward therapy-speak without sufficient dramatized cost to earn it. Lark's agency is thin; she functions more as apprentice than co-actor with her own conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal-pool chronicler's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I listen the way I catalog reefs, warmly observant"), with embodied hesitation (tilting the jade cicada, holding breath). Internal conflict between staying and going is dramatized through sidelong seeing of multiple futures, each with texture. The final choice ("Yes, I will go inland") feels earned by the weight of prior reflection, though the POV remains slightly passive—decision arrives more from prolonged contemplation than from a moment that forces contradiction to act in scene. Micro-choices (studying barnacles, tilting the cicada) reveal hierarchy but the peak turn could apply more visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's claustrophobia and hunger for "intangibly tangible" quiet drive consistent, particular choices—climbing monthly, collecting silences in the doll, seeking one her father could understand. The final moment where father tastes the gilded hush and asks to redraw entrances shows earned change rooted in prior causality. Internal contradiction appears embodied: she fears doorlessness yet craves escape from walls. Minor slip: the phrase "I am made of exits" edges toward self-diagnostic articulation, though the surrounding embodied detail mostly sustains voice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gondola operator's interiority shows character-specific perception (storm glass reading, noise monitoring) and the mathematician receives embodied emotion through physical cues ("hands rest on her lap betrays turbulence," shoulders loosening). However, the operator's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" remains largely abstract—demonstrated through exposition about the singer's suicide and guild philosophy rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The mathematician's equation about grief feels more like a symbolic device than a lived struggle with visible micro-choices under pressure. Minor deduction for the therapeutic framing ("how to be held by it") that edges toward label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior is concrete and specific ("wisely adventurous, patient with ruins") with distinctive perceptual filters ("apples mirrored nebulae," "paint brittle as leaves in an archived autumn"). The decisive choice at closure—asking the system to leave the throne unbound, then accepting the duet governance with Quin—is earned by the established lore-keeper identity and resolves with visible cost (the chair stays "nobly empty"). However, Quin remains underwritten: introduced as "quick with cables and quicker with doubt" but given no contradictory impulses or micro-choices that complicate their consent to shared governance. The narrator's "old ache of libraries, the wish to keep options open" motivates refusal of singular rule, but the shift to duet feels convenient rather than tested by on-page friction between the two.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is consistent and character-particular, with embodied contradictions ("I am the one who burns bridges carefully"). The teaching moment with the first student dramatizes stance through micro-choices (counting seconds, widening the seam). However, the student remains abstract—"a girl and a crater"—and her arc feels more symbolic than psychologically specific. The narrator's motivation to "teach suffocating to breathe" stays at the level of poetic assertion rather than grounded in a personal wound or need that evolves under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied: "My thumbs shake," "The bolt fits...the metal knows the ritual." Internal conflict appears in lived contradiction—they are "virtuously mischievous" and simultaneously scarred by pyramid-scheme trauma, impulses that drive distinct on-page choices (volunteering for maintenance vs. prudent restraint). The final choice to volunteer delivery is earned by prior causality with visible cost (accepting the raise "like a tide" while insisting value is "only payable in trust and lungs"). Minor slip: some emotional progression reads slightly overarticulated ("I laugh, which sounds like a valve finding its note"), but it does not flatten the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-specific throughout, with embodied emotion ("my throat tightened") and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values (pocketing the crank, leaving the seal). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between shame and relief, and the final renunciation—choosing not to rebuild—feels earned by the confession's causal weight. Mother's deathbed instruction anchors motivation without exposition dump, and the caretaker's silent communication adds pressure without dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The knight's interiority is vivid and specific—his embodied wariness and measured breath ground the character. The mother backstory appears abruptly in the second half without prior seeding, weakening motivation clarity. The final choice (pressing the kernel to tongue) lacks visible internal conflict in the moment; the protagonist moves through beats with contemplative passivity rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is strong ("shivering bliss," visor unsnapped as "rite of honesty"), but the decisive act feels ordained rather than torn from competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and specific—"tactfully hopeful by practice, not nature" manifests in reading dust patterns and writing addenda. Internal contradiction operates through broken-heartedness paired with systematic care. The final choice to create the envelope and photograph the shelf shows agency with visible cost (vulnerability, hope extended into an unknown future). Minor slip: the counselor's fingerprints are inferred rather than dramatized, introducing a small convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation ("the tyranny of indifference") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction ("folding risk into routine like a note into worn denim") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final action feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices showing internal conflict. The museum guard detail and her self-description ("late, hungry, and useful") offer texture, but agency remains largely unopposed and the cost of her act is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist shows embodied commitment through repeated micro-choices (adjusting embouchure, feathering breath, sliding registers) that track the prophetic threat and constrain future options. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, anchored in sensory detail and the oath's pressure. Internal conflict registers in the tension between remembering the teacher and the instrument as "amulet against remembering," though the teacher's absence is felt more as texture than as a live contradiction forcing peak-beat choices. The final departure carries earned weight—options are foreclosed, the oath holds—but the cost remains more atmospheric than viscerally forfeited on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is consistent and poetic, but interiority remains largely contemplative rather than embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices appear (delaying the reach, arranging seeds into monuments), yet the pressure never forces a genuine internal conflict or renunciation with visible cost. Embodiment is present in "moss on my knees" and "ash from my hair," but emotional states read as serene throughout rather than contradictory under stress. The final realization "what emerges transformed always is the hearer" arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tinkerer's journey from "chasing exactness" to embracing "fidelity to the living irregular beat" is earned through concrete on-page choices—following the compass, timing the waterfall's rhythm, assembling the water clock. Internal contradiction appears in "uncertainly certain" and the tension between planning and improvisation, with embodied choices (counting spray beats, cleaning the hearth) that reflect character-particular perception. The final stance—building "a harbor where improvisations could anchor"—forecloses the rigid approach with visible cost (the burned workshop, the acceptance of uncertainty). Minor penalty for occasional abstraction ("befriend uncertainty") that edges toward label-speak, but the arc remains grounded in tactile problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently embodied through alchemical process and specific sensory detail. Internal contradiction operates effectively: refusing closure while demanding calibration, measuring grief through materials. The final choice—carrying the fused alloy rather than expecting resurrection—lands with visible cost tied to character logic. Minor penalty: some phrases ("memory that has learned to redeem itself") edge toward label-speak at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinctive and philosophically consistent ("gardener of untended laughter"), but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure—the modestly fearless stance remains decorative rather than forcing trade-offs. The woman who died mid-laughter arrives late and her arc (fear → joke-telling) compresses without visible cost or earlier setup. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("fear is a better teacher when it is asked to speak softly") rather than specific, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No meaningful relationship crucible appears; the woman's voice is heard but not contested, flattening what could be dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma history are conveyed through vivid embodiment ("angles mapping ribs, tendons, and the tilt of my jaw"), but the core motivation—seeking "the mathematics of mercy"—remains abstract rather than concretely tied to micro-choices. The forest encounter feels processional rather than agonistic; no contradictory impulses act in scene to test commitment. The final choice (leaving the rule etched on bark, turning toward those still turning screws) arrives without visible trade-off or foreclosed path, reading more as symbolic gesture than earned renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The translator's professional stance and occupational idiom ("I translate what skylines say to shadows") are coherent and voice-specific. Interior motivation is present—honoring overlooked histories—but remains more articulated than contradictory; no on-page impulse tests commitment during the peak lens/painting beat. The child's recovered name functions as a micro-choice that forecloses a path, though the renunciation lacks visible struggle or cost in the moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; much interiority is poetic assertion rather than contradictory sensation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's observational bias and elevator-repair lens shape perception consistently ("gravity prints its diary everywhere"). Interior voice remains distinct through lyric compression, and the choice to wind the mainspring backward reflects genuine agency with visible cost—releasing the ghosts forecloses the investigation. Minor slip: "skillfully observant" is stated rather than demonstrated in a pressured micro-choice, and the final gesture ("pressed my palm") feels slightly enacted rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The operator's interiority is consistently embodied through concrete choices at the press: unscrewing the seed, aligning forms, pulling the lever. The mother's memory shapes present action with felt weight ("Her whisper never returned, and the cloud sea folded over like a book"). The final choice to "bind eternity to a single exhale" forecloses perfection with visible cost—the library "flinched back into motion" and "Perfection had been tasted, and rejected." Minor issue: the protagonist's expertise in this surreal craft never quite stumbles or misreads; competence runs high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and embodied—"poetically inclined even when starving"—with interior contradiction between revolutionary failure and scholarly persistence. Motivation intensifies coherently from personal salvage work through public performance to council vindication. The final moment ("sorrow shone, burnished") embodies cost without therapy-speak. Minor slip: Ledger remains functional opposition without internal contradiction of his own, capping the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interior is grounded in embodied constraint ("I wilt near dishonesty, my bones softening like wax") that drives multiple on-page choices—asking the watchman for truth, confessing the sold lullaby. The confession at the chamber's heart earns the pact with visible cost (shadow forfeiture). Minor slips: some interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than micro-choice texture, and the grandmother's teaching functions more as backstory color than active pressure on present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"sensibly eccentric, preferring lists and boots and small miracles I can pocket"—and the voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature. The compass psychometry beats embody contradictory grief and revelation without therapy-speak. The ending choice (sending boots and compass out on the water, then taking the scarf) shows internal contradiction acted in scene with visible cost: keeping the lesson but releasing the father's navigation tool. The widow connection and father's laugh create earned emotional weight that forecloses paths without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sculptor's traits are established early—"reads knots the way others read lines on palms"—and agency appears in the decision to beach the skiff and construct the gate. However, interior contradiction is minimal; the protagonist proceeds with unwavering competence and no genuine struggle between wants. The grandmother and future-girl silhouettes guide choices without cost, functioning as helpful spirits rather than crucible pressures. The final "vow" feels asserted rather than earned by on-page foreclosure of a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's contemplative stance is sustained through sensory anchors (pressing palm to glass, grinding pigments) and the grandmother's postcards provide embodied history. Interior life remains consistently lyric-reflective rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final panel delivery and verger's revelation feel received rather than chosen, limiting agency. Motivation is signaled but the arc reads more as accumulation than transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (arranging debris, feeding punches into diary), but interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("breath a metronome, my motive simple and ruinous") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother and clerk materialize as purposeful pressure points, yet their agency feels more symbolic than dramatized—they deliver rather than resist. The final choice to file and carry forward reads as stance crystallization with visible cost (remaining "half-retrocognitively trapped"), meeting the length's demand, but the peak beats favor lyric declaration over embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iria's motivation is clear and consistent—she refuses false comfort and commits to methodical rebuilding—but interiority remains somewhat abstract and declarative rather than embodied. The sailor's arrival and bow feel efficient but his interior life is thin; he exists primarily to witness and assist. Micro-choices are present (lighting lanterns, grinding kelp, placing the bottle) but emotional contradiction is muted; Iria's resolve never wavers under genuine internal pressure. The final palm-against-bottle moment attempts embodiment but the "proof enough" phrasing tilts toward summary rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scribe's motivation is consistent—archiving emotional patterns, protecting future breaths—and interiority is densely layered (the harbor memory, the pin metaphor). The climactic choice to leave the prophecy unrecorded feels earned by the childhood parallel and shows visible cost (unarchived work, professional restraint). However, the scribe's specialized role and dead-language method remain largely ornamental; we never see genuine struggle with the ritual's difficulty or a mistake that compounds pressure, only a seamless decision to stop.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is established early and consistently pursued through micro-choices (naming Return, placing the acorn cap, singing the layouts). Interior access is lyric and specific—"hands are furiously tranquil," "taste the clean edge of purpose"—but several beats rely on abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction ("wild serenity" as label). The grandmother's presence at the end reads as symbolic validation rather than earned friction. The renunciation implicit in "kept it without keeping it" carries felt weight, though the passage through seasons compresses agency into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through tactile observations ("warm from the day, cold at the core") and occupational habits that constrain choices. Micro-choices under pressure—opening shutters to listen, delaying the switch, pulling the bell rope—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The character remains credibly flawed (budget audits favor decisiveness) without safety-hedging, and the final stance crystallization feels earned. Minor: the relationship with Reni could apply more immediate pressure rather than serving primarily as a sounding board.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cosmic janitor exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—spiritually curious, seeking vulnerability as strength—that drives micro-choices throughout (asking questions to absence, kneeling to align with panels, speaking names aloud). Interiority is concrete and embodied ("the floor smelled like copper and old tea, and the galaxy smelled like distance, and I balanced both in my lungs"). The final act of opening the roof and standing with the lantern represents a meaningful shift earned by prior causality, though the protagonist's agency leans toward observation and empathy rather than decisive action that narrows options with high cost. Emotional progression is credible but occasionally edges toward slightly elevated self-awareness ("I realized the purpose of my small life was not to erase marks, but to polish them into guidance").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recluse's interiority is embodied through concrete rituals (the glass box, daily placement of shards) and his perceptual signature is consistent—reading ghosts "through contextual clues" and answering with "pauses and careful placement." The shift from broker to witness is earned through specific memory (pesticide clauses, the signature he wore) that charges his final stance. Internal contradiction appears when he recognizes the queen as "the burning that spared him once" and opens the box despite knowing heat's cost, creating genuine tension. Minor deduction: the ghosts' collective presence could have applied more individuated pressure on his choices rather than serving primarily as mute audience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior texture is consistent and embodied through sensory detail ("hear the mildew where last year waited"), and the childhood cricket memory earns the final stance shift. However, the motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" remains largely abstract—announced rather than tested through competing desires or visible cost. Lio arrives as a helper rather than applying pressure, flattening what could have been a relationship crucible. The borrowed heart functions as atmospheric metaphor but never constrains a choice or forces a tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's "warmly attentive" stance drives his approach to the boy, and the shift from solitary observation to active tending is earned. However, the interiority remains abstract—phrases like "to discover beauty in the incomplete" and "woven dawns are hues braided from mistakes" read as thematic declarations rather than embodied thought under pressure. The boy's grief is more successfully rendered through the image of "wind inside him" and his stunned tracking of the kite, grounding loss in physical sensation. Micro-choices (offering the feather, kneeling to write) advance the interaction, but the poet's internal contradictions or personal cost never surface.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker's interiority is grounded in concrete tasks (copper wire, grafting) and contradictory impulses—brazen calm alongside mortality—are present but mostly told rather than dramatized in real-time struggle. The late communal turn ("A council formed") introduces new actors without clear status dynamics or individual resistance, flattening the protagonist's singular arc. Micro-choices like placing the diary and winding the final copper circle embody renunciation with visible cost, meeting the baseline for Earned Stasis. The reflective passages anchor to present stimuli (pillars humming, gulls dropping shells) and tilt present stance, satisfying BRR expanded mode, but the protagonist's agency in the final third becomes more curatorial than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's "luminous skeptic" stance is embodied through vocabulary ("valence and patience," "rate constant") and the eyebrow-raise moment, but internal contradiction is thin—skepticism never genuinely complicates a choice. The father memory and amber handling show embodied connection, yet the protagonist observes more than decides; the final understanding arrives via passive reception rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The facilitator and strangers remain functional presences without applying interpersonal pressure that would test the narrator's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and embodied through repeated concrete actions—cracking pods, pulling bayonets, kneeling to plant—that show patient reclamation work. Interiority remains thin; we see what he does and infer purpose, but contradictory impulses or internal friction never surface. The final choice to leave and return tomorrow feels inevitable rather than costly, more ritual than renunciation. Embodied emotion is present in gesture ("thumb and palm finding the seam") but the piece leans descriptive over psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's intuitively descriptive trait is embodied through concrete choices—catalog by smell, farewell by color—and drives the leaf-as-compass attempt. Harbor's character is richly particularized (ears like folded flags, nose knows grief) with embodied presence across beats. Motivation to translate distance into closeness operates clearly through micro-choices: trading copper teeth, lighting the wax, walking to the relay. Minor weakness: the radio tech's backstory arrives late and resolves a problem mostly through off-stage preparation rather than on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"blessed pariah the board tolerated," "confusion into exploration"—and embodied through the sketching ritual. Internal contradiction operates in the simultaneous pride and isolation of being right. The manual-safety decision and its aftermath ground motivation in visible cost (blackout, board scrutiny, social exile). Minor deduction: the grandmother's teaching and family custom feel more expository than lived contradiction shaping a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's "chivalrous thief" identity and apprentice status are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("fear teaches but wonder persuades") that reads as writerly insight rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final choice to swap chess pieces feels motivated by the quest structure more than by embodied internal conflict. Embodiment is present in "my hands trembled" and "my gloves shook," but the vast reflective middle distances emotion from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is distinctly embodied—"the real blast braided my lungs with phrases no director could erase"—and the shift from crisis actor to archivist is motivated by a need to "unbind the record from spectacle." Micro-choices under pressure (cutting away apologies while holding elbows, setting the chessboard, spelling words with footsteps) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the cast of strangers remains largely undifferentiated beyond professional labels (nurse, janitor, widow), and their agency is limited to participating in the narrator's orchestrated ritual rather than exerting independent pressure. The change at closure—becoming a traveler with the nomadic penumbra—feels more announced than earned through visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior is specific and embodied—the feather's barbs enumerating syllables, the stone's warmth as recognition—and the motivation to recover buried language drives on-page choices. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("your rooms are the feelings you refuse to name") that reads more like theme statement than lived contradiction. The seer remains functionally static, serving as guide without her own stakes or visible cost. The final choice to "seed my tongue with my old consonants" feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle with a specific, lived tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chess tutor's interiority is embodied through concrete choices (touching threads, counting knight's pace) and contradictory impulses—desire to forgive versus tasting "ashes from the kingdom I had burned." The protagonist's professional lens (pattern-reading, pedagogical patience) filters every perception and choice consistently. Minor slip: the memory of the prince pouring wine feels slightly generic compared to the surrounding specificity, but the final choice between releasing "entirely, at once" versus "careful increments, lesson by lesson" is earned and forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The artist's motivation is clear and intensifies through the sequence, though interiority remains somewhat lyric-abstract rather than embodied. The micro-choice to pay twice for the child carries visible cost ("the weight inside him at last unclench"), earning the final forfeiture. Internal contradiction is present but muted—theft guilt versus defiant revision—and the embodied struggle stays gestural. The child functions well as secondary pressure with his dividing chant that shifts the price structure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The uncertain alchemist's interiority is richly embodied through concrete gestures—calipers kissing craters, face-dunking as ritual—and the internal contradiction between doubt and compulsion lands cleanly. The bond with Mira is dramatized through objects and sensory memory rather than abstraction, and the final choice to hang the charm back carries visible cost: "swings toward the statue, as if that moon had found a tide again." Minor slip: the phrase "quilts memories together, piecing blueprints to lullabies" risks abstraction, but the surrounding tactile work anchors it. Motivation intensifies from "promised myself" to visible stakes (the engine, the charm) under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter's internal contradiction—intimately aloof with places, not people—is embodied through micro-choices (entering the cave, kneeling at the pool, drawing the harbor line, backing away). The promise to paint "the inside of the sea" drives a credible arc from avoidance to fulfillment to renunciation, with visible cost: the choice to leave rather than "live in the painting." Interiority remains specific and poetic without therapy-speak, though the final stance ("keeping the promise means not living in the painting") skirts the edge of over-articulation. The shell functions as both memory anchor and tool, grounding motivation in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and voice-specific ("the ear he keeps behind his ribs"), with embodied moments like pressing the cork to the lips. However, the mentor's sudden shift from sleep to witness ("only closes his eyes") feels unmotivated—no prior beat earns his receptivity. The protagonist's philosophy-driven choices (whisper over shout) remain consistent but lack genuine internal contradiction or doubt that would force a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and distinctive—"the questions rust in my mouth," "her voice rise through my ribs the way surf rises through stones"—and the journey back to the shelter embodies grief through micro-choices (wrapping the censer foot, kneeling to find notes). Internal contradiction operates subtly: the navigator accepts instructions without knowing why, yet the final act recognizes that the compass "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." The Mara backstory is substantial but anchored in present sensory cues (the beacon pointing inland, the station's pulse) and tilts the present stance toward accepting loss as route rather than recovery, meeting BRR reflection-led allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's trait of involuntary truthfulness generates effective internal contradiction ("I could not lie to them, so I focused on what my honesty did not have to illuminate"), and the embodied moment with the patrol—smearing clay on the eye, answering truthfully while occluding detail—demonstrates micro-choices under pressure. The girl's confession about her father's departure earns pathos through concrete detail ("felt his terror like a hive under skin"). Minor weaknesses: secondary characters (the girl, the patrol) remain functional but underdeveloped, and the final move toward "fractured grace" edges close to diagnostic summary rather than fully embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper's interiority is concrete and particular—"I investigate by the only method that has ever yielded light without scaring it away, by observing gaps"—and his choice to answer the stranger's final gesture with light carries visible cost (committing to a witness role he cannot abandon). The "softly persistent" trait shapes his investigative method throughout. Minor slip: the borrowed memory of the girl arrives fully formed without the micro-hesitation or friction one might expect when reconstructing fifteen-year-old events, slightly diluting the embodied struggle at that pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The map dealer's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("cataloging other people choosing in vellum and ink"), with embodied hesitation across years before the midsummer decision. Micro-choices under pressure—crouching to watch ants, pressing the chip, taking it back—reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (removing the chip "because leaving it would make the door too easy") forecloses a path with visible cost, meeting the Earned Stasis test. Minor slip: Ruth's empirically intuitive wisdom is told more than dramatized in contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's motivation is clear—unraveling recurring dreams—and embodied through concrete choices: leaving the crown, climbing, touching the stone self. Internal contradiction appears in her refusal to dismiss dreams versus serving the throne as "a ghost of unasked questions," but the wanderer's meta-commentary ("once I kept watch at your cradle") and the moth/flame analogy flatten what should be earned realization into told wisdom. The final choice lacks visible cost on the page; she "unstitch[es]" from her stone self and wears dreams "like a ring," but we don't see what she forfeits or how this alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "pocket-sun alchemist" functions more as a role-label than a dramatized character with contradictory impulses. Interiority remains abstract and decorative ("my loves are scientifically romantic") rather than embodied under pressure. The final promise ("We will spend it carefully") reads as assertion rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Micro-choices during the experiment are present but feel more like procedure than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lucid dream chronicler's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied through specific micro-choices ("I choose to soar...not away but along"). Internal contradiction operates well—jealousy of past selves versus acceptance of chronological confusion. The protagonist's renunciation at the ending (patrolling "the day after my own funeral" rather than correcting the burial) forecloses the path of resurrection with visible cost. Minor penalty for occasional label-leaning phrases ("feral nostalgia paced the room") that border on abstraction, though most emotional beats remain embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—embodied loss of smell, mapping emotional terrain through sensory substitutes. The visiting father's anxiety is portrayed through gesture and hesitation rather than labels, with his fear tied to past trauma (the baby who stopped breathing). The repair becomes a shared act of humanizing rather than commanding, but the emotional arc leans slightly toward received wisdom rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. The final choice to release him feels earned but arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied—"my chest is starting to burn," the micro-choices around breath and ink application reveal character under pressure. Internal conflict is present in the tension between fear and the impulse to transform scars, though the final choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won. The reflective backstory (kiln burn, river cut, sister conflict) anchors present action and tilts the stance, staying within BRR allowances. Motivation is clear but the embodied struggle at closure could be sharper; the drink feels ceremonial rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("gossip-column exorcist" who "mistook spinning for direction"), with embodied contradictions ("every call was a chord I could not finger without bleeding"). The choice to expose the foreman demonstrates agency under pressure, and Mara's ghost applies meaningful opposition through the stylus exchanges. Minor slip: the final reconciliation feels slightly hasty given the weight of the betrayal, though the cost (career exposure) is present.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's identity as "end of history witness" is established early with embodied detail (dictionary against heart, pencil nub), and the walking meditation creates micro-choices that reveal values. Internal contradiction appears in the realization "my title was wrong and right," and the choice to loosen the straps and speak the illusions aloud carries visible cost in relinquishing certainty. However, the interiority leans heavily toward abstract philosophical reflection ("unify the broken record," "braided the breath") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the embodied struggle remains mostly cerebral rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—the mantle clock key becomes a tactile anchor for inheritance and professional heresy. Motivation coheres: the desire to understand clocks beyond forced measurement drives micro-choices (adjusting valves, counting drops backward). The final stance is earned through accumulative perception rather than epiphany, with visible cost in the bleeding finger and the foreman note. Minor slip: the grandmother's presence in reflection feels slightly too tidy, though it remains embodied through the key.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's internal contradiction—trained caution versus "the thrill of unknowns that become knowns"—is embodied in the weighing of risk and stewardship; the final decision to "widen perspectives responsibly" arises from that friction. Interiority is concrete ("odds stacked against grammar," "variance at the track") and voice-specific. Minor deduction: the father's character is largely reflective rather than pressuring choices on the page, though he functions effectively as motivational ground. No flat therapy-speak; emotional complexity lands with embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is strongly embodied through her sensory relationship with the wires and disc, and her motivation to maintain "cultivated estrangement" creates genuine internal tension. The micro-choices—routing the child's line through Rojo and Flora, keeping herself outside the doorframes—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the "melodically haunted" descriptor leans label-only in early passages, though it gains some weight through the glass disc work. The final renunciation (letting endings go upstairs while she stays standing) carries visible cost and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's methodology ("gently thorough") is stated but the narrator's interiority remains at a distance—more oracle than person under pressure. The woman's emotion is embodied (breath tremors, locket clicks), yet her arc from grief to tentative reunion lacks visible internal contradiction or struggle; the footsteps arrive as convenience rather than as a choice she precipitates. The final shared departure carries symbolic weight but no on-page micro-choice by either party that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The logistician's "desperately jocular" trait appears as label and description but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Interior access remains thin—we observe actions (moving, pairing, redirecting) but never enter contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final gesture (slipping the moon rock, mislaying their name) reads as symbolic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price. The piece privileges atmospheric observation over embodied interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The blind mapmaker's interiority is vivid and specific—absorbing languages through skin, dowsing for emotional currents—but motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. The arc from selling "certainties in blue ink" to learning grief's "native coast" is told in reflection without on-page micro-choices that reveal competing wants. The final acceptance ("not escape but axis") arrives through exposition rather than a dramatized renunciation with visible cost. Embodied details (ring cooling, fern writing on wrist) are strong, but the protagonist observes more than she decides under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinctive—"confidently uncertain, wary of declarations but fluent in attention"—and embodied emotion appears in concrete moments: chest tight with "the old shame that tastes like rusted tools," the ritual of pressing nib to wrist. The motivation to trade guilt for knowledge drives micro-choices (taking Del's pen, writing furrows on scrap), and the final stance—"still uncertain, and still confident enough to bear it"—earns closure through prior causality. Minor slip: the reflective passages occasionally drift toward label-speak ("strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters") without full dramatization of cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arin's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "joyful sorrow" and repeated gestures read more as atmospheric texture than specific psychological tension driving choices. The advisor remains a cipher—breath and whisper without distinct resistance or complication. Micro-choices exist (holding the clapper, signing to water) but feel ornamental rather than foreclosing paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a backstory promise, but interiority trends toward lyric abstraction ("analytically intuitive meeting analytically intuitive") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The self-portrait's throat-gouge and the seed-planting moment show micro-choices, yet the final stance feels declared rather than earned through visible internal conflict. Miren remains a constructed absence; their relationship is told through metaphor ("kiln, not a bomb") without on-page friction that would test loyalty or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and embodied ("ribs hollowed like flutes"), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—rebellion paired with care for Mira and the unnamed donors. The choice to "carry what did not belong, if it returned Mira breathing" and the ritual drumming show agency under pressure with visible cost. The interiority remains concrete and character-particular, though the metaphoric density occasionally edges toward diagnostic self-awareness ("entangled memories were not a side effect for me; they were the entire shape of love") that reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis thought.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ivo's interior is specific and embodied—tracing animals on the zodiac coin to remember cycles, tasting metallic weather, listening to boot conversations—with a perceptual signature grounded in his labyrinth maintenance expertise. His motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts drives the rescue method without over-articulation. The courier and Rade remain functional but thin; Rade's acceptance of the challenge feels slightly convenient, though his final acknowledgment carries cost (surrendering authority). Minor slip: Ivo's competence borders on flawless; genuine struggle is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is embodied through precise perceptual choices ("palm damp and expectant," "shame tried retreating") and the brother's suicide backstory anchors present stakes without expository drift. The guardian remains properly opaque—his silence and gestures constrain rather than explain—though his motivations stay purely external. The narrator's micro-choices (accepting the mirror, angling light toward drowned arches) carry visible cost tied to grief work, and the final shift ("my voice returned like floodwater") earns its claim through prior causality. Minor: "spiralingly calm" recurs as label without dramatized contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chess coach's motivation is grounded in a desire to slow the town's pace, and the children's "unspoken words" create a consistent perceptual filter. However, interiority often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("strategy is just long listening") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic grotto scene shows the coach watching rather than wrestling with a live choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Micro-choices exist (organizing displays, placing boards) but lack the weight of genuine internal conflict or felt renunciation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular ("grace is what I hide in my muscles"), and the final choice to name themselves and cross carries embodied cost. However, motivation feels more asserted than dramatized—the decision to speak aloud crystallizes suddenly without sufficient internal friction leading up to it. The move from "I had never named myself aloud" to immediate proclamation lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the choice into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's blank-faced performer persona is strongly embodied through micro-choices (teaching children "angles of light that read as joy without needing the organ underneath"). Internal contradiction operates consistently: paid compliance versus teaching the unmeasurable pause. The whittling and staging lessons reveal a hierarchy of values under surveillance pressure. Motivation remains character-particular throughout, though the final turn ("not joy, but lightness") feels slightly abstract rather than a bodily choice with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interiority remains largely opaque—we see them touch columns and speak but never access contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The collective "we" POV dilutes individual agency; no single character makes a high-stakes choice with visible internal cost. The former guard's tear-comma moment gestures toward transformation but is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared ("to stride through boundaries") but never tested by competing desires or genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ivo's colorblindness is established early and shapes his perceptual signature ("eyes sort light like gravel, shapes clear but hues guessed"), but his agency is largely observational rather than decisional until the reed moment. The choice to offer his brush and jar of smoke to acquire the reed shows concrete motivation, and the final decision to stay ("tells Mira with basil at the furnace door that he wants to stay") demonstrates earned commitment. However, the stakes feel more thematic than visceral; Ivo's journey from seeking beauty in imperfection to finding it through rhythm doesn't involve enough contradictory impulses or genuine struggle to elevate characterization into high bands. Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly textured with embodied detail ("my hands are powerfully gentle, calibrated to wake sleeping metal") and the volunteer's moment with the ferry bell offers genuine emotional complexity. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract self-diagnosis ("I am here to discover the texture of connection") and decorative introspection that doesn't always translate into micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—"I will follow, powerfully gentle, because I want to learn the braid we become"—feels more like theme declaration than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's grief and creative paralysis ("the metal would not take a polish") anchor strong interiority with visible cost. Micro-choices—opening drawers, soldering clasps where visitors hesitate—ground the shift from personal mourning to teaching grief rituals. The final stance crystallizes without therapy-speak: "to illuminate what refuses itself, and to wait." A small slip: the mother's question ("what the curtains meant") invites slight over-articulation, though the answer remains imagistic enough to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer's interiority is filtered through the apprentice's observation, creating distance that dilutes emotional specificity. The steadily curious trait receives label-only treatment without constraining choices or creating visible costs. Micro-choices exist (accepting currencies, choosing routes) but lack internal contradiction or embodied emotional struggle. The final beat with the bandmate woman shows purposeful methodology but no character change or renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator demonstrates embodied emotion and consistent POV bias (breath, pulse, fingertips) throughout. The child of bronze and wind functions as a secondary character, but the relationship doesn't pressure choice; their partnership is collaborative without friction. The protagonist's change from archivist to teacher feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses dramatized on the page. Internal conflict exists as abstract hunger versus "arrogance of conquest," but the resolution never forecloses a path with visible cost—the narrator simply breathes and descends.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's characterization shows clear motivation ("preserve the shape of hope") and embodied choices—trading her stored dreams, whispering to vines—but interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("felt something in herself lean toward the sorrow") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (pouring dreams into soil) is dramatized but Ilen remains functionally passive, a recipient rather than a pressure source. No diagnostic label-speak, but the lyric density occasionally replaces embodied struggle with figurative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The handler's interiority is textured and embodied—"I warmed the forceps, spoke to the chameleon, and drew a shallow breath" shows micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction surfaces in "I wanted credulity" vs. the decision to strip vanity: desire for trust wrestles with self-reproach. The final move—placing tail tip beside brochure—is earned by prior reflection on "beliefs can blacken," foreclosing naive hope with visible cost. Minor deduction: the broker con is told rather than dramatized, reducing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular: "I am a blade disguised as a salve" embodies contradiction through metaphor rather than label. The choice to plant the ivy cutting in the fossil coffee ring is earned by prior causality (the displaced miracle, the telepathic bond, the surgeon's numbing ritual) and forecloses the wound-opening path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "accidentally telepathic with plants" trait edges toward diagnostic self-awareness in early exposition, though it is later grounded in embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crystal gazer's interiority is richly textured through spatial metaphor and embodied perception, particularly the warehouse visualization. Internal contradiction appears when she realizes "her own, the life she had shelved," creating a moment of self-recognition with cost. However, the final action—writing "stay, because what I mean is do not leave"—feels abruptly unmotivated; the prior causality builds toward understanding unused love but doesn't prepare the reader for this specific renunciation or its target. The embodied details (palm against metal gate, paper edge grazing skin) ground the psychometry effectively, but the peak choice lacks clear stakes that would make the cost of staying versus leaving legible.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to free trapped creativity is clear and sustained, but interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("dark awe," "shadowed rapture") rather than embodied contradiction. The sculptor's recovery is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional states are asserted through elevated language ("weeps as if a knot inside her unwinds") without the gritty particulars that would ground them in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The freight guard's choices drive the arc: humming the charm, engaging the archive, deploying the lantern spores. Embodiment is strong ("cold breaths of not yet, brushing my knuckles"), and the final renunciation of dreams for duty ("I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere") forecloses rest with visible cost. Interiority remains vivid and idiosyncratic throughout. Minor: the archive's motivations remain opaque, limiting the relationship crucible, but the single-POV focus holds.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is concretely anchored in sensory experience ("leaves ticking like clocks," "gear knocks against my cup") and the philosopher's micro-choices—walking toward the grove, pressing the gear home—are motivated by the ache in the hum. Internal contradiction appears when the protagonist resists repair ("I did not want to repair it, because ruin teaches what perfection hides") yet acts anyway, driven by necessity. The change at closure is earned: the protagonist gains calibration of the sixth sense and accepts the translocations as teaching rather than affliction. Minor weakness: some interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("I am not a mystic, only practical with mysteries") rather than embodied stakes, though it remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is carefully rendered through embodied perception—"the ache points outward," the star "warms"—and the journey shows consistent motivation toward claiming courage. However, the guides remain largely interchangeable and deliver wisdom without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The final reach for courage is earned by prior refusal, but the moment risks abstraction ("warmer than fear," "heavy as love") rather than a concrete choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is textured and character-specific, with nerve regeneration embodied through "shocks" as letters and pain as a metronome. The final choice—remaining to "renegotiate" safety's price through listening—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the easier path of departure. Internal contradictions appear (injury "choral," safety both needed and suffocating), and micro-choices (pocketing the bolt, sitting at the bench) reveal values under pressure. Backstory is minimal and anchored to present stimuli; no therapy-speak intrudes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyr's motivation to unmask Serane is clear and his patient orchestration demonstrates consistent character logic. The diminutive titan's choices drive key turns—arranging the books, deploying the ink pellet—but his interiority remains abstract ("regally unpretentious," "smallest of titans") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. Serane's arc from confidence to confession shows progression, yet her emotional shifts feel telescoped; the line "tears brilliant as a forfeit" labels rather than dramatizes the cost. The final moment where Lyr "swept the fallen pride into a pan" literalizes metaphor in a way that flattens embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through the practice of tapping, which reveals a diver's observational discipline. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between scientific record-keeping and the need to translate data into human-scale guidance for the villagers. The choice to radio the village and choreograph the crossing is earned by weeks of puzzle-solving, though the emotional stakes remain more conceptual than visceral. Minor deduction for the dreamed-spine image feeling slightly external to the established interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular: "awkwardly confident," seeking echoes because "echoes told the truth," speaking to the stones about her father. Her choices under pressure—pressing palms to the stones, risking waking silencers, sending the map to the rooftops—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal contradiction surfaces when she realizes "she had carried it only to justify her feet," and her final stance crystallizes as "orientation rather than rage." Minimal embodied emotion under stress; the circuit scene reads slightly abstract, but the arc from searching to broadcasting is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lida's motivation—to evolve tradition with intent rather than accept implanted destiny—is clear and generates contradictory pressures: loyalty to elders versus self-determination. Her interior voice is consistent and embodied through plant-mediated perception, though the final choice feels slightly underdramatized; the vine "borrowed breath" and she "showed" it images rather than wrestling with a visceral trade-off. The council's refusal and her solitary act create genuine stakes, but the ease with which the embryo accepts her vision ("listening, learning us") softens the cost. Internal conflict is present but could be sharper at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rafi's interiority is embodied and specific—the photograph fold showing bodies at edges, vent fans triggering freeze response, somatic markers enacted on the page. Internal contradictions surface through wanting "to anchor optimism in realism" while carrying trauma that still locks his body. The gull scene dramatizes his freeze response and recovery through Leda's voice without therapy-speak intruding at the peak moment. Minor: the niece conversation risks over-articulation ("rooms that storms could enter without wrecking") but the photograph handling earns the reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal state is richly embodied through specific sensory details and concrete actions—gathering cards, mapping shelves, braiding threads—that escalate pressure without exposition. Her descent is motivated by a coherent desire ("to descend into necessary darkness") enacted through micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The interior voice remains consistent and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak even under stress. Minor slip: the transformation from "crestfallen" to closure feels earned by action but lacks a sharply contradictory impulse acting *in scene* to push into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The albino tracker possesses a distinct perceptual signature—reading vanishing ink patterns, teaching the hummingbird to "taste ink"—and the motivation is rooted in past trauma (mentor's death). However, the final choice to refuse the throne and "let the ink on my skin disappear" feels abstract rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. The interiority leans toward elevated philosophical register ("consciously wild stillness," "serene anger") that occasionally distances us from embodied emotion under pressure, and the protagonist's expertise is so complete that genuine struggle is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's interiority is densely textured and consistent—"faithful to preservation and starving for escape" drives the central choice. The hesitation ritual ("arranging lamps, recording breath, polishing the seal again") embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final decision to release the letter feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost: "I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free, only that both mattered." Minor deduction: the archivist's expertise in conduit mechanics arrives late without prior signal, slightly weakening the preparation for the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is concrete and character-particular, with embodied details like threading stories through irrigation tubes and holding the sandbag scrap. Internal contradiction surfaces in "senselessly perceptive"—feeling more than she can prove, less than she would strike—and drives her micro-choices with visitors. The emotional progression from restraint to teaching gratitude reads earned, though the father's absence remains more told than dramatically tested on the page. Minor slip: the trio's arc from scoffing to planting names feels compressed without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fisher's cool-headed stance is asserted but not contradicted by embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction—"calm is a net you mend every hour"—rather than concrete sensation or impulse. The goddess's dialogue feels slightly too articulate for an echo from rubble, lacking the vocal roughness or fragmentation one might expect. The final act of lifting and releasing the spike reads as a decision, but the stakes of hoarding versus opening remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The heiress's motivation is concrete and her choices drive pressure, particularly the proof-by-contradiction wager and the board call. Interior reflection is filtered through "devotedly observant" and the rosewood nib's sensory cue, though the father flashback occupies space without altering present tactics. The caretaker's arc from weary defense to "gently astonished" wonder is earned, and his confession about wanting to "smooth the sea" reads as genuine character work rather than convenience. Micro-choices under pressure (touching the lever, resting the pen nib) reveal hierarchy without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's guilt and the journey toward answering it through tattooing is embodied through concrete choices: reading letters aloud, holding amber to the recorder, tattooing the woman's wrist, and finally inking himself. The backstory of leaving "a girl whose laugh had not yet begun" provides causal motivation, though the relationship between that past refusal and the present client's baby remains more symbolic than directly motivated. Interiority is vivid and specific ("my throat remembered the cold") but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dissonance of old guilt," "waveforms") that feels more thematic than character-bound. The final self-tattooing earns closure through prior setup, but the emotional arc from guilt to tentative reconciliation could be more contradictory under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's socially perceptive trait is asserted repeatedly but rarely dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The bearded man's vulnerability is prompted by the narrator's gesture, but the narrator's internal contradiction or cost in that moment remains abstract. The tile flake warms as emotional validation rather than creating a dilemma that tests the narrator's values. Interiority leans toward poetic observation rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through steel arms and the tessera-handling, with the "warm coldness" paradox creating consistent interiority. However, the POV remains abstract throughout—"I" is a concept more than a character with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The renaming ritual provides micro-choices, but the narrator's stance never wavers or costs them anything on the page; they operate as a conduit rather than an agent under pressure. The boy and the men receive decisions, but the narrator's own internal conflict between "heat and frost" stays declarative rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's synesthetic perception is consistent and specific ("smell blue like winter plums," "hear gold leaves"), creating a distinct interiority. The motivation to help the ghost achieve closure through ritual is clear, though the emotional stakes remain abstract—why *this* narrator must perform this duty lacks personal cost or contradiction. The ghost's characterization is atmospheric but passive; he bows, reaches, and asks, but makes no decisions that alter tactics. The final choice to "finish letting go together" gestures toward change but the cost to the narrator—what path is foreclosed—remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator and Mara exhibit interiority and embodied emotion through sensory processing and somatic signaling, but the emotional arc stays largely within a single register of gentle melancholy. Mara's journey from skepticism to softened acceptance shows genuine progression, yet the brotherly morphine fragment and the father's map feel more like narrative furniture than fully embodied stakes—the on-page micro-choices don't compellingly test conflicting impulses. The final embrace is earned by the accumulation of ritual, but the lack of one raw, contradictory moment under pressure keeps this from high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The map maker's interiority is concrete and filtered through their sensory practice ("I count them like syllables," "I understand that the leaf is not decoration but contract"). Micro-choices under pressure are visible: pressing the fossil, waiting without moving, clipping it during the surge, relocating it deeper. The final promise carries weight and forecloses a path of ownership. Internal contradiction between the desire to speak and the discipline of restraint operates throughout, embodied in gesture and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is present and voice-consistent, driven by a desire to reshape prophecy through cataloging buttons. However, motivation remains largely declarative rather than tested under pressure—the theft is stated as a vow, the method arrives "the way a moth comes," but no on-page contradiction or cost materializes until the very end when villagers arrive. The final gesture of passing the jar and opening the warehouse feels more like thematic tableau than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ansel's motivation is embodied through concrete micro-choices: kneeling to trace messages, weighing the pillbox, walking to the edge to release the microfilm. His scarred body and the pillbox's weight anchor interiority in physical particulars. The final choice—slipping the ring onto his finger—closes a visible arc from exile to renewed belonging with felt cost (retirement of secrets, acceptance of steadier work). Minor slip: "unused courage waits" appears as both telling and showing, weakening full embodiment at the thematic hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's interior life reads distinctly—spindrift serenity and closely attentive awareness anchor his stance—and his goal to "distill complexity into essence" receives concrete motion through the needle-and-stitching ritual. Wren's embodiment ("eyes holding their own lantern") and the ferryman's softening shoulders supply embodied emotion. However, key choices lack visible cost: the decision to cross feels pre-determined, and Wren's map-stitching does not foreclose an alternative path on the page. The final image offers calm resolution without a dramatized trade-off, leaving motivation clean but agency muted.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The potter's internal landscape is embodied through kiln and clay metaphors that root choices in craft knowledge ("I will hold you without forcing you"). The character's stance evolves through micro-choices—filling the dish, cleaning frames, singing—each reflecting a value hierarchy without therapy-speak. Her decision to leave cups in multiple timelines forecloses return, a renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: some reflective passages drift toward abstraction ("phototropic to kindness") rather than staying grounded in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied through gardening metaphors and the father's lockpicking inheritance, creating a distinct perceptual lens. Internal contradictions appear in the tension between pragmatic caution and the risky climb, and micro-choices (kneeling at the lock, sheltering the flame) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—instilling light in corners and alleys—feels earned by the accumulation of care and loss, though the mother's condition and the protagonist's delay remain slightly abstract. No label-speak mars the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior life is concrete and deeply textured—polishing the sundial until "atomically reflective," cataloging "weather" as memory. The motivation to "translate isolation into independence, without hardening into salt" is embodied through micro-choices (angling the dial, singing the herd song, preparing empty chairs). However, the piece leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than dramatized contradiction; the narrator's struggle feels more meditated than enacted under pressure, and the final stance is more lyric crystallization than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior world is richly textured through their role as ghostwriter and art-maker, with embodied details like "carrying them, a keeper of secrets walking in prismatic quiet." The two lovers remain largely externalized—their emotions told through watching "how they walked, each bearing stormlight as if it were a shy animal" rather than dramatized contradiction. The narrator's choice to place the letters is present but the cost feels gestural; we see the design work but not a moment where competing impulses collide on the page. Interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than live friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and embodied—"I breathed in dust and stubbornness," "I laughed once, sounding afraid"—with clear motivations driving the arc from passive listening to active interference. Internal contradiction emerges organically: cautious hope versus skepticism, temptation to accept tenure versus commitment to autonomy. The choice to "interfere" and the final refusal of the committee chair are earned by prior causality and foreclose paths with visible cost. Minor slips: secondary characters (dean, callers, janitor) apply pressure but remain lightly sketched; the wave's temptations ("painless nights," tenure) feel slightly generic against the otherwise concrete sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The claustrophobic explorer's interiority is embodied through breath-counting and chest tightness, and the compass point becomes a concrete anchor for her grandmother's influence. The trait "prudently adventurous" generates visible tactics (chalk, exit strategy) that shape on-page choices. However, the motivational arc—recovering the key to access the Observatory—proceeds without meaningful internal conflict or contradiction; the protagonist never wavers or pays a psychological price that forecloses an alternative path. The final choice to thread the key and walk toward the Observatory feels like fulfillment of an established plan rather than a decision that alters stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's face blindness is established early and shapes their investigative method—reading postures rather than faces, methodical observation. Interior texture is distinct ("I draw the way riverbeds remember water"), though the final revelation from the woman's letter arrives off-page, reducing the protagonist's agency at closure. Embodied perception is strong (threading the ribbon, feeling its memory of a bow), but the core choice to "paint both" harm and help feels more conceptual than viscerally tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's identity as a map librarian is established with concrete traits ("stubborn about honoring the dead," carries the nail "like a compass"), and the ancestor motivation drives the climactic choice to insert the nail. However, interiority often tilts toward lyric assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The director remains a stock antagonist ("eyes are two dry prunes," "dry as paperwork") without nuance, and Liza's late arrival provides emotional callback but minimal friction. Micro-choices exist (asking the panel aloud, sliding the nail) but the protagonist's path feels more scripted than genuinely conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fiddler's motivations are consistent—grief, loyalty, and creative agency drive the journey—but interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The hitchhiker remains sketch-like, defined by negatives and mystery rather than pressure that alters the protagonist's stance beat by beat. The final reunion feels earned by the music-as-ritual premise, yet the cost remains conceptual ("pixelated amnesty") rather than viscerally felt in a micro-choice that forecloses a legible path. Embodied emotion is present but diffuse across lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is distinct and lyric, with embodied perceptions ("my tongue was a ticket stub, torn, passed, forgotten"). However, the piece favors atmospheric observation over contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final turn to understanding the circular path feels more meditated than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The emotional progression remains consistent but lacks the visible cost-laden choices that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I had practiced until my throat knew the cadence"), and the choice to witness Mara is embodied through micro-decisions (opening the telegram, tuning the scope). The shared burden concept emerges through dramatized action rather than summary. Mara's fierce urgency and the narrator's attention-as-healing stance create a credible relationship crucible, though Mara's backstory arrives mostly through exposition rather than contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's voice is consistent and distinctive—"I am a guarded druid, taught to keep my face calm"—with strong embodied detail in the physical work of mapping currents and handling the seed. Internal contradiction appears in "my guarded heart unbends one unmilitant notch," suggesting cost. However, the mayor remains largely a passive prop; his reactions are told rather than shown in choices, and the crowd functions as scenery. The finale's emotional shift feels slightly rushed given the weight of corruption revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is present throughout with embodied detail ("questions in my ribs," "anxious elation... jittering but firm"), and the choice to heed the leaves and offer a new vow demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the protagonist's emotional arc is more texture-driven than causally motivated; the grafted state reads as metaphor more than a constraint that drives micro-choices. The woman's scar-sharing method introduces a relationship crucible, but her arrival feels convenient rather than earned from prior causality. Motivations are vivid but not always contradictory in scene—closer to poetic stance than embodied internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied through grandmother's burned card and micro-choices (giving name to the boy, scattering stories). Interior voice remains consistent and particular ("foolish with hope, yet the foolishness had learned how to hold its breath"). The boy's transformation from soldier's future to scholar's hush is earned through on-page action. Minor slip: the Weaver's palimpsest face borders on decorative metaphor without fully constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotional contradictions ("my practiced distance flutter like a tarp, then still itself"). The protagonist's micro-choices—cataloging the locker, assigning the scrap differential value, writing the interpretive note—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal conflict is present but largely sequential rather than simultaneous: the promise to "not feel anything" versus the hand that "knew exactly which cabinet." The final renunciation (pricing some items low, elevating the scrap) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, meeting the core test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The translator's interior life is vivid and specific—"my hands trust grooves more than ink"—with clear motivation rooted in a desire to understand transition rather than retrieve the spirit. Micro-choices (reading tablets aloud, adjusting nodes, planting the seed) accumulate pressure and embody methodical care. The final stance (keeping company with transition rather than owning it) earns closure through visible restraint. Minor: the physicist-spirit remains abstract; more concrete memory friction would deepen the relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The titan-gear librarian POV sustains a consistent perceptual signature—mechanical, patient, accretive—and the choices (cataloging, accepting contradictions, shelving paradox) align with the established persona. The woman's shifting names create a relationship beat that forces the librarian to act: she takes the cards, pours words from the creel, and rings the bells. However, interiority remains largely declarative ("My work is to preserve wonder in routine") rather than embodied under pressure, and the transformation at closure (the woman's kelp coat drying into paper) is observed, not dramatically chosen by the protagonist. The final micro-choice—rinsing the creel to "teach them currents"—is deliberate but lacks visible conflict or cost that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is dense and voice-particular, but the reflective mode dominates without sufficient micro-choices under pressure. The turn from "measuring doors for panic" to becoming "a conduit" is declared rather than earned through dramatized contradiction. The bunker inspector role feels more like a framing device than a source of on-page tension; no professional constraint or expertise shapes a pivotal choice. Emotional embodiment is present but often arrives via poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"daringly methodical" drives the graffiti-as-cartography search, and the accordion bellows anchor embodied grief. Micro-choices accumulate: copying coordinates, lying down by the gate, stepping into the shallow and counting to twelve. The final act of marking the margin and reframing blame in the field book is earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction reads clean—certainty versus shame—but the therapy-adjacent phrasing "I stopped the pills to hear if my mind still had a river in it" skirts diagnostic label-speak without fully crossing the line.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains abstract throughout; interior texture consists largely of poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist moves through events without embodied resistance or visible micro-choices that foreclose options—receiving letters, following paths, breathing patterns are presented as smooth inevitabilities rather than decisions under pressure. Motivation is declared ("to find the library of unspoken words before silence hardened") but never tested against a competing want or fear that would create authentic tension. The final "becoming a messenger" reads as thematic summary rather than a choice earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilya's interior contradiction—wanting to honor the woman's promise versus accepting the museum's payment—is embodied through concrete gestures (tightening the bow "a hair at a time," tasting the final drop). His choice to play is earned by accumulated pressure from the ferns, the dream, and the ticking noon deadline, and it forecloses the empire path with visible cost (the violin dissolves). The telepathy with plants is used actively in two beats (ferns warning, vines thrumming during play) but reads slightly ornamental in the opening; the trait enables rather than truly constrains with tradeoff cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific to her profession, with embodied detail ("fingers trained to calm chaos") and micro-choices that reveal values (recalibrating the chip despite guild skepticism, listening to silence). Internal contradiction operates through the tension between scientific method and superstition, grief and professional duty. The mentor relationship supplies meaningful backstory that anchors present action, though the final choice to "capture one last spark" feels more like completion of ritual than a path-foreclosing decision with visible cost. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout ("my mouth pull into the small grin she taught me").

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interior life is vivid and embodied through physical action (climbing, pruning, planting scraps). The forgiveness arc is earned across the text, moving from memory through the hairpin's sacrifice to the final acceptance of belonging without ownership. Minor weakness: some moments ("kindly decisive," "I was still meeting") edge toward label-speak rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The final stance—tending rather than capturing—emerges from concrete choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist as "conscience for hire" demonstrates clear professional competence and consistent methodology, with micro-choices visible in the translation of wind chimes and fee negotiation. Lark's "sincerely insincere" contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized—we see her confess vulnerability but not the mask/face tension in live action that would ground the paradox. Interiority remains abstract ("rented doubt and rented faith") without embodied specificity under pressure. The final choice to "speak and set terms" feels procedurally arrived at rather than earned by visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "study disappearance, to learn how to be seen" drives the trance journey and the final choice to "vanish where I hindered." The researcher's backwards aging is vivid but remains primarily atmospheric rather than a constraint that forces hard choices. Internal contradiction appears in the simultaneous desire to be seen and to vanish, though the resolution feels more thematic than embodied in conflicted micro-choices under pressure. The village-by-the-river vision provides a pivot, but the agreement to "release" arrives without visible on-page cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and voice-particular ("let it ricochet sound from bone to bone"), with embodied perception that narrows under pressure. The apprenticeship and reverence motives ground the character's expertise, and the final choice to leave stones for "the next listener" carries visible cost—foregoing tools and accepting emptiness. However, the reflective density dominates most beats, and the protagonist's physical micro-choices remain sparse; the shift from active skimming to stillness is thematically clear but emotionally underdramatized, limiting the felt weight of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc is well-grounded: underachieving mage fleeing automation, testing the spire's light, then returning to street-level practice. Micro-choices accumulate (testing mist walking, placing keystone, tugging to flex platform, removing it to refuse ownership) and reveal contradictory impulses—seeking validation yet refusing to harvest the moment. Embodied emotion appears in "cold rang like a tiny bell in my teeth," though some beats lean on stock phrases ("hands burning in the wind"). The final shift to "patient caretaker of questions" is earned by the sequence of refusals and small attentions, and the recurring climbs signal endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lamplighter's interiority is concrete and particular—"the sort of person who hides behind truth, hoping it will shield me from its shadow"—and the vow at closure forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied contradiction appears in the descent ("ease of someone who has practiced leaving") and the final promise binds without sentimentality. Micro-choices (touching pages, mouthing the vow, pressing the tag) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Minor: the protagonist's internal stance is consistently contemplative, which limits friction, but the renunciation at closure earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's decision-making through coin-flipping is internally consistent and embodied ("I steadied my hands," "the old shame of my title fall away"), with contradictory impulses present—shame versus acceptance of randomization as method. Sori is thinly sketched but her "quietly enthusiastic" stance and "hummed beneath her breath" provide texture. The final choice to flip remaining coins and tune to intervals earns the closure without full interiority of stakes-under-pressure. Emotional vocabulary occasionally borders on label-speak ("stellar doubt pooled") but remains mostly concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper's grief is embodied through concrete action—climbing stairs, handling the atlas, speaking to glass creatures—and his motivation to name fears is earned by Miren's loss. Internal contradiction surfaces when "gentleness broke him" and he continues the work despite feeling no triumph. The final micro-choice to draw a harbor shows value hierarchy with visible cost (accepting incompleteness, bowing to failure). Minor deduction: the interior voice occasionally drifts toward elevated poetic register that slightly exceeds what the mourning reaper would articulate mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Efan's "lukewarm" steadiness is embodied through concrete micro-choices—hanging the bell, counting drips, tying seaweed threads—that show capability balanced with uncertainty. His internal contradiction ("devotion stayed brittle...cradled it with uncertain hands") acts simultaneously in scene rather than alternating in summary. The fisherman's presence adds pressure through witness and dialogue that forces Efan to articulate his stake. Minor slip: "earnestly naive" is declared early but not tested by a mistake that compounds before resolution, keeping the piece just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The warden's motivation to preserve collective memory is clear and drives his radio call to gather former residents, but interiority often leans on abstraction ("an ache he cannot place," "memory behaves like undertow"). The micro-choices—pocketing the label, following the photographs, calling the volunteer group—show agency, yet the internal contradictions remain lightly sketched rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to "not expunge the story" arrives with visible cost (defying the bureau), but the emotional terrain leading there feels more asserted than embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Iri's interiority is vivid and embodied—"The frozen dew crystal chimed faintly, a bell of winter inside summer"—but her motivations remain abstract. The decision to bury the reliquary and refuse to recite formulas is signaled but not earned through visible internal conflict or contradiction; we see her choose, but the pressure that narrows the choice to this specific act is told through reflection ("she felt there was neither arithmetic nor dream, but their handshake") rather than dramatized as a micro-choice under duress. The grandmother's voice arriving "not from memory, but from the math of birds and the mercy of water" risks unearned epiphany without prior on-page struggle that would make this moment credible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied—knees echoing vortex shape, testing buckles through gloves, tapping codes into rails. Internal conflict is live: the burden of trust versus self-doubt after a prior failure, crystallized in "asking whether I have seen enough to trust my own invention." The prior glider accident and the scar that neither crosses give genuine stakes to the relationship with the pilot. Micro-choices—setting lanterns to green-blue, tapping the revised message, leaning with the ship—reveal values under pressure, though the final nod feels slightly under-dramatized given the weight carried.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. Neri and Rae receive vivid sensory tags ("never met a mirror she could not forgive," "laugh had once broken a tyrant") but their choices in the sparring test feel choreographed to demonstrate complementary opposites rather than arising from distinct internal conflicts. The final joint-custody decision registers as thematic assertion—"choosing them together finally gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness"—rather than a choice earned by the narrator wrestling with competing values on the page. Interiority leans toward abstract meditation ("the blade of attention slices through pretense") without micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of wants in friction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conductor's motivation is clear—restore laughter to a grieving household—but interiority is abstract and labeled ("mournfully eager") rather than embodied. Internal conflict is declared poetically ("skewed but honest about the missing") yet never acts in scene as contradictory impulses forcing a live trade-off. The final moment shows endurance rather than a forecloses choice with visible cost; the conductor simply finishes his performance without confronting a credible obstacle or renunciation on the page. Micro-choices are atmospheric gestures—kissing the pull cord, adjusting tempo—that texture the ritual but don't narrow options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's dimensional homesickness and waiting-as-binding drive interior contradiction, and the final choice to "interiorize the garden" is earned by prior causality. However, the guardian remains more cipher than character—her decisions (offering the pendant test, teaching frostbite reading) emerge from archetype rather than individuated motive. Interiority is densely figurative but occasionally slides into label-only abstraction ("dialect of erasure") without embodied cost in the moment. The core renunciation (leaving by not leaving) forecloses external departure with visible cost, meeting the Earned Stasis threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is highly specific and embodied ("my chest rose as if to spend it," "my skin told the heat my name"), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—reverence for the bishop's authority versus the need to destroy it. The choice to break the crozier and feed it to the flames is earned through cumulative micro-decisions (salt adjustments, bellows control) that narrow options with visible cost. Minor deduction: the reflection on the bishop and childhood destiny approaches expository summary in places, slightly flattening present pressure, but the core arc from ward to self-authored agent remains credible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist shows a distinct perceptual signature—"testing wonders with calipers and stories with solder"—and makes meaningful micro-choices (discarding assumptions, pressing the hush shard to the mast, threading the star fragment). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in lines like "I stopped naming the blinking, and the blinking stopped lying to me." However, the celestial signal interpreter's professional expertise remains somewhat abstract; we see the role's poetry more than its mechanical friction. The ending choice feels earned by the city's instruction and the protagonist's shift in stance, with visible cost in the act of placement and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The deckhand protagonist demonstrates clear motivation (yearning for permanence amid transience) and makes active choices in the grotto—aligning patterns with the broom, instructing the helmsman, choosing which threshold to cross. Internal contradiction appears when the voice says "you are tired of losing arrivals" and the protagonist whispers yes, embodying the want/need tension. However, the character's transformation relies heavily on symbolic action rather than dramatized emotional cost; the final state feels more asserted than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The architect's discipline and project are clear, and his choices (anchoring the thread, drawing lines, circling the curator) drive the forward motion. Interiority remains abstract—"weaving patterns of attention," "felt anger erupt quietly"—rather than rooted in embodied sensation or contradiction acting in scene. The curator's arc is muted; she observes and asks questions but undergoes no visible shift or cost. The final exchange ("habits are artifacts worn on the inside") reads as mutual epiphany without prior struggle to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The instructor's interiority is concrete and particular—touching the chain link, running alien exercises at night, volunteering for night crawls—showing a mind shaped by years of navigation training now confronted by something beyond sonar. The desire to "let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall" reflects earned wonder rather than assertion. However, the transformation from tracing trenches on scrolls to bowing with open palms in recognition feels more stated than dramatized through contradiction or costly choice in scene. The final insight arrives as a perceptual gift rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and distinctive—"listening becomes a structure I can walk through"—with embodied sensory experience and micro-choices that reveal character under pressure. The protagonist's curiosity drives concrete actions (pulling catalogs, following pulses, entering the gallery) that narrow options and lead to connection. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator initially misreads the photograph (listening vs. laughing), though the final choice to guide both parties feels somewhat passive rather than a full renunciation or decisive stance shift. The cost is present but oblique: "incidental heroism, nothing I intended" softens the weight of what was risked or forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's claustrophobic compulsion is embodied through concrete sensory choices—"belly against rock, breath rationed"—and internal contradiction drives the journey (fear versus compulsion to Return). The final renunciation of the gold fleck is earned through the archive moment where she sees her own name and the note "Return when you can bear the room," creating a visible cost. Minor tension: the phrase "tracks invisible things" edges toward a label when it could be more deeply woven into micro-choices earlier, but the escalation through the facility and the choice to leave the fleck ground the arc solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied—counting heartbeats as both coping mechanism and constraint, the porcelain shard as tactile anchor. Internal contradiction operates throughout: "I came back to fetch wisdom from failure, not to argue with shadows, yet shadows know where the hinges are." The digital ghost conversation feels slightly performed rather than discovered, and the mentor's voice shift arrives without sufficient groundwork, but the final choice to "let the signal fade until only my breath, my pulse, my choosing remain" earns the renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The copper-veined storyteller maintains a consistent voice and perceptual filter—notice of texture, attention to echo-tunnel physics, calibration to bird-flight patterns—that shapes each tactical choice. Internal contradiction appears in the curse-fear versus task-commitment dynamic, and the sacrifice of the "travel-name" forecloses a path with visible cost. However, the interiority leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("throat it had once betrayed," "ringing cavity") rather than embodied sensation, and key emotional beats—offering the name, quieting the curse with dead names—are told in summary rather than dramatized with micro-choices that show hesitation or consequence unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's mission ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") operates as a stated motive but remains abstract until the descent; the decision to plant the arrowhead and descend arrives late without sufficient prior tension between competing impulses. Interiority leans heavily on poetic register ("ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose") that sounds crafted rather than character-particular. The herbalist's "patience that tasted like iron" and the protagonist's choice to stay ("keeper who would laugh with them while being remade") show embodied contradiction, but the final acceptance feels inevitable rather than earned by a visible internal struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The violinist protagonist shows consistent motivation (reawakening beauty) and embodied emotion through musical choices under pressure. Internal conflict operates through the tension between obvious longing and the need for restraint, with the heart-rhythm signaling emerging as a concrete micro-choice. However, the statues' shift from threat to receptive audience feels insufficiently earned—their "joints unclenched" without clear dramatization of what internal contradiction or limit they faced. The protagonist's arc lands but the secondary agents (statues, orchard) lack sufficient resistance to make the final transformation feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mailman's interior voice is distinct and poetic, with contradictory impulses visible in "respectfully rebellious" and the tension between regulations and street needs. Embodied choices appear in staying with Mina despite risk, and the final delivery to the boy shows values hierarchy with cost. Minor slip: the transformation feels more cumulative than decisively earned by a single on-page crisis that forces irreversible change. Interiority occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction ("promises break because we wrap them around the wrong emptiness") rather than urgent embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carpenter's interiority is consistent and embodied through action—sanding, routing, listening to the train's breath. His silence is treated as a character trait with cost: he must choose to sing despite being "the silent carousel carpenter," and that choice drives the climax. The supporting cast (travelers, child) remain gestural and apply light pressure but don't muddy the protagonist's agency. Minor deduction: his motivation to "interpret silence as possibility" is asserted early but never tested by a competing want or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The librarian's interiority is concrete and specific—rubbing the scarf's "frayed edge like a coastline of silk," carrying "tide" in pockets—with choices (stepping between shelves, filing the card under "Promise, Noted") that foreclose exploration with visible cost. Contradiction operates subtly: seeking warmth through mathematics while acknowledging "shocks never know when to stop." The mentor backstory anchors present choices without flattening momentum. Minor: the boy and woman remain observational props rather than pressure sources, and the final stance crystallizes more through lyric accretion than a single foregrounded choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian POV is consistent and the voice maintains character-particular perception throughout ("kept a watercolor palette…for catching the wash of first light"). Interiority is heavily lyric and relies on figurative language rather than embodied contradiction; the decision to "escort to its border" and "let it run into morning" shows stance but feels more declared than wrestled. The dream's agency overshadows protagonist struggle; the librarian observes and follows more than fights internal conflict. Micro-choices exist but lack visible tradeoff cost that would elevate character work into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal state is consistently rendered through metaphorical perception ("fog trapped in a jar"), and the decision to sing despite fear is earned by prior beats. However, the locksmith remains externalized—his choices are presented as enigmatic actions without visible internal contradiction or cost. The mother appears only as conceptual presence, not a second character exerting pressure. Minor deduction for the lack of embodied struggle in the locksmith's arc and the abstract treatment of fear as sentinel rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("hands-on folklorist, chronically curious"), with embodied emotion in peak moments (biting the apple, tracing ink with warmth not hers). Internal contradiction appears in the confession about loving work more than the woman holding the anchor rope, showing genuine cost. The final choice—writing grandmother's name a third time—feels earned by the underwater recovery sequence, though the grandmother remains more motif than pressure-applying presence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's interior voice is distinct and their motivation ("to mentor resilience quietly") drives micro-choices across multiple beats—pouring tea, annotating margins, pacing backwards under stress. Embodied emotion appears in "the heat in my chest," and the child's arc from silence to reading aloud earns the ending's stance crystallization. Minor deduction: the council members remain functional pressure without individuated interiority, and some figurative language ("bruise remembering light") risks obscuring embodied reaction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's interior world is vivid and particular—she "felt insatiably creative" when the orchard asks for "a new kind of gesture"—but the motivational arc lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. The child interaction adds a second character and pressure, yet Miren's choices flow without visible internal friction or cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion appears ("Wind braided mist into her hair"), but the peak choice to plant the seed feels preordained rather than torn from competing desires. The piece reads as lyric observation more than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The restorer protagonist demonstrates agency through concrete choices (introducing the needle, whispering the pier hymn, sealing the mask), and interiority is embodied through tactile perception ("hummed against my skin"). However, internal conflict remains muted—the work proceeds without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The caretaker is present but applies minimal pressure; their collaboration reads cooperative rather than crucible-forged, and no hierarchy of values is tested with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's perceptual signature—"methodically curious" map framer—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices: comparing footage, tracing seams, promising village gathering. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and filters observation through professional discipline ("listen before I pin anything down," "the way a framer listens for the right bevel"). The verger functions as credible secondary pressure with his exhausted shrug "that tried to be refusal and failed." Minor slip: the final stance feels more curator than framer—no on-page cost to the professional identity itself, though gratitude and the mat-cutting anchor the trade.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular ("first name basis with death," "quietly analytic patience"), with embodied perception filtering the wreck through professional detachment layered over grief. Micro-choices—pausing to film the snow globe, copying Morse annotations with protective roundness, the two deliberate pulls on the line—reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between clinical cataloging and the impulse to "mother the past," though the final choice to surface with the snow globe feels slightly under-motivated given the professional frame. The cost of staying versus leaving is articulated but not deeply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The balladeer's interior texture is vivid and particular—"driftingly alert," patient for echo, translating through improvised tools. The choice to bolt the plate and "listen" shapes the ghost encounter and the courtyard's transformation. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between former loudness and current quiet truth, embodied in "thirst that had learned to sing quietly." Minor weaknesses: the grandmother's flower-press backstory arrives late and feels ornamental rather than causally wound into present stakes; the balladeer's specific flaws (beyond being "seldom-heard") remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is distinctive and consistent—warmly inquisitive stance embodied through physical interaction with objects and the elevator itself. The affection toward machinery ("let my voice hum small reassurances to the bolts") grounds motivation in micro-choices. However, interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("pain is a folded letter") that reads more thematic than character-particular under pressure. The final choice to leave the diary open and arrange the letters is earned by the accumulative stance, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The aviation meteorologist's interiority is distinctive and embodied through sensory particulars ("engine oil and cinnamon tea," tactile engagement with the telescope and line). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional measurement and emotional categorization, driving the choice to persist with the unorthodox method. The father's absence functions as a concrete motivational driver that shapes present choices rather than static backstory. Minor slip: the final reconciliation with the captain feels slightly rushed, but the core arc—validation of the emotional taxonomy—lands with credible cost (professional risk, isolation).

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's prosopagnosia is organically integrated as both trait and method—reading by edges, weights, and pressure rather than faces—and this perceptual mode drives the coin-reading and mural-painting beats. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the artist's long-held dream and the ticking countdown, embodied in careful breath and slowed heartbeat. The final choice to sign with the coin and hide the letter is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the building falls, the artist stays). Minor deduction: the guild master's voice in the letter occasionally edges toward thematic instruction rather than character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The apprentice's interior is richly specific—"sleep under charts and wake with compass dust on my cheek"—and embodied choices under pressure (brewing tea, pinning the dog-ear, kneeling to trace the hopscotch) convey diligent curiosity without label-speak. The shift from passive observation to active problem-solving (ringing the bell, asking for trust, steering) shows earned agency. Interiority remains concrete throughout; the visceral "ribs were lantern slats and my hands rang like bowls" avoids therapy-speak and grounds emotion in sensation. No secondary character pressure on the page limits relationship crucible; the helmsman is functional rather than a source of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    The locksmith carries a consistent interior goal—to repair not just locks but time and memory—but the story operates at such elevated metaphoric distance that micro-choices under pressure remain abstract. Emotional embodiment is sparse: we are told of "driftwood nostalgia" and "breath" but never shown contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist adjusts gears and springs without visible internal conflict or a dramatized cost that forecloses a path. The ending declares mutual repair but does not earn it through prior struggle or a hierarchy of values tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The collective "we" POV lacks individual interiority or contradictory impulses; the narrator remains a uniform chorus throughout. Lio's altruism is declared but never tested by competing motives or cost. The arch-rescue crisis compels orchestrated effort, but no micro-choices reveal hierarchies of value or character-specific embodiment. The final launch reads as group consensus without visible individual sacrifice or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and particular—"bruised awe lived under my ribs," the mother's words as "a useful gear"—and the work is embodied through glove-feel and filing. However, the protagonist's stance remains static across the entire piece; there is no visible internal contradiction or choice under pressure that forecloses a path with cost. The final action (singing the lullaby) feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing impulses, and no meaningful change or renunciation occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and embodied through specificity ("thorned halo," "numbers lived in my throat"), and micro-choices under pressure are legible (teaching the boy about the nut, coaxing doorways from absence). Internal contradiction operates subtly—dutiful yet resentful—and the final choice to stay after guiding them out carries visible cost ("the orchard loosened its hold, just a little"). One small slip: the woman and boy remain functional vessels rather than individuated presences, though this fits the short scope and single-POV lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently embodied through sensory perception (river foam on wet stones, chrysalis in palm) and the "symphonically minded" trait alters how she processes water and polymer design. Internal contradiction operates when she claims atonement but acknowledges "there was more, a listening that had guided me since childhood," showing competing drives. The final choice to carry the chrysalis "into every meeting" and return with "a plan that would change the plant" is earned by the river's teaching, though the shift from confession-avoidance to public action could bear more on-page friction. Minor deduction: the sister and mentor remain abstract pressures rather than embodied presences that test her resolve in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vendor protagonist has a distinct perceptual filter (moonlight for proofreading, counting absences), but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The quest to find "the place where stories begin" drives concrete choices (following the map, pouring moonlight), and the final acceptance of the comma-seed shows agency with cost. However, the central motivation remains somewhat allegorical; the vendor's personal stake beyond professional curiosity is never dramatized, which keeps emotional embodiment at a remove.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chef's interiority is vivid and embodied ("mouth full of borrowed thunder," jaw aching "like old rope"), with concrete micro-choices (letting the filament touch, whispering to the coral, tasting the broth). Internal conflict appears—caution vs. transformative impulse—but the keeper's memory intrusion feels more told than earned through prior dramatization. The final change (keeper standing taller, memory subsumed) registers but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat; the progression reads more therapeutic than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's core trait—"empathetically decisive"—is labeled but not tested under pressure; we see her coordinate and coach, yet no scene dramatizes a choice where empathy conflicts with decisiveness at visible cost. Her interiority remains abstract ("feels the pull like a tide") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The grain elevator's personification and the townspeople function as chorus rather than sources of friction that force Mara into a renunciating or foreclosing decision. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The helix-minded engineer's interiority is richly embodied through concrete actions (adjusting mirror, mapping lichen, calibrating by crickets) and specific sensory detail. However, key choices—especially the decision to modify circuitry through synaptic plasticity—feel more enacted than struggled over; we witness ceremonial action without seeing the protagonist wrestle with competing impulses or costs before committing. The colleague memory and the child encounter offer layered texture, but the protagonist's emotional progression remains smooth rather than contradictory under pressure. Micro-choices exist but don't visibly foreclose paths with immediate felt cost until the final acceptance of the shattered mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prism-minded archivist maintains a consistent interior lens—angles, refraction, vigilance—through specific micro-choices (trying crowns, refusing glitter, staring at absences). Embodied emotion appears in tactile beats ("iron band warms with consensus," "safes reopened in my ribs"), but the protagonist's journey reads more as a tour through wonders than a struggle with contradictory impulses. The final choice to "leave with safes reopened" and "say nothing" carries thematic weight but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative that would demonstrate internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior world is richly textured ("empathy in motion guiding my hands," sensory tuning to stress cracks) and the renunciation of symphonic ambition for a pulse feels earned by the grove's teaching. However, the character remains more receptor than agent—decisions flow from listening rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is present ("careful breaths," "whisper thanks") but the protagonist's flaws and limits never generate costly mistakes that compound pressure. The final choice to leave the insulator as a promise reads as gentle closure but lacks the visible internal friction that would elevate this to high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The exiled tutor's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"faith is another kind of counting," the basalt stone as thumb-worn anchor. Internal contradiction surfaces when he frames stalemate as mercy yet faces judgment again, and the final surrender-as-song choice feels earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the girl's silence is more device than character with her own contradictory impulses, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's voice is distinctive and consistent—theatrical, precise, lyrical—and interiority is embodied through micro-choices (opening the window, circling the bowl, waiting before lifting the cover). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between "reluctant performer" and the overt theatrical stance, though it could deepen further. The choice to inherit Anya's promise and continue the catalog is earned by prior reflection and the clasp-opening sequence, creating visible cost (accepting a legacy of patient listening). Minor slip: the pacifist stance is declared more than tested under pressure within this single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The herbalist's ambition and sensitivity are established early and shape key choices (planting the seed, inhaling the stink to "map every note"). Internal contradiction appears when ambition encounters village fear, and the final shift from "ambition softened into stewardship" feels earned by the on-page work. However, interiority occasionally slips into elevated register ("olfactorily sensitive, cursed and blessed") and the embodied struggle at peak moments (the bloom unfurling) leans descriptive rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly textured through embodied perception ("heart tight," "skin prickles") and the grandmother's legacy provides clear motivation. However, the journey reads more as observation than decision-driven pressure—the pilot follows water flows and responds to phenomena without facing contradictory impulses or making choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final planting is ritually satisfying but lacks the earned tension of competing wants or a mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The investigator's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven, filtering observations through professional practice ("foresight is not vision but practiced posture"). Micro-choices under pressure—placing tape, uploading offsets, coaching the child—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (time, attention, reputation). The mentor's patch carries embodied weight, and the final inventory choice ("what held and what almost failed") shows professional restraint rather than celebration, reflecting learned discipline. Minor slip: the child's "adult economy" nod feels slightly over-observed for the pressure of the moment, nudging toward label rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell ringer's synesthetic trait is label-only ("hearing blue as a hush, tasting violet as iron") without constraining a single choice under pressure. Interior states remain abstract ("doubt rose," "trust of trapped sunlight") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The motive "to certify wonder as essential" is declared but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost that forecloses a path. The sculptor is present but functionally ornamental, exerting no pressure on the bell ringer's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"I had failed to seal a breach, and the village eastward learned how fragile thresholds could be"—with embodied grief driving the return. Internal conflict surfaces in the contradiction between swearing never to lift the flute again and ultimately using it to weave the seam. The final choice to "gentle the phrase to follow" rather than force it is earned through prior causality and shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost: humility replaces pride. Minor weaknesses: Lane's presence is felt more through assertion ("friends of Lane, or so the part of me that hoped insisted") than dramatized texture, and some reflective passages lean toward summary rather than lived contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is highly specific and voice-consistent—"I listen as them, because I habitually borrow personalities" demonstrates embodied empathy work. The borrowed-Maris stance creates genuine internal tension ("asking me to stop pretending Maris has all the courage I need"). However, the couple's grief arrives pre-packaged and their transformation ("the woman feels his terror as arithmetic") reads more like demonstration of the premise than earned character change. The final confession about using ambiguity to protect oneself offers a micro-choice that forecloses self-deception, meeting baseline cost requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courier's jittery nature is embodied through sensory particulars (pendant trembling, neck prickling) and contradiction—wanting stillness while incapable of it—drives micro-choices. The widow is present but largely reactive; her stroking the tube and breathing into the courier's hands supply pressure without deep interiority. The mentor's absence shapes the courier's method and final loneliness, though the emotional cost of that absence could press harder at closure. Internal voice remains consistent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's perceptual filter is distinct and consistent—"attention is a candle in windy places"—and internal contradictions appear obliquely (claims certainty yet invokes "truthful lies"). Embodied emotion works well in peak beats: Mara's breath trembles, her skepticism drains "petal by petal." However, the climactic moment when Mara presses her palm to the handprint and "her mouth formed the name she swore she would not say again" tells more than it shows; we never see the micro-choice that crosses her threshold, only the narrator's assertion of relief. That absence keeps the change from landing with full earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kio's motivation to send a message is clear and her deliberate weaving process shows purposeful agency. The internal experience remains consistent—wistful, patient, determined—and the final smile signals a shift from longing to completion. However, the character's interiority is overwhelmingly poetic and abstract; concrete micro-choices under pressure are scarce, and the embodied contradictions that would reveal genuine struggle are absent. The renunciation ("she must thin herself") is asserted rather than dramatized through visible cost in a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iven's character is established through consistent meek determination, embodied in his action ("hammering more hope than iron") and the silk tightening only on honest oaths. His trade of easy-day memories for steadiness (naming parents and dog) provides specific internal cost, though interiority remains sparse throughout. The bulk of character work reads as summary rather than scene-level contradictions or micro-choices under pressure; we're told he "listened to stones" and offered bargains, but the moment-to-moment stakes on his person remain muted until the wrist-bruise beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is concrete and specific—"maps are not lines, but scents, textures, vibrations"—and the central choice (accepting culpability for the REDIRECT action) is earned through parallel-universe observation rather than declaration. The embodied emotion arrives through sensory anchors: "the shard warms against my palm, green as planetfall, and I weigh it without flinching." Minor slips: the mother's characterization ("vigilant and indelicate") is told rather than shown, and the child-self lacks contradictory impulses at the pivotal button moment, reading more as mythic echo than conflicted actor.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied—"the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron"—with genuine contradictions between stated preference ("I tell the harbor I prefer the bunk below") and actual behavior. The motivation to protect and pass along safety is rendered through concrete micro-choices: lighting the candle, stacking five stones, reading letters aloud. Minor slip: the previous keeper's drowning and the myth around it feel slightly told rather than fully dramatized as constraint on present choice, but the cost at closure (building stones "for the keeper who never arrives") earns the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator shows distinct voice through perceptual signature ("jokes came true with awkward obedience," "weighted joy that keeps the lantern from tilting"), but remains largely external to pressure—observing and tending rather than facing forced choices with visible cost. The child arrives as coincidence rather than complication earned by prior action, softening agency. Internal contradiction appears in "accidentally prophetic" but never constrains a pivotal choice on the page. Embodied emotion is present ("cheek against green coolness") yet the stakes feel more atmospheric than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dye master's interiority is consistent and anchored in concrete sensory detail—the donor heart's "triple time" and observation of how stories "land on her sleeves the way ash lands on a hearthstone." The motivation to understand story magnetism drives several micro-choices (adjusting the wing, tracking sun trails, brewing indigo steam). However, the final stance crystallization feels more stated than embodied; the heart "slows to listen" and the narrator "feels the heart accept the appointment," but these moments lack contradictory impulses acting in scene. The widow and courier remain functional pressures rather than fully individuated characters with distinct knowledge states.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinth maintenance worker's interiority is concrete and particular—dream dust measured with a tea spoon, grief deconstructed like clogged drains—and the protagonist's progression from mechanical repair to archival witness shows agency under pressure. The final choice to read the tags and log them as angles is earned by prior causality and forecloses the pure maintenance role with visible cost. Minor slip: the trees-as-witness motif occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("trees had watched me more faithfully than people") without immediate embodied contradiction, but the embodied discoveries (root breaching wall, tags as minutes) ground the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scattered memory keeper's interior voice is distinct and purposefully fragmented ("my pieces refuse any other"), with embodied choices in gathering lullabies, threading voices, and opening the loom to communities. The swaddling of grafts and the decision to weave dawn across both mirror-sides show agency under pressure. However, the protagonist's emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; moments like "my courage fluttered like burlap" label state rather than dramatize competing fears and desires colliding in real time, and the final gathering of "scattered selves" arrives as declaration rather than earned through a visible trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied ("knees knew the room and stayed"), and the motivation to learn from shame is concrete. The reunion with the man whose marriage cracked generates genuine internal conflict, though the decision to stay and listen could have been dramatized with more competing impulses acting simultaneously. The protagonist's transformation from hiding to engaging is earned through the library's structure and the paired reading exercise. Minor: some introspection edges toward label-speak ("enlarged tranquility" recurs as a phrase rather than felt state).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and embodied ("I garden the edges like I am speaking softly to a skittish animal"), with micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears subtly when the narrator admits lateness yet proceeds as keeper of memory. The cashier's appearance feels earned through the bread-communion logic, and her biographical sketch (oven crack, rent hike, son's birth) grounds the stakes. Minor deduction: the final choice to return "with a trowel" reads as stated intention rather than foreclosing a path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's role as records chief is established early and their meticulous nature shapes the measuring actions throughout. The mentor's ghost/memory provides some emotional weight, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract—"conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is poetic but never dramatized as a trade-off between competing desires. The final vow-making feels unearned because we never see what the protagonist risks or loses by becoming "another entry" beyond metaphorical dissolution. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling exists in atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lark's motivation is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure (winding the fob, looping the chain around the cutpurse's wrist, paying for the limes) reveal hierarchy of values. Interior texture is distinct—"curiously steadfast, a young spine grown straight by river winds"—and embodied emotion appears in tactile detail (bare feet on the pier, hand on the fob). The watch fob inheritance and father's maps provide backstory that tilts present stance, but the cutpurse's sudden grab feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior setup, and Kettle/smuggler remain functional rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is distinctive and specific ("luminous skeptic," taste-navigation), with clear contradictory impulses (glows with borrowed power yet questions). The arc from doubt to companionship is earned through on-page micro-choices (agreeing to walk with Mirelle, accepting the story). Mirelle's entrance and dialogue reveal character under pressure, though her storm-bearer trait remains somewhat abstract. The ending choice to "carry your story" forecloses solitary skepticism with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The portrait artist's interior is vividly embodied through charcoal-stained hands and mnemonic gift, with contradiction visible in the tension between selling "quick smiles" and suppressed wild creativity. The decision to descend and open the strongbox is motivated by grief and economic survival, and the cost—returning to face Vera's death and their abandoned calling—reads as earned. Minor slip: the faces in crystals "nod as if relieved" edges toward convenient external validation rather than pure internal reckoning, but the choice to bring pages upstairs with Vera's name forecloses the path of pure survival.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The calligrapher POV is consistent with embodied interiority ("I felt my shoulders sag, leaves in shade") and micro-choices under pressure (refusing to gild the lie, withholding service until archives open). Internal contradiction appears when the protagonist both wilts near dishonesty yet enables the vault system by continuing leaf-post work without resistance until discovering the archive. The final choice to force collective opening is earned by accumulated pressure, though the protagonist's shift from passive observation to active lever feels slightly abrupt. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout with leaf-metaphor consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iri's silent stance is character-particular and her renunciation of the Archive Keepers' demand is dramatized through gesture and the sculptures' reply. Internal contradiction appears (guarding wonder versus fearing truth would harden) but remains abstracted rather than embodied in micro-choices under peak pressure. The Keepers' transformation—one weeping, another withdrawing his hand—reads as earned, yet their initial motives remain gestural. The final choice forecloses the path of lending the shard with visible cost (trembling from restrained force), meeting baseline requirements without deep embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android's interiority is consistently embodied through technical metaphors ("circuits crackle with a low snow of memory") and micro-choices under pressure (opening the tin, arranging fears, seeding the burn). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between system compliance and improvised ritual. The final shift—"my memory rooms rearrange, old halls shortening, new doors opening"—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost (breaking protocol, risking system override). Minor deduction: emotional progression occasionally edges toward abstraction ("fragmented wholeness") rather than staying rooted in sensor data and servo action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is distinctive—"I lead through following"—and micro-choices (choosing the locket, waving in the news crew) emerge from a consistent curatorial stance. However, the protagonist remains competent without genuine struggle; no blind spot or mistake compounds before resolution. The courtyard inhabitants are sketched through testimony rather than live pressure, reducing relationship friction. Embodied emotion is present ("hands tucked, mouths open only to breathe through patience") but the collective ritual smooths individual contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator and Mara are established through poetic interiority and embodied movement ("toes sketch treble clefs," "pivot, as a slip to the left"), but their motivation arrives primarily through reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under immediate pressure. The "calm defiance" is declared repeatedly rather than tested in conflicting impulses. The final moment ("a breath that was almost a laugh") offers release but lacks a visible forfeiture or internal contradiction that would earn the shift. Mara's agency is strong in mid-beats (rolling dice, dancing cipher), but the narrator remains primarily observational.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (lighting lamps, seeking memories, exhuming the box). Interior contradictions emerge in the tension between duty and grief, reflected in choices that narrow options (choosing which memory to retrieve). The sister's presence is evoked through specific sensory details (laugh beginning in shoulder, misnamed stars) rather than summary. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that feels slightly above the lantern lighter's plausible lexicon in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The summoner's interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract language ("inward constellations," "unlonely solitude") that distances rather than embodies. The core choice—to "unwrite the future by mapping silence"—unfolds through description and atmosphere rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The fox and brook are observed rather than forcing choices that alter the summoner's stance. Agency reads as atmospheric attunement rather than decision with visible cost; the ending declares success ("the code untied") without dramatizing what the summoner risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's motivation to learn "the language of old buildings" is concrete and drives weekly engagement with the tutor. The progression from borrowed sugar to shared ritual feels earned through specific actions (kettle heat, desk seal pressed into wax). The final choice to accept the seal and "keep listening" carries visible cost—the narrator becomes custodian of the building's grammar and the tutor's elliptical promise. Interior contradiction appears when the narrator both desires answers and accepts ellipsis ("I did not interrogate the grammar"), though the final direct question ("Are you dead") arrives late and the tutor's non-answer maintains ambiguity without full resolution of the narrator's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is densely metaphorical but lacks concrete micro-choices that test contradictory impulses in scene. The "charmed skeptic" stance is told and labeled ("I told the child I was a charmed skeptic") rather than dramatized through on-page decisions that reveal internal conflict. The final acceptance ("I would carry it usefully") arrives without visible hesitation or a dramatized trade-off that would ground the change. Embodied emotion is present in scattered images (winter in chest, pressure like weather) but remains abstract rather than tied to specific bodily sensation or action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The calligrapher-forger POV is filtered through consistent poetic perception—heritage rose thorns, unlinking strokes—but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("wisely enduring," "calibrated treason") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The mentor relationship supplies motive, yet the protagonist's final choice to leave the scroll unfinished feels more thematic assertion than earned renunciation with visible cost. Emotional progression stays contemplative throughout; no degradation under stress or genuine struggle tests the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interiority is vivid and particular ("ears are richly perceptive, but the truer hearing lives where ribs meet"), with consistent embodied perception through sound and water imagery. The character's motivation to understand echoes drives the journey and questioning, and the final choice to "be a knot-maker" carries conceptual weight. However, the resolution arrives through revelatory insight rather than a choice under competing pressures; the protagonist receives answers more than forging them through dramatic conflict. Internal contradiction is present (rope-cutter vs. knot-maker) but plays out largely in reflection rather than simultaneous action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "salvage something pure" drives investigative choices across beats (mapping taps, diving, warming the globe), and the decision to "let people see themselves in the mirror first" carries tactical weight. Interiority feels particular ("I could feel the grid of Sofia's rhythm in my palms"), though the arc from investigation to exposure lacks a visible internal contradiction or trade-off at closure—the narrator executes a plan rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The final gesture (husband turning the crank "until it stuck") offers closure but doesn't foreclose a path for the protagonist with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The net-mender philosopher maintains consistent interiority through embodied perception—"fingers mapping hidden patterns," grief "coaxed into spirals"—and micro-choices that reveal values (giving the whisk to the watching child). Internal contradiction appears when demure audacity drives the public demonstration despite town skepticism. The councilor's arc from dismissal to participation is earned through witnessed specificity rather than assertion, though his transformation accelerates quickly in the final third. Minor therapy-speak intrusion: "teach me the trick of seeing" reads slightly diagnostic but remains anchored in concrete tea-foam observation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator exhibits a distinct perceptual signature ("sharply observant, paid in bottle caps and secrets") with embodied interiority throughout the investigation. Interior logic remains consistent: the protagonist approaches mystery mechanically rather than mythically, and this stance drives each choice from camping in the office to refusing the diamond. The final choice to leave the diamond with the orchard feels earned by the established values, though the love-note detail in the penultimate beats reads slightly convenient rather than organically discovered. Minor deduction for the convenience of that affective token, but the arc from debunker to mechanic-priest holds with visible cost (walking away no richer, having traded curse for calibration).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator exhibits consistent voice and motive ("lonely visionary," debt to storms), with embodied choices (brewing tea, tuning radio, meeting Brin). Internal contradiction appears when the narrator acknowledges "sin" yet proceeds, and Brin's "honest traitor" hunger creates interpersonal pressure. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract ("biography of weather") without micro-choices showing cost in the moment. The closure choice—scattering seeds into lightning—feels earned by prior radio instructions and Brin's arrival, but the final turn lacks visible forfeiture that would anchor the decision's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vagrant poet's interiority is richly embodied through sensory action—jarring sounds, winding the music box—and the final choice to "keep capturing sounds...only until the village learned to cup its own palms" shows renunciation with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when he claims to hold air together yet fears his trade is obsolete, driving the arc. Minor slip: the widow and village remain lightly sketched, functioning more as pressure sources than fully realized secondary characters, but at this length and with clear spatial choreography that is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's "logically emotional" trait is stated but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The seeker's arc from hunger to collaboration feels compressed; her shift occurs through exposition ("my village drowned... but the village also learned") rather than dramatized internal conflict. The key-weighing moment gestures toward hierarchy of values but arrives late. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("storms behave like creditors") that distances rather than grounds emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is lyric-specific ("unyoke another yapping urgency," "ears tuned to the slow thunder under the ice") with embodied contradictions between vigilance and patience. The girl's arrival and the village men provide on-page pressure, but their interior lives remain flat; the girl "smiled like someone untying a knot" reads as label rather than dramatized contradiction. The final teaching moment shows micro-choices (laying maps, gathering the village) that alter present options, though the cost—what the narrator forfeits by committing to this role—remains oblique. Motivation is consistently present but the transformation from solitary mapper to teacher feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The investigator's interior voice is controlled and distinct—"watchfully calm" is embodied through deliberate observation and note-taking rather than labeled. The father's memory and the workers' final minutes are integrated via the lantern's "entangled memories" mechanism, anchoring backstory in present stimuli. Micro-choices accumulate (lifting the lantern, turning off radios, signing the report) and the final renunciation (keeping the lantern, not surrendering it to evidence) forecloses bureaucratic compliance with visible cost. The protagonist's transformation from institutional compliance to fidelity-driven defiance is earned through layered pressure, though the interiority occasionally tilts toward slightly elevated diction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chaplain's interiority is embodied through his listening practice and carries specific contradictions ("lives…harder when the hinges inside them seize"). Jonah is vividly rendered through the apology-as-letters detail and the jaw-clench when offered help. The proprietor's voice is distinct in diction and gesture, though her diagnostic confidence ("Guilt is gravity") flirts with therapeutic abstraction. The final choice—Jonah breathing with the ticking and nodding without asking for mercy—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses passivity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilex's motivation is consistent and his yearning to "ring a bell no one hears yet" drives concrete choices—building the algorithm, testing the cart, adjusting the kaleidoscope. Interiority shows embodied contradiction: "grinned at its refusal to exist" and "denied" the tears. However, the final paragraph's triumph feels too clean; the "tears on his gloves that he denied" is the only visible emotional cost, and the character's confidence never truly wavers under pressure in a way that forecloses a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's arc from compliant archivist to voice-restorer shows clear progression, driven by the "flashlight still burning" framing. Interior work is concrete ("the silence was shaped like a missing person sitting beside me"), but the final choice feels slightly telescoped—the risk of surfacing files and "giving her voice back" is declared more than dramatically embodied in conflicting impulses on the page. Micro-choices accumulate well, yet the climactic decision to post lacks visible hesitation or trade-off that would charge the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator demonstrates consistent interiority through calmly intuitive methods, embodied in the patient mirror work and final proposal. Internal voice remains coherent with poetic specificity ("shadows lace me tighter, a mantle earned by patience"), though some lines ("I am calmly intuitive, my teachers used to say ruefully") edge toward self-conscious labeling. The choice to stay a season and the visible acceptance of the role's weight provide credible endurance with cost. Minor penalty for the direct trait announcement, but the embodied patience and final commitment earn the band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses—arriving to die yet learning to listen for life—are embodied through concrete micro-choices: using the parasol tip to sound ice, asking for delays, moving before panic. Interior texture is specific ("my mind wakes now like a gull on a shifting rail") and emotion is contradictory without therapy-speak. The transformation from suicidal tourist to edge-listener is earned through on-page events (the child rescue, Erland's rope wisdom) with visible cost (the appointment remains, unfilled). Minor deduction: some interiority late in the piece drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("vanishing teaches little unless you learn its preface first") that edges close to diagnostic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sentinel POV is established with embodied detail (letter edge "fragile as moth wings," air tasting "of apple skins"), and the traveler's conflict between rivers and rows is concrete. However, the sentinel's passive role—listening, offering metaphors—limits active internal contradiction. The traveler's final kneeling act earns a micro-choice, but the sentinel's motivation remains more facilitator than participant with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic observation rather than embodied struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper (narrator) demonstrates coherent motivation and embodied presence through ink-work and ritual action. The half-masked line walker shows physical particularity (blackened feet, partial mask) and purposeful action, but his interior remains opaque—he functions more as atmospheric figure than agent with conflicting drives. The prophet is pure absence; his choice to retreat is told rather than dramatized. Micro-choices exist (opening pages, anchoring points, facing away from the path) but lack visible internal cost or contradiction that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist POV carries a distinct perceptual signature ("subtle puzzle archivist, perceptively calm") but interiority remains mostly performance rather than contradiction under pressure. The final choice—leaving the corridor outdoors—is consistent but feels predetermined rather than fought for. Embodied emotion is present ("hands stay perceptively calm, not to hide my own tremble") yet the narrator's own stake never crystallizes into a micro-choice with visible cost. Secondary characters (mayor, fisherman, seamstress, child) apply immediate pressure and the collective healing shapes the stakes, but the protagonist observes and guides without personal risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scholar's interiority is consistently particular ("hand nicked by paper," "weathered innocence"), and his contradictory impulses—hating to speak yet loving to hear—drive the arc. The renunciation of volumes in favor of "the grammar of tending" feels earned by prior reflection. However, the motivation remains largely contemplative rather than tested by competing pressures; no visible trade-off forces a harder choice. The final stance crystallizes but lacks the friction of a decision under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—listening "with the thin bones of his wrists," speaking into welded lips—that grounds interiority in embodied, character-particular choices. The precognitively forgetful trait creates a paradox that pressures actions (arranging markers for his future self, pressing ears to statues), but the contradiction never constrains a pivotal choice with visible cost; he endures rather than decides. The final gesture—resetting markers "for the man who would not recognize them tomorrow"—reads as renunciation with felt cost, yet the cost remains atmospheric rather than forcing a trade-off between competing wants. Minor deduction: the chalk's pocket-drop at line 30 and his gathering it at line 34 feel like micro-movements without dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sage repairer shows competence balanced with genuine problem-solving struggle; the move from diagnosis through micro-adjustments to final insight feels earned. Interior texture is character-specific ("I promised nothing, only that I would restructure") and embodied through tool-handling. The climactic realization about the chronometer burr lands with visible cost—the night's labor—but the protagonist's emotional arc remains somewhat static, with the final memory turn arriving more as lyric meditation than transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The therapist's interior is controlled and purposeful, with embodied detail ("pause to breathe like he does") and micro-choices that alter tactics (peeling the clementine, calling the son). Mr. Ramos and his son show contradictory impulses—the shard wrapped in gauze as both wound and talisman, the son's leaving and returning—that complicate the reunion without neat resolution. The final choice (son taking the shard without gauze) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the therapist's voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("execute a flawless goodbye") but interiority remains character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and purposeful: "quietly deliberate" is demonstrated through careful mirror-arrangement and the nine-fold key turn. Motivation coheres around the central question (where shadows go at noon) and culminates in an earned insight tied to decision-making. The embodied cost—exhaling as the shutters open, the gold line slipping under skin—grounds the change. Minor deduction: the caretaker remains ornamental, applying no pressure beyond handing over the key.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("bone setting, like truth, hurts first and then holds"), with embodied skepticism driving micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: the narrator doubts yet acts with mercy, a stance that earns the final choice to "tell it plain" with visible cost (sheltering Ari while facing town clamor). Ari's shame and Linnet's "shrewdly innocent" presence add secondary pressure, though Linnet's trait remains more labeled than dramatized in choice. The shoulder-setting scene demonstrates professional competence balanced with genuine emotional struggle, and the ending forecloses the witch-tale path with felt relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied through the polishing action, with contradiction between grief (brother, fire) and devotion to slow craft. Micro-choices—selecting glass, testing warmth on tongue—reveal a hierarchy of values. The brother backstory anchors present stance without flattening pressure, and the final choice (offering garland to village) forecloses the quick-fire path with visible cost (patience over spectacle). Emotional progression is realistic, layering mourning with quiet determination.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal voice is distinct and character-particular ("I am a watchful dreamer by practice, not by choice"), with embodied contradictions visible in the choice to keep the pendant while refusing to answer publicly. The micro-choices—mapping the path, preparing words, proffering the necklace—reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The final mutual promise ("I will not make silence from her again") feels earned by prior causality and forecloses paths with visible cost. Minor: some interiority leans abstract ("damage is gentle because it is busy becoming something else") without full grounding in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist's interiority is present through reflection on their work and creative resistance, with embodied detail via the shell fragment. Internal conflict appears between market demands and artistic integrity, though the stakes remain abstract—no concrete micro-choices test this tension under pressure. The parade of cameo characters (courier, grandmother, child) are vivid but remain symbolic vehicles rather than sources of relational pressure. The ending choice to "write them as they wanted to live" reads as resolution but lacks a prior on-page moment where market pressure concretely threatened this stance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rowen is characterized primarily through atmospheric description and repeated metaphorical gestures ("spins golden stories," "pockets of screws and songs") rather than contradictory impulses or on-page choices under pressure. His motivation to restore practices is declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost—he arrives, performs, and leaves with no visible internal friction. The village collective receives even less interiority; they are a passive chorus that practices until "throats were polished." No choice forecloses a path with felt cost; the ending grants success without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interiority is vivid and image-driven ("fingers inked and singed," "frost traced his eyelashes"), with patience embodied through posture and breath-matching. The sister backstory functions as emotional anchor but risks sentiment; the memory motivates waiting without forcing a present micro-choice that alters tactics. Internal contradiction is absent—he demonstrates singular resolve without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act (fitting the plate, sealing with flash-paper) reads as decision but lacks visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith's interiority is richly embodied through his craft-specific perception ("like a beat missing in a lock's tumblers under tension") and consistent motivation to harvest wonder. His micro-choices—chalking lines, machining gears, sealing jars—reveal a hierarchy of values without label-speak. The final gesture of leaving the timer under rock shows renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: the mentor's belief ("time kept only what sound first taught it") edges toward abstract philosophizing without dramatized friction in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's commitment to weighing griefs is demonstrated through embodied micro-choices (cradling the widow memory, orienting shoulders with the weaver), but interiority often defaults to abstract labels ("recognition that burdens ask to be named with honesty") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final fear—"that love would demand my departure"—arrives with genuine cost and a visible shift in posture, but the resolution feels more like achieving balance than forfeiting a live option. The weaver remains functional but undercharacterized, a facilitator rather than a source of pressure or relationship friction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The widow's interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—"she breathes to their patience," the hand remembering his mirror-practice—and grief manifests through contradictory impulses: refusing to restore the tag's name while carving the collar, allowing memory without treats. Micro-choices (pausing at the knot, not perfecting the collar, leaving the tin shut) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—wrapping the piece, opening the window—earns closure through prior causality. Minor slip: "he is not a ghost…he is the rhythm" borders on articulated insight but recovers by grounding it in action ("choosing what not to fix").

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scavenger's interiority is densely lyric but remains abstract—"motives are simple and unbearable" is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The ghost negotiation involves stated verbs (admit, forgive, rebuild, stay) that feel like a checklist rather than embodied struggle. Micro-choices exist (washing the sack, cataloging ambitions) but carry minimal visible cost that would foreclose a path. The protagonist's agency reads more as allegory than as a character in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The intern's interiority is concrete and particular—"functionally creative" operates as both identity and constraint. The decision to "angle myself toward solutions" with the sextant shows embodied choice-making, and the progression from solitary equations to collaborative mapping with the janitor tracks a genuine arc. Minor weakness: the mother's arrival feels slightly convenient, but the intern's choice to let "the sinks speak mathematics" rather than explain demonstrates earned restraint. Motivation remains consistent and pressure-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    The clock scribe's interiority is richly particular—"glacial hush turn from marble to water under his ribs"—and embodied throughout. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between flight and return, shame and tenderness, but the protagonist's agency remains entirely reflective; no on-page micro-choice under pressure alters tactics or forecloses a live option. The final stance ("keep meeting it, without demand") is articulated rather than dramatized through a concrete act with visible cost. Motivation is consistent but the change reads as contemplative realization, not a decision that narrows paths.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular throughout, with sensory perception grounded in canal work ("lantern glass polished by rain"). Internal conflict operates consistently—the desire for "serenely radical correction" versus the weight of family complicity creates genuine tension. The final choice to partner with the engineer is earned by prior causality, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("serenely I stood in upheaval") that edges into label-speak under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's seed-collector identity is asserted rather than dramatized through difficult choices under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical statements ("infinitely patient in the manner of winters") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. The fisherman's blessing and the protagonist's vigil with the rope lack friction or internal conflict; the task unfolds smoothly without genuine struggle that would test commitment or force trade-offs. The final moment shows the fisherman's relief and mutual listening but no visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation and method are articulated but remain abstract—"projecting presence" and "geography of healing" label rather than embody interiority. The woman client is given concrete emotion ("eyes are archives of low tides"), yet her choice to hire the narrator and accept the pages lacks visible conflict or cost; we see weeping but no trade-off. Micro-choices are minimal; the thread ritual and the bridge-walk feel performed rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prince's interior life is vivid and poetic but often abstracted into metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "reawaken beauty" drives consistent choices, yet the final turn—opening the palace gates and declaring caretaking—feels more like thematic fulfillment than a choice earned by visible internal cost or foreclosed alternatives. Embodied emotion appears in fragments ("heart a metronome of quaking reverie," kneeling as armor slides away) but is diluted by ornamental phrasing. The creature's emergence and his response carry weight, but the lack of a second on-page character to create relational pressure limits the crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior is richly embodied through concrete objects (black sand, coin) that ground her emotional arc, and her choice to teach the boy through grafting rather than scolding shows character-particular compassion. The father's backstory is efficiently threaded through present action and shifts her stance ("unlearned his purpose and kept his skill"). However, the reflection-heavy middle section ("she wanted to prove that scars can sing") abstracts motivation into theme-speak rather than dramatizing conflicted choice, and the boy's agency remains underdeveloped—he nods and follows but does not resist or complicate her teaching with his own need.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ilias is established early with a consistent skeptical-yet-luminous stance and embodied choices (waiting, refusing the broker's offer). Internal conflict appears in "doubt as a way to listen" and the tension between skepticism and faith in sidereal patience. However, interiority often remains abstract rather than contradictory-in-scene; the peak moment of refusal to the broker lacks visible internal friction or cost beyond stating principle. The water woman and broker are functional pressures but remain thin characterizations without their own embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I rub the gear before I sing the clicks, feeling the cold faith of metal"), with embodied contradiction between holding tight and practicing loosening. The protagonist's agency operates through teaching and guiding rather than decisive choice-under-pressure; travelers learn, but the narrator's own stance crystallizes without visible internal conflict. Micro-choices (placing the gear in the child's palm, triggering the petal rain) advance the tutorial without foreclosing a path with felt cost. The piece maintains perceptual consistency but lacks a protagonist arc that alters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gravestone carver's interior life is densely rendered through embodied choices (ribbon selection, chisel pacing, depth calibration responding to the father's steadying hand). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between fierce meditation and the loosening invited by poem marks. The father's arc—choosing his daughter's kite poem, finding breath that does not shatter—earns its Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor deduction: the mother's spectral presence occasionally risks therapy-speak ("lessons arrived as drafts") but mostly stays concrete through butterflies and greenhouse creaks.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The winder's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout: the "searing reverie burning behind my eyes," the physical handling of the pendulum, the confessional inscriptions on the rake handle. Internal contradiction appears in "Precision without regard becomes injury" set against his earlier pride in exactitude, and the cost of past rigidity (the fisherman, the wedding bells) shapes present micro-choices—visiting neighbors, carving names, adjusting with "patience." The father's death anchors grief-driven over-tightening that now loosens into ethical repair. Minor deduction: the transformation from rigidity to listening is thematically strong but the on-page renunciation could be sharper; the pivot happens mostly in reflection rather than a single high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The gardener's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is told rather than dramatized through embodied contradictions. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("velveteen gloom he cannot quite shake") instead of concrete sensory anchors that reveal character under pressure. The final choice to plant poppies and write the widow's name reads as gentle resolution but lacks visible internal cost or foreclosed alternatives. The widow exists only in backstory summary, preventing relationship pressure from testing the protagonist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is consistent and specific—lyric, reflective, charged with professional idiom ("ignorance cartographer," "sustaining transformation"). Embodied emotion appears sporadically (hand trembles, breath at the window), but most pressure is mediated through abstract modeling rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to draw feels pre-decided rather than forged under pressure; the narrator rehearses rationale without visible struggle that would elevate agency. Micro-choices exist (placing hinges, drafting the legend) but the path feels deliberative rather than agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The copyist protagonist shows consistent interior life through embodied devotion to their craft, moving from numbering rests to teaching dust its grammar. The motivation to restore story after famine is sustained through micro-choices: tuning the radio, tapping pencil to establish common time, scattering ash over pages. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between trained precision and the improvisational demands of the pirate broadcast. The final choice to sleep "keeping time, because stories deserve a conductor who listens first" earns the stance with visible devotion-cost, though the character remains more observer than agent in key reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven—"I am a charcoal portrait ash scatterer" establishes both occupation and symbolic stance. Mother's gesture ("nods toward the chest") and wrist-squeeze at the end embody contradiction and cost without therapy-speak. The final exchange—"I understand the cost of surviving without a witness"—lands as earned insight rooted in prior silence and the chair's rhythm. Minor slip: the narrator's micro-choices feel more curatorial than internally conflicted until the gallery scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and distinctive—"the scream has already happened" establishes embodied post-trauma stance. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the ache to agonize and the choice to act ("rebellion is a lever, not a pose"), and micro-choices under pressure (holding up the cog, leading them through the tunnel) reveal hierarchy of values. The protagonist's competence is balanced with genuine stakes (the flood will kill while they argue), and the final choice to keep the cog demonstrates earned stance crystallization with visible cost (the three men's damp narratives suggest social consequences). Minor: the philosopher-among-rats frame risks pose over pressure, but the on-page hydraulic crisis rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in prior wounds ("I had once shouted for a cause until my throat bled"), and the piece embodies her pedagogical philosophy through concrete micro-choices (placing the rosette, denoting rests). However, the choir students remain largely interchangeable despite gestural tags (Rafi's "smoke," Ola's "tremble"), and their individual arcs are summarized rather than dramatized in choice-moments. The ending image of passing the rosette is gesture-rich but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path that would anchor Earned Stasis or Charged Poise with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chef protagonist shows a coherent interior logic—tasting memories as a form of embodied perception—and makes micro-choices that advance pressure (clearing soil, pruning shoots, calling neighbors). Motivations are rooted in craft and community repair, though some interiority leans toward label-speak ("informally wise") rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The final choice (ladling broth, inviting neighbors) forecloses isolation with visible cost (exposure, vulnerability), but the protagonist's internal conflict could deepen further; the piece leans more on demonstration than genuine self-doubt under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The toll keeper's involuntary truthfulness is established early and consistently shapes micro-choices ("truth pinned my tongue and freed my hands," "truth spoke ahead of me"). The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible where the keeper's desire to preserve wonder conflicts with urgency, creating embodied tension. Interiority remains concrete and voice-specific ("stubborn desire to preserve wonder in routine"), though the final choice to reveal the hidden tray feels slightly under-motivated—the keeper's resistance isn't dramatized enough to make the release feel costly. Minor deduction for the trait operating more as flavor than as a binding constraint at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's particularized way of noticing ("creeping normality noticer," observation through displaced objects) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Interiority remains concrete through embodied observation (orris shard warming, hands trembling), though some moments veer toward diagnostic self-awareness ("I called that seam a shard of hush"). The motivation to understand aliveness in houses drives choices across three encounters, but the final realization feels slightly over-articulated rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The costs remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Oris is given a distinct perceptual signature—thinking in quiet, speaking through water—and demonstrates contradictory impulses (certainty vs. welcoming nuance) that drive on-page choices. The interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays embodied through concrete actions: threading the ampoule, touching coral, sweeping anemones. The scholar above functions as secondary pressure, her recoil and eventual shift earned by Oris's demonstration. Minor slip: the founder statue's bow and the scholar's final nod feel slightly convenient, but the core arc—moving from simple truth to layered revelation—remains motivated and costs Oris the comfort of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses—hopeful persistence versus sober measurement—are embodied throughout the climb and dice rolls, not merely stated. The chipped die serves as a physical correlate to internal bias, and the choice to keep the chip rather than correct it demonstrates coherent self-knowledge. The final stance (agreement as accuracy becoming mercy) emerges from sustained engagement with regret and attention. Minor: the "grim optimist" label is stated rather than discovered, and some introspective passages risk over-articulation, but the core contradiction drives meaningful choices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lina's motivation (proving strangers remember kindness) is established early and her nightly painting ritual shows consistent character logic. However, her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"methodically hopeful heart" and "insomnia cooled" tell more than they dramatize. The neighbor's return provides a mild test, but Lina's response (brewing tea, speaking without words) feels like arrival rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority often uses elevated register ("coaxing pictures that were more memory than plan") that reads more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The curator's interiority is concrete and particular ("feeling history tug like a hive-slick rope"), and the internal arc from "I feared becoming embalmer rather than nurse" to "worthy workers are rare, and need is a stern docent" shows genuine contradiction and earned acceptance. Embodied emotion appears in "I woke afraid, ridiculous, hopeful, salt-tongued," moving beyond label-only affect. However, the transformation feels somewhat declared rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under peak pressure; the acceptance of responsibility arrives through exposition ("Responsibility settled on me like nectar armor") rather than a concrete decision moment that forecloses a visible option.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clockmaker's interiority is richly embodied through craft-specific perception ("my hands, neatly inventive, smelled of brass and boat pitch") and contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the climax—desire to transcend fate versus memory of the keeper's voice. The decision to "let the yoyo climb" and choose "the keeper, the unbroken tide" is earned by prior causality and forecloses the supernatural path with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional label-only emotional states ("bleak exhilaration") that edge toward diagnostic phrasing, though the embodied particulars mostly compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is vividly embodied through concrete, surreal details ("chest still ticked," "photographically cursed") and the relationship with the advisor generates consistent pressure. Motivations are clearly rooted in fear and debt, driving choices through the funhouse sequence. However, the advisor's agency overwhelms the narrator's at key turns—he orchestrates the plan, supplies the clasp, and operates the camera—reducing the protagonist's role to compliant execution rather than contradictory struggle. The final choice feels dictated rather than earned through internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist exhibits a clear, consistent internal logic: interpreting environment through sound and converting threat into instrument. Embodied choices are visible throughout ("I lifted the xylophone mallet," "I struck in D"). The final sitting among pears after the storm demonstrates earned endurance with cost (exhaustion, watchfulness). Minor deduction: some interior moves ("I needed a counterstory big enough") edge toward declaration rather than dramatized contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (reading the tag, playing the whistle notes, stepping into the corridor). Interiority carries a distinct texture—"questions rot if kept"—and the final choice to step into the glare feels earned by the cumulative pressure of inheritance and obligation. Minor slip: the mother's expedition functions more as backstory weight than as a lived contradiction that complicates present action in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's voice is consistent and specific—"emotionally rational" operates as both description and constraint when they choose to "tell the truth without contempt" rather than adopt noble lies. The internal conflict between mercy and truth runs through the piece, forcing micro-choices (copying names, writing "Listen," deciding to publish methodology). Interiority stays concrete and particular: "the only way an emotionally rational mind can: tell the truth without contempt, and let mercy arrive as consequence, not premise." The final gesture—delivering the ledger to families—demonstrates agency with cost, though the reflection-heavy mode means key decisions appear more as resolved stances than pressure-tested turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The surveyor's interiority is richly embodied—"boots remembering former thresholds," "firmness is how I hold the trembling"—and the paradox of "Stoically Sensitive" generates genuine tension between restraint and emotional investment. The motivation to "touch what sank and catalog the way emptiness braids itself through what remains" drives concrete micro-choices: wresting the door, placing notes, copying names. Minor deduction: the character's internal contradictions are articulated more than enacted under pressure; the piece leans toward contemplation rather than dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ossa's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("soft bruise of its weight, the way a promise leans"), with clear motivation rooted in intellectual integrity. The arc from patient observation to active testing of doctrine is earned through embodied perception (stamp's weight, violet ink, cracked pearwood). Minor limitation: the protagonist operates largely alone, so relational pressure and contradictory impulses remain muted; the choice to hide the stamp feels like preservation rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lantern maker's goal (retrieve his shadow through origami cranes) is signaled early and drives action, but his interior life remains abstract—grief is labeled "luminous torment" and "ache" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shadow's detachment night is told rather than dramatized, weakening the felt cost of his journey. At closure, the shadow "loosens" rather than returns, a renunciation with some cost, but the protagonist's internal contradiction (clinging vs. releasing) never surfaces in a pivotal beat. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the hoarse laugh), but much interiority relies on metaphor rather than specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and character-specific ("bleak exhilaration is honest, and honesty is the only fuel I trust anymore"), with embodied emotion tied to the geode crystal's throb. Motivation is clear—hunting unused potential as a post-trauma quest—and the final vow to "remain awake, to keep the measure open and unclean" feels like earned endurance with visible cost. Minor slip: the transformation relies heavily on stance crystallization rather than a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path; the ending reads as Charged Poise but lacks a sharper on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The drone pilot POV maintains consistent perceptual texture (observation-driven vocabulary, attention to pattern and legibility). The pilgrim remains opaque throughout—interior access is withheld entirely, reducing relational pressure to a series of declarations rather than embodied stakes. "Perpetually surprised" appears three times but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choice with visible cost. The final shift ("no longer perpetually surprised") is asserted without dramatized cause, and the pilot's calibration "for kindness" arrives as therapy-speak rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's guilt and self-deception are embodied through concrete choices—manufacturing false memories, withholding the watch hand, bartering truth for cowardice. Internal conflict surfaces in the double awareness ("I told myself I am recording the heart, but the ledger aches with forgery") and drives the shore scene where prior lies are physically confronted. The final renunciation (keeping one page, burning the rest) emerges from accumulated pressure with visible cost. Minor dip: some interiority leans toward diagnostic phrasing ("padded silence with needles still inside"), though it remains grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator's interiority is well-embodied through the drawer pull and the careful navigation of both sides' needs. Micro-choices are visible throughout—showing the pull, untethering the boy, holding silence—each revealing hierarchy of values. The internal contradiction between wanting to "recycle mistakes" and the immediate risk of saying the wrong thing creates authentic tension. Minor deduction: the trait "uncommonly thoughtful" is told rather than purely shown, though subsequent actions support it.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied—the compass "against my ribs," the nickname that "stung," the contradictory impulses to keep ghosts "behind me, or ahead" are concrete and character-specific. The choice to help the boy is earned through the accumulating pressure of remembered navigation skill and the "small galaxies of mud," which ground agency in sensory detail. Minor slips: "merrily melancholic" is asserted early as a label without immediate on-page embodiment, and the backstory of the lost friend, while anchored, occupies substantial space without always tilting present choices. The final micro-choice—pressing the compass to sternum—reads as earned stasis with visible cost (the sorrow carried "open and used").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly established—seeking to "kindle empathy where none remains"—and interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions ("jaded wonder," guilt returning "as steam"). The journey from passive forgetting to active ferrying is earned through the caretaker encounter and the baseball ordeal. However, the final choice to stay lacks visible cost on the page; we're told the ledger "weighed less than water" but see no foreclosed path or immediate sacrifice, blunting the final beat's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's internal landscape is richly textured—"a tide keeps pulling at the ribs where Mira once pressed her night-warm thumbs"—and the final metamorphosis into "a passage, a scent-keeper" carries embodied cost. However, the choice to transform feels inevitable rather than wrestled; the narrator's reluctance dissolves without visible internal friction at the pivot. Mira's agency is thin; she asks the price and places a hand, but her own contradictory impulses never surface, leaving her more catalyst than co-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer's interiority is richly embodied through concrete ritual actions—tracing cracks, naming gestures, pressing palms—that reflect contradictory impulses between guilt and the desire to reclaim time. Internal conflict operates simultaneously: she confesses failures while simultaneously seeking redemption through esoteric ritual. The final choice to "unfasten every future knot" is earned by the chamber descent and embodied confessions, forecloses simple solutions, and carries visible cost. Minor deduction: "willingly perplexed" risks label-speak but is redeemed by concrete puzzlement enacted on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly embodied through the gravitational weight mechanic, which physicalizes emotional states in a character-specific way. Internal contradiction appears in the pacifist caretaker forced to "push open" and the balance between joy and grief that must act simultaneously rather than sequentially. The shadow-work beat in the greenhouse ("naming the angers I never used") dramatizes genuine self-confrontation with visible micro-choices. Minor slip: a few moments edge toward therapy-speak ("shadow work," "workable buoyancy") but recover quickly through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal contradiction—between fearing vanity in prophecy fulfillment and orchestrating safety—acts throughout the piece and shapes her stance at closure. Embodied emotion is sparse; most affect appears in labels ("prickle of embarrassment") or generic states. The decision to free the lightning bugs carries conceptual cost but minimal visible struggle on the page. Secondary characters (fisherman, volcanologist, child) apply pressure but remain functional archetypes without distinct interior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is evocative and consistent—"I am calmly inventive" filters perception and choice. However, motivation relies heavily on told backstory ("She called the workshops below the cradle of sparks") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to invite Rhun feels abrupt; his nod lacks prior internal friction to make the shift earned. Embodied emotion is present but leans poetic over visceral at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation (to rescue the brother) is clear and embodied through memory and vow. The eel herder's precognitive curse is described but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene—she accepts her fate with "resigned grace" rather than struggling. The brother's displacement is told rather than shown through his experience. Interior voice remains consistent, though the elevated register occasionally distances us from raw emotion under peak pressure.

    The poet's motivation is stated but never tested through a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract, label-heavy phrasing ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy fear into clarity") rather than embodied contradiction. The caretaker functions as exposition conduit rather than pressure source; their dialogue delivers backstory without forcing the poet to forfeit or risk anything. The final tracing gesture and declarative statement "This is why I write" read as summary rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist shows a distinct perceptual signature filtered through the "dueling philosopher" lens, and micro-choices during the fencing sequence are embodied rather than merely declared. However, interiority occasionally tilts toward abstraction ("turn questions into destinations," "waiting was the most muscular verb") that reads more like thematic declaration than character-particular thought under pressure. The mechanical arm functions credibly in the duel but its emotional weight or trade-off is not foregrounded when stakes peak, limiting the cost visibility at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is highly specific and embodied ("my pockets chime with copper syllables"), though the monthly molting trait remains label-only without constraining a single on-page choice. Lio is present but functions more as co-conspirator than pressure source; no status dynamic or genuine conflict emerges between them. The final moment ("let us practice until dawn") lacks visible cost—the narrator's personality shift is declared but never dramatized as foreclosing a path. Embodied contradiction appears ("I press my palm to my chest to keep the fragments friendly") but the renunciation or change lacks causal grounding in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pianist's interiority is vivid and particular—"a chord he had forgotten to resolve," the wound-clock gesture—and his micro-choices (threading the reel, tuning steps to compasses, playing against the schedule) show embodied decision-making under pressure. However, the motivation remains largely abstract: "surprise fate" and "derail the script" are poetic labels not grounded in a specific loss or relationship that would give the rebellion concrete weight. The broken anniversary clock hints at backstory but never anchors in a dramatized memory or micro-choice that tilts present stance, leaving the emotional stakes diffuse. The final smile reads as satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's role as "fantasy island reality checker" generates consistent choices—recording dreams, testing them against pelicans, following the count down the ridge—though the internal contradiction between empiricism and whimsy is asserted more than it creates visible friction. The partnership with Iru adds pressure without muddying spatial choreography. Embodied emotion appears in "my doubt glowed like a lighthouse" and "steadier hearts," but some beats lean on abstraction ("careful courage") rather than physical sensation. The seed-planting choice feels earned by the dream logic established early, foreclosing the path of endless searching.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bonsai tutor's interior voice is distinct and embodied—"obedience is the way fear pretends to be careful"—and the movement from swallowed words to spoken apology is earned through accumulating imagery. The emotional arc from discipline-as-cage to listening-to-branches shows contradictory impulses in action. Minor slips: the gull "measuring the hush like a colleague" feels slightly precious, and the final teaching vow ("I would speak slowly…") edges toward summary rather than lived tension. Still, the renunciation of storm-pruning and the choice to "let the sea's blue instruction diffuse" forecloses the old method with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s worldview and habits (“preprocesses reality”) are embodied in how she approaches the flood damage, and her modest recalibration toward gentler attention feels earned. The occupational specificity (neutron star researcher) meaningfully shapes both perception and action. Internal conflict between former love of “flamboyant fireworks” and new humility is present but very understated, so the emotional cost of this shift remains somewhat muted. A touch more friction or vulnerability on the page under pressure could deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motives—justice, survival, and a crafted relationship to truth—are clear and consistently refracted through their craft (“neither cold nor hot, but annealed”). Interiority is specific and embodied via glass, heat, and sand rather than abstract labels, and the final choice grows credibly from prior traits (steadily adaptive, listening to materials). There is a genuine tension between self-protection, vengeance, and a slower, riskier exposure that the ending partially resolves without over-tidying. A slightly greater sense of irrational fear or anger under peak stress could deepen the conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to refuse drowning in the post-hush quiet by translating silence into another sensory music—is vivid, consistent, and drives every choice. Interiority is embodied and specific (“comparing frost to pulse,” “accepting gratitude like small embers to pocket”), and the ferry/choir backstory cleanly deepens present stakes. There’s not a sharp internal contradiction so much as a steady, resolute endurance, but for this length it reads earned rather than static. The final stance—continuing the practice with “permission to continue”—feels motivated by all that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The undertaker’s weariness, professional competence, and quiet, obstinate compassion are all clearly dramatized, and his motivation to “give rest a permanent address” coherently drives every choice. Interiority is specific and embodied through perceptions (“names feel waterlogged,” “I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid”) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction exists—fatigue and fear versus inadvertent stubbornness—but remains relatively subtle and archetypal rather than deeply particularized. The final stance, accepting ongoing work in the library’s service, feels earned and costs him an easier, more detached life.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is sharply drawn—“gently persistent, a tide that returned”—and her choices (instituting the bell, facing the patrol, pairing teens with elders) are coherent and motivated. The communal “we” POV gives the village personality, though the individual “I” narrator is less developed and mostly functions as chronicler. Emotional stakes are embodied in small, specific gestures (holding the bell without ringing, writing constellations instead of names). Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation—to locate and release “unused love” rooted in a past-life miserliness with light—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice on the page. Interiority is rich and embodied through breath, the camera, and the bodily act of tasting the vial’s water. The internal contradiction (reverence for light vs. fear of letting it touch others) is dramatized through the mirror-maker memory and resolved via the exhale practice, with a visible cost in relinquishing hoarded safety. The small interaction with the man on the bridge nicely externalizes her shift without feeling tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s blend of professional identity (hedge maze designer) and private wound (the burned library) yields a specific, coherent motivation: to rework grief and time into navigable structure. His conflict between wanting to give grief “exits” and recognizing that “exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps” gives him a credible inner contradiction. Emotional states are rendered mostly through externalized, idiosyncratic imagery rather than conventional feeling labels, which fits the mode. The relationship with the lichen woman is more symbolic crucible than psychologically developed, but it does exert real pressure on his stance toward memory and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is vivid, consistent, and particular—“chained liberator” bound to the land by vow rather than law—and every choice (staying for the keys, prioritizing seeds over safety or the arrow) flows cleanly from that. Interiority is mostly externalized through image and action rather than explicit thought, but the hierarchy of values is very clear. What’s slightly missing at elite level is a sharper on-page contradiction or moment of genuine inner doubt; she never seems truly torn. The final endurance—walking on still chained, pockets full of keys and seed dust—reads as earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motive—finding “the sound of trust breaking” after a partner’s betrayal—is specific, consistent, and sharpened by the technical devotion to tone and devices. Interiority is richly particular (“betrayal a glass harmonica threatening to shatter”) and their professional obsession is clearly entwined with emotional damage. The final shift from hunting rupture to imprinting pre-fracture trust reads as an earned reorientation, not a neat epiphany. The only thing holding this back from the absolute top is that contradictory impulses under peak pressure (wanting to hear the fracture vs. fearing it) stay more implied than directly dramatized in a single, pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethic (“steal only what the day is already losing”), and conflicted desire to test “destiny’s door” all read specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (cracking the jar, decoding the bouquet, breaking the lock) follow clean, character-rooted logic. The mentor relationship is sketched efficiently yet lands with weight in “tender, ruinous gratitude” and his plea to “reinterpret the debt.” Internal contradiction—thief vs. giver—is present but could surface a bit more as live tension in the mid-scene rather than as a mostly retrospective insight. Still, the final stance shift from taking to returning feels earned and costs her a prior self-concept, which is impressive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Arlen’s interiority is specific and credible, with his ritualized narration and attitude toward “safeness” giving him a distinctive psychology. His motive—to create safe zones for inquiry—is clear and consistently embodied in choices (building the kiln, arranging vessels, planning the gathering). The internal shift—abandoning the fear that “science and tenderness could not share a bench”—is earned by prior behavior and comes with a visible cost in effort and responsibility. The only limitation is that his contradictions remain relatively gentle; there’s little sharp internal clash beyond fear vs care.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory—terror and determination coexist (“Fear could be a lever, not a lock”), and their actions flow consistently from this. The brother’s motives are sketched with enough ambiguity to feel human rather than exculpatory, and the child’s presence sharpens who the brother has become. The final stance—choosing honesty and connection while still trembling—feels earned by the prior beats. A slight drawback is that “firmly adaptive” is stated once more as a label than dramatized as a complex flaw with visible downside.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The oracle and the courier are cleanly differentiated in voice, posture toward the world, and core wants, and their motivations (her compulsion to map silence; his fear and half-buried disobedience) track consistently through the scene. His confession about coming to burn the records and his pivot to carrying the booklet feel motivated by what they’ve just shared, not imposed. Internal contradiction exists—he’s both scoffing and longing for absolution; she is both devout to her method and aware of its fragility—but it’s sketched more through lyric assertion than deeply dramatized interior conflict. The ending’s endurance choice (she stays in danger, he breaks with orders) lands with credible, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The robot’s motivation—to understand where thoughts come from while doing its cleaning work—is clear, consistent, and embedded in small, particular choices (putting broom aside, experimenting with the bow). Interiority is specific and character-particular; the link between “hesitation leaves streaks” and its philosophical curiosity is strong. Internal conflict is present but fairly gentle—the piece rarely puts the janitor’s curiosity and its mandate in sharp, simultaneous opposition, so cost feels modest. The endurance at the end (“That is my job, and my faith…”) reads as an Earned Stasis, but the renunciation price remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The registrar’s motives and contradictions are clear and compelling: his self-professed cowardice versus his professional identity as “reader of light” culminate in a well-earned decision to confess publicly. His micro-choices—hoarding the lens, choosing to read the tickets, then deciding to stage a screening—track believably. Embodied emotion comes through in specific beats (“my heartbeat is a drum in my wrists”), not just labels. The only slight weakness is the occasional abstract self-summation (“learning to be freed by honesty”) that edges toward telling rather than fully dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The vine dresser’s stubborn pragmatism, superstition, and moral scruple are all dramatized through concrete micro-choices (rituals, the planted marble, the confession to the fountain). His internal contradiction—between manipulative “necessary kindness” and a need for honest reciprocity—comes to a head when the maze “objects.” The final earned stasis (“I left the gate unlatched”) credibly forecloses his prior posture as “luck’s apprentice” at a felt cost. This is nuanced, specific characterization with no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jae’s competence, quiet stubbornness about sideways time, and obliging nature are consistently rendered and drive his choices, especially pulling the lever against warnings and later choosing a gentler, “affection not test” stance toward proof. Interiority is largely implied through perception and action rather than spelled out, which works but keeps his internal contradiction (rescuer vs. theorist) relatively understated. The emotional cost of risking the station and himself for a speculative theory is present but could be sharpened on the page. His small, private recognition that “the returns included him” is a lovely, earned grace note that hints at deeper contradiction but doesn’t fully explore it.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivations are clear and consistent—curiosity and a quasi-religious obligation to the ghost’s code—and their choices (following the stains, entering the seam-room, accepting the baton) are all rooted in that drive. Interiority is vivid and specific, with fear and awe braided rather than toggled. The main limitation is that internal contradiction never quite sharpens into a true dilemma; the choice to risk “drowning again” feels eerie but not deeply contested. Still, the final acceptance of the conductor role reads as an earned, character-driven shift in responsibility and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured, embodied, and specific—“a small stone star” and “houses where voices were weather” render the narrator’s guilt and history vividly, and the lie’s cost feels lived-in rather than abstract. Contradictory impulses (protecting the loved one vs. self-erasure, wanting absolution vs. clinging to the lie) are dramatized in concrete micro-choices like smudging and then trying to “unwrite” the gentian. The oracle is distinct, not a stock seer: her “fault-tolerant” ethic, soot-mark ritual, and balance test all reveal a coherent character logic. If anything, her poise borders on too consistently wise and unruffled, softening potential friction or status clash between them.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s motivation—to test the “weight” of his father’s death and the rumor of the valve—is clear, specific, and consistently drives every choice. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“my breath tasted of iron,” “the cold make my palms intelligent”), with skepticism, grief, and stubborn practicality in credible tension. His final act—turning the wheel back open and choosing to carry the weight as tool rather than proof—feels fully earned and forecloses the fantasy of supernatural or corporate absolution. The only very slight limit is that no on-page relationship is actively pressuring him in the moment, so the relational crucible is mediated rather than direct.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The chronicle keeper’s sensibility and oath are sharply drawn and consistent, and micro-choices like accepting the mushroom-rewritten alphabet instead of resisting reveal character through action. The internal conflict—urge to judge versus sworn nonjudgment—remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses in a single pressured moment. Emotional texture is conveyed through tactile images (gripping reality like wet paper, seasoning tea with mortar dust), which keeps the interiority concrete and particular. The endurance choice at the end (loosening judgment, gripping only the pen) is earned but lands as a quiet reaffirmation rather than a fraught renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s mellow, attentive temperament and Ada’s scoured, careful grief are sharply drawn through specific actions (matching Ada’s tapping, asking to hold the locket, her tracing the question-mark curl). Motivation is clear and consistent: he wants to midwife wonder; she wants to keep her son’s memory intact without being destroyed by it. The shift at the end—Ada’s steadier breath and request for the lullaby in a lower key—feels modest but earned, with the cost of exposing her grief to the group. Internal contradiction is quieter than it could be, but the restraint suits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian’s motivation—to collect the stories walls have heard and to volunteer as a vessel once dreams are gone—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. His interiority is rendered through perceptual habits (“listener to brick tone and the breath of paper”), and his porosity (“not lonely so much as porous”) feels particular rather than generic. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal—he’s remarkably unwavering—which slightly limits emotional complexity. Still, his final stance (teaching walls to speak to each other, stitching the dragon into his logbook) reads as an earned deepening of the same drive, with a conceptual cost in self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “transpose life into a new key” and to arrange the town’s awareness rather than simply spy—is clear, consistent, and revealed through concrete choices (keeping the specs, taking them to the lighthouse, choosing “You already know”). Interiority is specific and character-particular, with a nice tension between self-mockery (“accidentally prophetic”) and quiet ambition. The relationship with the keeper is sketched efficiently yet feels lived-in, with legible status parity and mutual complicity. Internal conflict is present but could be pushed slightly harder on the page—the cost of meddling remains more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Father Ilario’s vocation, methods, and ethos are sharply etched, and Mara’s condition and history emerge through the ritual in a way that feels specific rather than generic possession. The grief-contract backstory (“a loan that promised warmth…”) gives her predicament moral and emotional texture, though we never fully inhabit her interiority. The husband is thinly drawn but functional as a foil who embodies mundane denial. Mara’s final choice to reclaim her name is clearly motivated by the accumulated inquiry and feels earned, with the cost of losing the “useful” whisper implicit rather than spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, particular, and embodied; lines like “chronologically homesick, stranded between tenses” feel deeply character-specific rather than generic. Motivation is clear and consistent—this is someone trying to translate a lifetime of oblique communication into a true “first movement.” The change at the end (re-seeing the fortunes as “instructions for breath”) is earned by earlier beats of failure and rehearsal, but the visible cost of that shift is subtle, mostly implied exhaustion and lifelong isolation rather than a sharply dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “retrace what I kept losing” and conquer the “labyrinth of self”—is clear and consistently embodied in how they use gravity-defiance and the tablet. Internal contradiction between the urge to rise and the decision to surrender flight is well dramatized, especially in “I had always thought conquest meant height… So I lowered, a grain at a time.” Emotional texture is character-particular rather than generic, with concrete perceptual bias (rain, wires, stone). The final renunciation of flight reads motivated and paid for, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation (terror of numbness and commitment to her students) is vivid and specific, and her deafness is integrated as a tactile, embodied mode of perception rather than a label. The realization that she herself has gone numb (“she had already stopped without noticing”) lands as a credible, earned turn. The relationship with Oko is economical but distinct, with status tilting toward him as teacher in this space. The piece could push further into real resistance or contradictory impulses in the climax; things unfold a bit too smoothly once the experiment begins.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a believable tension between “credibly curious” inquiry and a desire for quiet integrity. Micro-choices—placing decoy charts, encoding a second message, stepping “not back or forward, but sideways”—all emerge from established traits. The emotional register is embodied through weather metaphors rather than labels, keeping it character-particular. The Earned Stasis at the end (choosing private witness over open confrontation) feels fully motivated and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivations (curiosity about scent-triggered grief, professional duty, fear of his mother’s perfume) are clear and cohere through the scene, and his arc from avoidance to newly calibrated acceptance is earned. Interiority is specific and embodied—“buckles me to the floor,” “drought on the lungs”—rather than generic. The dynamic with Marla is quiet but effective, with her applying gentle, profession-based pressure that shapes his choices. I held back from a 9+ because his internal contradiction (avoidance vs hunger) could be dramatized in one more concrete moment of near-refusal before he opens the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistently grounded in concrete images (the rope, the mile markers, the prison of clocks). Motivation is clear—“discover the texture of time” without harming anything—and actions track that motive through micro-choices (following the markers, asking to see how time bruises, pressing the rope to the mirror). His flaws and self-deceptions are acknowledged on the page (“knots I tied to seem heroic”), and the final stance of braiding past into present feels earned. The only limitation is that internal conflict rarely spikes into real resistance; he accepts each revelation slightly too smoothly for peak-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s voice and worldview are vivid and coherent, and her motivation—to unbind the hush and curate the unfinished—is clear and consistently dramatized. Interiority is rich and particular (“trained by breakwater murmurs”), and her choices (returning, playing, redefining the bowl as a map) feel organically driven. Lark is sketched effectively in a few strokes, serving as a foil that draws out the narrator’s philosophy. The only ceiling is that internal contradiction stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as sharp, in-scene ambivalence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Both the narrator and Rhea are sharply individuated, with motives that are specific (ethical use of “counterfeit” emotions; fusing data and care) and consistently dramatized in choices like warning her about the counterfeit and undercharging her. The internal tension—using fakes as bridges toward real feeling—is alive in how the narrator both loves their clients and maintains distance. Rhea’s arc from fence-thinking to “a map becoming pulse” is earned and rooted in the earlier herd anecdote. The only small limitation is that the narrator’s own deeper vulnerability is hinted at rather than truly tested, keeping this just short of fully piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara and Jun are sharply etched with distinct motives—Mara’s “cautious exuberance” and Jun’s whimsical attentiveness drive concrete choices (founding the Ledger, digging through manifests, curating displays). The relationship’s status shift is cleanly dramatized when Mara hands Jun the ledger key, sharing power and risk. Internal conflict is present but mostly gestured at rather than fully dramatized; Mara’s fear of recognition rarely meets real resistance on the page. A bit more friction or visible doubt at the public event could deepen the arc from private urge to public commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to graft themself onto a community through making—is clear, consistent, and refracted through specific choices (answering Farrin’s chalk, adopting the posture, dedicating their practice). “Boldly sympathetic” is shown in behavior rather than left as label, and their ache at the end feels earned rather than neatly resolved. What keeps this just below the very top tier is that internal contradiction under pressure (e.g., competing impulses to withdraw vs. lean in) remains more implied than dramatized in live micro-choices. The relationship with Farrin is vivid but largely harmonious, so we don’t see a relationship-based crucible that really forces a difficult, character-revealing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation (to locate the birthplace of echoes and capture it in observation and ink) is vivid and consistent, and their identity as a patient, meticulous illustrator permeates perception and choices. Internal tension between curiosity, ethical concern for the echo larvae, and awareness of time-debt (“It needed to be uncaged”) gives the central decision real weight. The final micro-choices—releasing one larva, repaying time, yet lingering to finish the sketch—read as an earned, character-specific endurance. Emotional texture is intentionally cool and cerebral, which fits the voice but keeps us a half-step removed from deeper vulnerability that might push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conjurer’s motivation—seeking “coherence” rather than reunion after his sister’s ambiguous loss—is specific and convincingly rooted in remembered detail (fractions with buttons, the cat stealing a numerator). His internal conflict between misdirection as self-protection and this new, riskier “gentler mathematics” is dramatized through the ritual with the eyes, rope, and stone. The final choice to leave the eyes and carry the rope as memento/intention feels like an earned stance crystallization rather than a neat cure. A slight abstraction in emotional language (“mathematics of emotion,” “ambiguous loss”) keeps this just shy of fully embodied peak-level characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crawl-space dweller is sharply particular—his “pads of felt on knees,” dustlavender pouch, and chalk routes all embody a kindly, meticulous temperament under pressure. His core conflict (wanting visibility vs fearing exposure) is dramatized in the decision to help the girl while remaining unseen. The ending’s earned stasis—choosing service over stepping into her gaze—feels motivated by everything we’ve seen. The girl is lightly sketched but vivid enough for her need to matter.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal contradiction between lifelong control (“years of arranging”) and her emerging practice of listening is clear, specific, and dramatized through micro-choices (tying knots, then stepping aside; keeping a ledger of what she hasn’t forced). Her emotional life is embodied in plant-focused perceptions rather than labels, and the shift to “care as subtraction” feels earned instead of epiphanic. The cost—relinquishing professional certainty and identity as an arranger—is legible but quiet. A slightly sharper on-page consequence or slip when she experiments with letting go could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Both narrator and keeper feel specific and lived-in, with clear motives (meaning-seeking, caretaking, grief) that drive concrete choices, especially around the brooch and the pact. The keeper’s quiet devastation and wordless weeping on seeing his mother is embodied and earned. The narrator’s insomnia, distrust of water, and compulsion to paint are present throughout, but moment-to-moment internal contradiction under pressure (e.g., more ambivalence about the gnat’s release) could be sharpened. The relationship changes credibly into a working partnership, though the acceptance of the supernatural exchange feels emotionally smooth rather than fully contested.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator-guide and the baker pilgrim are both sharply sketched with specific, character-rooted details (clairvoyant who “did not see it coming,” baker craving “yeast that rises like laughter”). Motivation is clear: she’s hired to guide and guarantee safety; he seeks how the pearl might change his village. The internal conflict—her authority vs. being bypassed by the pearl—is strong but more conceptual than bodily felt, so the cost of losing that role could be more viscerally dramatized. Still, the micro-choice where she reaches to stop the pearl and is “emptied of certainty” lands convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archivist’s sensibility and ethic (“reactively visionary,” compiling “fragments into meaning”) are specific and consistent, and his choices—to collaborate with the woman, to privilege structure over tone, to give the valve back—feel motivated and quietly costly. The raincoat woman is sketched in a few precise moves (giving weather instead of a name, “she used to march,” walking without leaving anywhere) that make her more than a device. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: the archivist wants to record absences yet is drawn into shaping a collective return. A slightly deeper dramatization of his ambivalence under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s mix of control (maps, lines, measurements) and yearning for the “spaces between lines” yields a clear, specific psychology, and their final choice to “unbutton” patterns and step through reads earned. Motivation to reach the fortress of unspoken truths is steady and legible throughout. The internal conflict—safety in pattern vs. risk of listening—is present but often encoded in imagery rather than concretely embodied reactions, which keeps it one notch shy of fully visceral. Still, micro-choices (following the arrows, boarding the train, offering then reclaiming the punch) show a coherent value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s blend of skepticism and caretaking is specific and consistent, and Lio’s simple, focused desire makes him feel real despite limited page time. Micro-choices like offering tea instead of false comfort, and later choosing to name their own losses, clearly reveal values under pressure. Internal conflict (reason vs. mercy; professionalism vs. vulnerability) is present but stays relatively smooth and articulate, with little true loss of composure. Lio’s emotional complexity is somewhat underdeveloped, reading more as a pure vessel for grief than a fully knotty child.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The immortal narrator’s boredom, refusal of endings, and collecting of “echoes” form a coherent, specific psychology, and the drive to learn what comes after goodbye is clear and consistent. Lio’s hurt and stubborn refusal to forgive add a credible relational counterpressure. Emotional life is vivid but more conceptual than bodily; we don’t get much concrete, contradictory embodiment of feeling under peak stress. The closing shift toward “purpose” feels earned, if a bit thematically tidy rather than painfully conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives—honest work versus the family’s con-artist legacy—are sharply articulated and drive every choice, from aiding Arman to insisting on truthful paperwork. Interiority is specific and embodied (“air that tastes like coins,” the squeeze on the wrist), and the father’s shadow provides credible internal conflict without melodrama. The final stance—taking evidence instead of bribe—reads as an earned evolution of her ethics, not a sudden revelation. Arman is thinly drawn but functions credibly as a scared, disciplined co-agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethics, and habits give a strong, particular interiority, and his motive—to give the town a “workable grammar for waiting”—is both clear and distinctive. His micro-choices (staying behind, charting the hum, inventing histories, delivering them) consistently arise from that sensibility. Internal contradiction is subtler: there’s a tension between fidelity to silence and deliberate fabrication, but it stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied in a sharp on-page moment of doubt. The final endurance on the mountaintop feels like earned stasis, though its emotional cost is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to recover the “texture of memories” and interrogate his own bureaucratic erasure—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice from eavesdropping to confronting the widow. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“my fingertips taste bitter, the way lies do”) and we see a credible contradiction between wanting truth and wanting the softer ambiguity of texture. The final refusal to reclaim a name and instead resume walking/ listening reads as an Earned Stasis with a clear cost. The widow and mechanic are economically but effectively characterized as pressures rather than types.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The myth buster is sharply sketched—“gloomy cheerfulness like a raincoat” and his trust in ribs over logic give him specificity and coherence. His motivation (decode the riddle / retell the sky) is clear and consistent with his past as a mapmaker of sighs. There is some internal contradiction (skeptical myth buster who loves myths) but it stays mostly implied rather than dramatized through hard choices. The final endurance—accepting the answer about kindness and walking away with “cheerful gloom intact”—reads as an earned, quiet stasis rather than a transformative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Nessa’s interiority and role are vivid and specific—“culture shock absorber” with dual allegiance is a sharp, lived tension, and her choices (the pact, the raft realignment) are clearly motivated. The family triangle with mother/brother plus the liaison gives her relationships real pressure. The main weakness is a slight over-abstractness of feeling at key beats; we get more conceptual framing than embodied stress when she risks the city by using the ballast console. Still, the final ceasefire with her brother feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives (documenting the last moth, honoring the Nightwatch legacy, securing funding) are clear, specific, and consistently drive each micro-choice. Interiority is richly embodied in images like “a picture sometimes outlasts its subject,” which feels character-particular rather than generic. Internal conflict—between scientific duty, filial grief, and awe—is present but mostly harmonized rather than sharply contradictory, keeping this just short of the very top band. The final endurance stance (witnessing without intervening) feels earned and carries a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artisan is vividly particular—her tactile reading of bowls and quiet authority over Mirel establish competence and care as core traits. Motivation is clear (guide the coupling safely) and her micro-choices under pressure (calling for more bowls, live-patching the code) track cleanly. What’s thinner is explicit internal conflict: she rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses, so the emotional cost of her composure stays mostly implied. The relationship with Mirel is warm but lightly sketched as collaboration rather than a crucible that transforms them.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s mix of dry wit, self-professed lack of bravery, and “subtle confidence” is specific and consistently dramatized through their methods (condensation-reading, careful ritual with the valves). Motivation—to find where the rivers truly begin—is clear and guides every choice. The internal conflict between mapping and preserving wildness (“afraid it would tame what should remain wild”) is strong but remains mostly conceptual rather than driving a sharp, high-cost choice. The final stance—trusting listening before naming—feels earned, but the cost of that stance could be made slightly more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bell tuner’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific—his “infinitely patient” drive to restore balance feels organic—and his methods reveal character more than any exposition. The mother and children are efficiently sketched with credible wariness, curiosity, and tentative trust. Internal contradiction (urgency vs. patience) is present but mostly told rather than dramatized in on-page struggle, so peak choices don’t feel truly pressured. The final communal agreement is moving but comes a bit easily, with limited sense of emotional or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation (save the crew) is clear and steadily intensified by the air/time constraint, with the vial adding a distinct personal quirk (“to harness the ephemeral and bend it toward rescue”). Interiority is specific and embodied—panic “paddles my ribs,” stillness is a “single held note”—and contradictory impulses (instinct to thrash vs. chosen stillness) play out in-scene. The repeated choice to override instinct under pressure feels like an earned, character-specific skill rather than a generic trait. The only minor limitation is that relationships (crew, sister) stay largely off-page, so their emotional texture is more evoked than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—escaping his father’s legacy of false alarms by “chasing hush”—is specific, consistent, and threads cleanly into the final poised decision about how to speak to the investigators. Internal contradiction (need to confess vs. need to control the story) is present and credible, though it operates more as stated tension than dramatized push-pull in on-page behavior. The brief interaction with the woman in the cell efficiently reflects his inner conflict but doesn’t quite become a crucible relationship. The final stance—answering in “segments that made a beam,” not lying yet still shaping—is well earned from prior setup and carries a visible cost to his inherited identity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ghost bride is sharply etched—wry, dutiful, tenderly punitive—while the keeper’s “farmer heart” and quiet devotion to work give him a believable, understated core. His motivation to wake the orchard and honor her conditions is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction (duty to trees vs latent attachment to her; gratitude vs the risk of using the key selfishly) is present but under-dramatized, leaving his inner life slightly thinner than the world and premise deserve. The final endurance—keeping the vow after losing her—lands, but an extra beat of conflicted interiority under pressure could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sera’s motivation is vivid and consistent—“hauntingly optimistic” and stubborn enough to carry the forbidden plate into the labyrinth—and her wharf-weaver craft is organically tied to her problem-solving. Interiority is concrete and particular, filtered through rope, salt, and ritual rather than generic emotion labels. Internal contradiction (fear vs optimism, reverence vs defiance of precedent) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in sharp on-page clashes. The final endurance—leaving the plate, bringing back the tether—feels earned and forecloses the easier path of solitary heroism in favor of shared ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s diasporic dislocation, professional role, and spiritual hunger are all cleanly dramatized, and her decision to stay and tend the orchard feels like a credible evolution rather than a flip. Her interiority is particular and embodied (“a hinge give way in my chest”), and choices—rebuilding the sundial, re-shelving objects—flow from consistent impulses. The relationship with Sami is lightly but effectively sketched as a collaborative crucible, shading her choices rather than merely echoing them. The only small limit is that under acute emotional beats, contradictory impulses are more implied than actively struggling on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s vocation, habits, and fears are specific and coherent, and their micro-choices (using chalk codes, rejecting digital speed, testing names “like dentists test nerves”) feel deeply character-driven. Internal conflict is quiet but real: duty to the client, protectiveness toward the addressee, and a belated recognition of their own history in the chalk. The closing hesitation at the mail slot registers as an earned, character-specific form of patience rather than generic lyric stalling. The only limitation is that the emotional cost of this work on the narrator could be shaded a touch more explicitly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The embroiderer’s motives—listening as craft, complicity in truth-telling, and comfort with being “the fool” who’ll be blamed—are clear and consistently dramatized through her choices to keep stitching, loosen threads, and carry the satchel away. Interiority is textured and particular (“I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past when dressed like a jester”) rather than generic. However, her internal conflict (curiosity vs. fear, ethics vs. complicity) stays mostly implied; we don’t see sharply opposed impulses collide in a single pressured moment. The keeper’s characterization is effectively sketched but remains largely a foil rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to revisit and understand the “moment before deciding” with Mara—is clear, specific, and drives every beat. Interiority is rich and embodied (the shard’s wound, breath, ribs cracking) and the blind spot (protecting fear instead of the relationship) feels credibly shameful rather than tidily confessed. The final stance—“I will go home and not decide, not yet; I will share the hinge and let it breathe us.”—is an earned renunciation that forecloses the old reflex to flee. The only small limit is that Mara’s on-page pressure is entirely reflective, so the crucible of their dynamic is powerful but one-sided here.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator is sharply etched—profession, temperament, and ethics all read through specific choices (how they frame the boy’s drawings, how they mediate between mother and uncle). The boy’s “shrewdly innocent” quality comes through his drawings and reactions rather than labels. Internal conflict is present but understated: the piece hints at the emotional cost of “carrying something back” without fully dramatizing doubt or failure-risk. Secondary characters are sketched via behavior under pressure, with the mother/uncle relationship shifting credibly in a few strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mural artist’s motivation—to “rediscover lost joy”—is clear and consistently embodied in how she works with light, the shard, and the community. Interiority is vivid, specific, and idiosyncratic (“pensive mirth…the smile that sits cross-legged on a question”), giving her a distinct sensibility. However, her internal conflict remains relatively gentle; we don’t see truly contradictory impulses or a sharp cost to her choices, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The restorer’s motives—commissioned “faithful restoration” vs. her desire to “exchange certainty for curiosity”—are clear and consistently dramatized through on-page choices. Interiority is vivid and particular, with the hobo nickel, the grandfather, and the mason’s daughter all refracting how she sees her task. The internal conflict peaks effectively when she admits fear that “a perfect restoration erases the hands that kept living,” a turn that feels earned by the prior beats. Emotional contradiction could be sharpened slightly under peak pressure, but the arc is fully credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation (protecting “sparks of defiance”) is clear and consistently embodied in their habits—maps, footnotes, gardening tactics—rather than abstract labels. However, interior conflict is relatively light; we rarely feel them pulled between competing desires or costs, so they read as ideologically steady more than psychologically complex. Dr. Kline is sketched vividly but remains mostly supportive pressure, not a crucible that forces a hard relational choice. The final stance feels earned, but the personal cost or inner contradiction at that moment is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The insomniac poet’s desire “to photosynthesize pain into beauty” is specific and consistent, and her hesitations (trying to bury doubts, fearing sleep) plausibly complicate that goal. Her consent to the treaty and later role as caretaker read like an earned reconfiguration rather than an easy cure. The Gardener is more emblematic than fully human but still exerts credible relational pressure. Emotional states are embodied in setting and image rather than labels, keeping her individual rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    The caretaker’s motivation—to preserve forgotten names and atone for a past failure—is clear, specific, and drives every choice. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (“my heartbeat falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice”), with genuine contradiction between her gently systematic professionalism and her fear of failing again. The vow after the rain-dial mistake nicely backstops the urgency of saving the cracked chime. The final self-test with her own name feels like an earned, costly ritual rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s mix of guilt, professional obsession, and “carefully reckless” temperament drives every choice from persisting with the stele to devising the promise-suite. Lio is sketched efficiently but distinctly through fear of uncontrollable awakenings and his initial “terrible courtesy.” The relationship under pressure credibly shifts from stalemate to tentative collaboration as they revise the coda. A few emotional moves are phrased in high-level abstraction (“truth harms…bruises without accompaniment”) rather than embodied contradiction, which slightly distances us from peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The machinist’s motivations—professional duty, ethical fairness, and private susceptibility to “encrypted compassion”—are clear and consistently drive choices, especially in protecting the forbidden lovers while still correcting the system. Internal conflict between traders and ash-keepers is well seeded (“my own heart thrummed between them”) and resolved through the compromise catenary. Emotional life is embodied (trembling, sensory reactions) and not merely labeled. The only limit at this length is that her inner contradictions aren’t tested to true breaking-point; everyone accepts the compromise relatively smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives—preserving songs and guarding herself after artistic theft—are concrete, specific, and consistently drive choices. Internal conflict between suspicion and desire for connection is alive on the page, especially around sending the “fragile choir” to the violinist despite past betrayal. Embodiment is excellent (“my heart holds both, blooming and withering”), and professional identity (trainer of courier pigeons) informs perception and tactics. A slight tendency to state insights in thesis-like lines (“A courier pigeon trainer reinvents personal history…”) keeps this just shy of peak subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s desire to understand the father and “what thresholds demand” is specific, consistent, and drives every choice up to the refusal to descend. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“featherly determined,” distrust of “calm”) rather than generic. The final renunciation—loving him from a distance, not entering the maze—feels fully earned by the earlier teachings about necessary distances. The only small limit is that contradictory impulses (rush down vs. hold back) are more implied than dramatized in a moment of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s desire “to learn the rhythm of belonging without pretending to be native” is specific, credible, and carried cleanly through to the final realization about humming that rhythm back. Interiority is filtered through her unusual craft (landscape astrologer), which keeps emotions character-particular rather than generic. Internal conflict—outsider guilt vs. longing to stay—remains more implied than dramatized in in-scene contradictory impulses, which keeps this just shy of top tier. Rin functions well as a foil and partner but is more functionally competent than psychologically distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, temperament (“cheerful gloom”), and methods are sharply drawn and consistent, and their motivation to honor both paths and people feels grounded. However, internal contradiction is fairly low; they rarely waver or struggle, moving from problem to solution with calm competence. The shepherd appears only in vision, so relationships don’t add much crucible pressure. The closing stance—reverent acceptance of disappearance—is earned but comes at a gentle, largely conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s characterization is vivid and specific—an “analytical street performer” whose worldview is enacted through coins, chalk, and the bishop, not merely described. Motivation (to curate luck, to make interludes do “the truer work”) is consistent and emerges through micro-choices with the girl and the janitor. The janitor’s grief and the performer’s ethic around objects (“Objects are not souvenirs…”) create a credible, felt shift by the end. Internal contradiction (rational calculus vs. mystical luck) is present but could be pushed into sharper on-page tension to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation (protecting outlawed memory through embodied art) is clear and consistent, and their craft choices under pressure (leaving the city, choosing the cartographer’s shoulder, planning future deceptions) feel grounded in that drive. Interiority is particular and embodied through tidal and choreographic metaphors rather than generic emotion labels. The relationship with the cartographer has emotional charge but their interior life remains sketch-like, making the bond slightly more symbolic than fully dramatized. The closing tilt from exile to vocation is earned but could carry sharper on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glazier’s vocation, sensibility, and motives are vivid and specific, with concrete habits (polishing windows, consulting the pond) that feel lived-in and consistent. His desire to honor the harbor while engaging with development is clear, though internal contradiction under pressure remains more tonal than sharply dramatized. The boy’s brief presence nicely tests his values (“can a window hold a family”) but doesn’t deeply destabilize them. The closing stance—choosing the integrative design solution—is well motivated by prior reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Both protagonists are sharply particularized—his “bargained innocence” and translator’s guilt, her strict-tender composure—and their choices (keeping the box, insisting on opening it together, planning to teach children) grow cleanly from those traits. Interiority is embodied and specific (“made room around the fact the way rock makes room for water”), and they remain flawed without being absolved. The relationship functions as a crucible, shifting from distance to collaborative repair under pressure. The final stance—less debt, more pathway—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—to recalibrate hope for a sleepwalking village—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice in the grotto. Interiority is specific and character-particular (“logical dreamer,” reading possibility from an altitude gauge) rather than generic. Internal conflict is present but muted; there’s little genuine doubt or friction around the risks or limits of her project, which keeps this shy of a truly searing arc. The final stance shift—walking home “inside the serene upheaval we had called forth”—feels earned, but the cost of that shift remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation, vow, and sensitivity cohere into a vivid interior life, and their conflict between aestheticizing ruins and “mapping faithfully” gives them a real moral tension. Embodied responses—ear to lime, hopscotch to test echoes, feeling the shawl of legacy—keep emotion grounded. The final acceptance of the burden (“a shawl woven from echoes”) feels earned by what precedes. The only limitation is that internal contradiction under peak pressure could be made a shade sharper or riskier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to renegotiate their relationship with their own survival via “persuading mirrors”—is clear, specific, and consistently acted on. The borrowed heartbeat and its prior owner create a credible internal contradiction between caution and longing for grace (“as if it wanted to outgrow me”). The mirage painter is sparely but distinctly characterized through her stance and instructions, with status dynamics that feel earned. The shift at the end—accepting futures as possibilities rather than guarantees—reads motivated and carries a quiet cost, though the internal struggle could sharpen one more notch at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The negotiator’s professional ethic, fatigue, and values are sharply etched, especially in choices like letting the argument “ride the wind to exhaustion” before reframing redemption as shared work. Secondary figures (old soldier, opposing delegate, general, children) feel specific despite minimal page-time and exert real pressure on the negotiator’s stance. Internal contradiction is present but understated: the narrator is “operatively gentle” yet clearly hardened by history, carrying both idealism and weary pragmatism. A bit more embodied interior struggle in the peak beats could deepen the sense of cost-paid in the protagonist’s psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s contradiction—“amoral philanthropist” who engineers drought yet hoards echoes—is vivid, specific, and consistently dramatized through choices like trading an egg for a hospital wing. His motivation (preserve echoes vs. cause harm) is coherent and deepens as the ritual proceeds, with micro-choices (waiting for silence, placing speakers, whispering “Release”) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final slackening in his spine and denial of his own tears reads as an earned, costly shift rather than a neat epiphany. The only slight limit is that all pressure is internal/ritualistic, with no relational crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The courtesan’s motivation and discipline are clear and specific—chastity as chosen capacity, not denial—and her actions consistently serve that aim. Her risk (subverting palace speech under watchful guards) feels earned by prior set-up about her training and vow to “defy the lullaby of conformity.” What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper on-page contradiction or internal struggle under pressure; she never wavers, which flattens complexity. The final beat suggests a reconfigured stance with cost implied but not deeply felt from inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with the narrator’s ethical self-reckoning (“ethics I had not yet earned”) feeling grounded in past behavior rather than abstract guilt. The decision to reconfigure the troupe’s method and invite the woman in is clearly motivated and costs ego and control. Internal contradiction—wanting to do good while having exploited others—is present, though the final serenity comes a touch smoothly, with little residue of resistance in the last beats. The woman from the bar is sharply but briefly drawn, serving as a strong ethical counterweight despite limited on-page time.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories through non-magical, attentive ritual—remains clear and consistent, and micro-choices (using temporary signals instead of permanent records, staying silent, protecting the wing) align with that stance. Interiority is rich and particular (“esoteric realist,” suspicion of fantasies, awareness of authorities’ preference for straight lines). Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; contradictory impulses under pressure are muted, giving the piece a slightly too-composed emotional profile for top-tier characterization. Still, the final posture of lying in moss awaiting “history to answer” reads as an earned, if quiet, endurance/renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s guilt, vocation, and tenderness are sharply realized, with “technically gentle” and the mis-sent wedding bell giving concrete facets to their character. Motivation—preserving names and earning the right to return—is clear and consistent. Internal conflict is present but remains mostly tonal rather than dramatized as sharply competing impulses at a peak beat. The final sense of partial repair (“mended what I could”) feels earned but could land even harder with one more explicitly fraught micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation—to understand whether paths choose walkers and whether they are chosen—is clear, specific, and drives every choice from opening the seal to stepping through the door. Interiority is rich and particular rather than generic, with contradictions between duty to “decaying directives” and the desire to be invited rather than compelled. The final acceptance of the path as an invitation, not an order, feels earned by prior ambivalence. Emotional texture is mostly conveyed through image rather than labeled feeling, which works, though it keeps us a half-step removed from visceral fear or grief.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is sharply etched as frugal, skeptical, and devout in a sideways, “empirically ironic” way, with consistent micro-choices (saving lamp oil, using wires instead of grand instruments). His internal contradiction—mocking rites yet enacting a de facto ritual—feels organic and culminates in an earned vow. Emotional states are mostly conveyed via perception and metaphor rather than embodied sensation, which keeps him a touch abstract. Still, his motives and the cost of his pledge are clear and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rell and the narrator both feel distinct and motivated: Rell’s resentment is concretely embodied in his spine and tongue, and the narrator’s “scheming pacifist” ethos is dramatized through designed encounters rather than talk. The emotional turn in the factory sequence—gathering his mother’s unspent breath and letting “resentment loosen from his tongue like old thread”—feels earned by prior setup. Internal contradiction (his clung-to anger vs. desire for relief) is present, though more could be made of his resistance in-scene before he yields. Overall, the change is credible, particular, and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ilen’s interiority (“not a mystic…just a worker of surfaces”) and his craftsmanlike, embodied way of steadying Noor give him specific, credible motivation. Noor is slightly thinner on the inside but still individualized through the numbers-as-story and her history as the dream’s former host. Their micro-choices under pressure—choosing to recreate rather than chase, stabilizing the corridor through memory and breath—track cleanly with their motives. The main limit is that their conflicting impulses (fear vs responsibility, capture vs care) are more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives (money vs. the “quieter and sharper” reason) and his fear around the tin and the daughter are concrete and consistent, and his craft identity is deeply embedded in how he thinks and acts. His contradictory impulses—wanting repair but avoiding confrontation with his daughter—play through micro-choices like tying the ribbon and leaving the tin shut. Mira is a distinct, active presence whose feistiness both aids and needles him without turning schematic. The ending stance (continuing to mend, waiting rather than opening the tin) feels like an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The curator’s mixture of professional bewilderment, inherited curiosity, and fear is specific and consistent, and his aunt’s influence plus the cameo habit ground his motives. His choice to enter the forbidden grove, to “ask with his lineage,” and to eat the dull fruit all feel causally motivated by that blend of curiosity and loyalty. The internal shift—accepting that his role is to curate “the between” and that the orchard will claim him—is clear and earned. The emotional cost of potential self-rewriting is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation and worldview are vivid and particular, and their choices (refusing payment, bargaining to rescue the apprentice, pursuing the library despite its indifference) feel cleanly motivated by the established obsession with memory and “rescue missions.” Interiority is embedded in how they perceive language and absence, not via abstract label-speak, which keeps the character specific. Internal contradiction is quieter—there’s not a lot of in-scene struggle or fraying under pressure—so the emotional cost of continuing this work could be made more felt. Still, the final decision to turn the rescue lens onto themselves lands as a credible, earned extension of who we’ve seen throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interior conflict between “chimera twin discoverer” and “person” is vivid and specific, culminating in the line, “To go forward I had to decide whether to be a discoverer or a person.” Micro-choices—following the horses, taking the jar, speaking or not speaking names—track cleanly with that tension. Emotions are embodied via textures like the “net” of the bargain or the cold jar rather than labeled abstractly. If anything, the piece could bear one sharper, concrete shard of personal history to deepen the sense of what’s truly at risk beyond the conceptual self.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist is sharply etched through his methods, metaphors, and occupational mindset; his “warmly methodical” nature is dramatized in how he handles the rope, the seal, and even ridicule as a kind of footnote. Motivation (translate confusion into clarity) is consistent and drives all major choices. What’s missing, at a top-tier level, is more palpable internal contradiction or emotional cost—he rarely feels truly torn or endangered, so his endurance reads a bit too serene. The final calm feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s vocation, perceptual habits, and emotional life are distinct and embodied (“making my ribs clatter like thin cups,” “tasted less brine, more sleep”). Motivation is clear—preserving the caves’ maps and finding quiet—but internal contradiction under pressure stays muted; they rarely doubt or misstep. The relationship with the energy beings is evocative but largely harmonious once they “soften,” so we don’t see much relational friction. The final stance—that they’ll keep tending the bloom as storms come—is earned but carries limited visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The custodian’s motive—proving coincidences have meaning—is clear and consistently expressed, and the retrocognition plus work on the beacon give them a distinct, embodied vocation. The relationship with Lio is sketched efficiently, with status and intimacy shifting as they collaborate and share backstory. Internal conflict is relatively muted: there’s little on-page doubt about the beacon project or visible fear of failure, so the final sense of “purpose clicking into place” feels more like confirmation than a costly change. Still, the quiet endurance and commitment to a fragile, improbable project read as an earned stance rather than a generic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s internal conflict between being a “binder” and a “page” is specific, coherent, and deepened across the piece, culminating in the risk of offering the plum memory. Motivation—to find a self that is not just collective echo—is consistently dramatized rather than declared. The decisive act of speaking a personal memory carries credible cost and feels earned by prior doubt and hesitation. The only limiting factor is that the emotional progression stays mostly within one register of lyric introspection, with little behavioral friction beyond the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s vocation and worldview feel specific and embodied, and Lark’s presence gives a clear relational arc, but we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or a meaningful moral trade-off. Motivation—to “defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is consistent and enacted through choices, yet the protagonist never seems tempted to quit or doubt. Lark’s brief backstory as “the last fire spinner” is evocative but under-explored as a source of pressure. The final stance (walking the walls, “counting what remained possible”) feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a credible tug-of-war between sea-bound vocation and inland love (“I am a tidal-pool chronicler, and pauses are my native habitat”). Her choice to go inland is clearly motivated by accumulated images and micro-choices (weighing the cicada, listening to time) and carries a felt cost. The relationship dynamic is subtle but legible in the way she reads and slightly misreads the other’s silence, giving the bond texture beyond generic romance. If anything, the emotional pain of the decision could be shaded a touch more viscerally to push fully into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s claustrophobia, hunger for “flavors of different silences,” and ambivalence toward safety versus openness are specific, embodied, and drive every choice. The relationship with the father is economically rendered yet deep, culminating in a credible, costly change: inviting him to taste the hush and redraw his bunkers. Internal contradiction (“I am made of exits” yet seduced by a silence that erases doors) is dramatized rather than declared. The only small limit is that the father’s own interior complexity is hinted more than fully explored, though the length mostly justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gondola operator is vividly particular—his vocation, guilt over the singer, and almost priestly devotion to “comfort” feel specific and earned. His micro-choices (slowing the car, dimming the light, opening windows, tuning routes) arise naturally from that motivation. The mathematician is somewhat thinner but still distinct, with her “fluidly logical” speech, restless hands, and relationship to her equation making her more than an archetype. The emotional change at the end—her shoulders loosening, his reframing of the equation—is quiet but credibly motivated by what precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—the narrator is driven by duty, curiosity, and a deep attachment to institutional memory—and their refusal to claim the throne in favor of stewardship feels earned. The internal nuance is strong (“the old ache of libraries”), but genuine contradiction under pressure is muted; the decision comes rather smoothly given the scale of the stakes. Quin is sketched with vivid strokes but remains more function than fully pressured counterpart, so the relationship never quite becomes a crucible. Still, choices align with established traits and culminate in a credible, values-revealing renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation and ethic (“I am the one who burns bridges carefully…”) create a distinctive psyche whose choices drive the scene, and the refusal to let the girl vanish reads as a clear, motivated stance. Interiority is vivid and embodied through scars, breath, ash, and cold rather than labels. The girl is more archetype than individuated person, but her “girl and a crater” duality works symbolically and emotionally. The ending endurance—remaining as keeper while letting the student cross alone—feels like an earned renunciation of over-attachment, with a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich and specific—the IOU scars, the bolt, and the pyramid scheme history all feed a coherent, wounded-but-wry sensibility. Motivation to turn pressure into diamonds and not repeat past exploitation is clear and drives each micro-choice. The final acceptance of responsibility and the charity delivery read as earned evolutions of that flaw-set, not a neat epiphany. If anything, conflict between self-preservation and risk for others could be surfaced even more sharply in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s emotional arc—from shame and isolation to a burdened but purposeful acceptance—is sharply rendered through concrete choices (bringing the crank, activating the gramophone, vowing ovens over thrones). Interiority is specific and character-particular, with grief, duty, and relief coexisting in believable tension (“a door that had only awaited the right frequency to open”). The caretaker is deliberately minimal but still exerts subtle pressure through gesture and silence. If anything, the choice at the end feels slightly under-tested; we don’t quite see a live, tempting alternative path dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The knight’s motivation—to capture possibility and to renegotiate his identity after war—is clear, consistent, and sharpened by the revelation that the program belonged to his mother. Interiority is vivid and particular (“the world had asked for thunder, and he had given it until his bones echoed”), and his micro-choices—unsnapping visor and gorget, placing the program, climbing to the kernel—track a believable relinquishing of his old role. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. refusal of battle, loyalty to crown vs. orchard/mother) are present, if kept mostly in lyric rather than agonized form. The final ingestion of the kernel reads as an earned, costly change of allegiance rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist’s interiority is rich and particular, with a credible tension between “broken-hearted” and “tactfully hopeful” that drives her forensic tenderness toward dust and files. Her micro-choices—studying the dust, opening the box, revising the record, leaving the envelope—flow cleanly from that contradiction. Emotional states are embodied through the environment (“hospital of paper and sighs,” the hurt turning into meticulous attention) rather than abstract labels. Change at the end is quiet but earned: she accepts ongoing pain while committing more deeply to her practice, foreclosing the easier path of numb detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, rooted in the museum’s erasure of her mother and her own long habit of “folding risk into routine.” Her resourcefulness is dramatized in concrete choices—the buried key, the backpack with wire and bread, following the puddle-map—rather than just asserted. The main limitation is the near-absence of contradictory impulses or visible fear; the operation feels risky in concept but she rarely wavers on the page. The final stance as “the hinge, the turn” feels earned but comes without a sharply felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation and vocation are vivid and specific—the oath, the ritual, and the relationship to the vanished teacher all feel grounded and coherent. The narrator’s endurance in maintaining the hush reads as an Earned Stasis rather than a transformation, which is appropriate but limits emotional range. Moments like “eerie nostalgia is the music that rises when I lift the instrument” show particularized interiority. Internal contradiction (duty vs. longing, fear vs. aesthetic absorption) is present but kept mostly in subtext rather than dramatized cross-purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethics, and lineage (via the grandmother) are sharply drawn and specific, and her micro-choice to “prod myself” instead of the leaf is a lovely, character-revealing beat. Motivation—to read and properly arrange the leaves’ intentions—is consistent and clearly rooted in her sense of duty. The internal shift at the end (“what emerges transformed always is the hearer, never the leaf”) feels earned by the ritual we’ve watched. The main limitation is that conflict within her remains gentle rather than truly torn, so the cost of that shift is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tinkerer’s motives (from rigid precision toward befriending uncertainty) are clear and consistently dramatized through choices like following the compass and committing to the admiral’s ethos. Interiority is specific and filtered through craft and time imagery, not generic emotion labels. Internal conflict is present but more essayed than sharply dramatized in scene; contradictory impulses rarely collide in a single moment, which keeps this just shy of fully electric. The final stance change—choosing a “harbor” workshop over a cage—is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s characterization as a “balanced alchemist” is specific, embodied, and consistently tested through their rituals and guilt. Motivation—to redeem the mistake and test the mystical physics of names—is clear and drives every choice. Internal contradiction (rational measurer vs. believer in wonder, desire to undo vs. acceptance that she won’t return) runs through the piece and culminates in an earned stance of endurance at the end. The only minor limitation is that Mara remains more emblematic than individuated beyond a few vivid touches (“laughter rattled the furnace,” “golden soot”).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (“gardener of untended laughter,” “modestly fearless breath”), and his choices under pressure—how he engages the hesitant woman, how he ultimately stands aside—are consistent with his vocation and flaws. The woman’s fear of laughter is a clear, particularized internal conflict that’s addressed through action, not summary. The realization about the tooth as a compass toward mercy reconfigures his relationship to his own survival, giving him a modest but real shift in self-understanding. The only limit is that his contradictory impulses (duty vs. attachment) remain mostly implied rather than dramatized in direct, pressured hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and particular, with the enhanced proprioception and torture history creating a very specific moral psychology. The drive to formalize “the mathematics of mercy” grows credibly out of that history, and the bracing/strap choices feel like earned renunciations rather than tidy epiphanies. The internal contradiction between being an “instrument” of harm and wanting to be “wood again” runs through the piece and culminates in the vow not to exceed a limit. The only small limiter is that we glimpse only one relational vector (the unnamed “they” and distant interrogatees), so the character’s social stakes stay mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s vocation and hunger “paid in awakenings” are vivid and consistent, and their micro-choices (refusing to buy, insisting on the name, declining the drink) all track cleanly with the drive to honor overlooked histories. Interiority is specific and grounded in image rather than labels, and the moment where they “had learned how to keep still while moving” hints at a life’s contradiction distilled into craft. The painter is sketched efficiently as a foil—pragmatic, slightly cynical—whose shrug that “the story was only texture” gives the narrator something to push against. I’d push for one sharper flash of vulnerability or doubt in the narrator at the peak (e.g., fear of failing to recover the name) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific, grounded in his trades (elevators, dust, ceilings) and his moral stance toward the dead. Motivation is clear and particular—he “hunts ceilings because they keep the living honest”—and this drives each micro-choice. Internal conflict between duty and curiosity is explicitly and credibly acknowledged (“Cracks in the facade had spread inside me too…”), then tested by the decision to unwind the barrel. The ending stance—carrying the mainspring as “receipt”—feels earned and forecloses a path of neutrality without straining plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The operator’s motives—balancing the library’s wobble against a buried hunger for one perfect moment with their mother—are specific, consistent, and surface organically through work and memory. Contradictory impulses (preserve asymmetry vs. grant eternity a chance) are dramatized rather than summarized, and the ultimate choice to print the clause feels fully earned. The emotional cost of tasting and then rejecting perfection is legible in the brief but potent snowfall scene. Relationships are mostly remembered rather than on-page, but the mother’s presence still meaningfully shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply drawn as a failed revolutionary turned heterodox scholar, with motives (reimagine the civilization, defend a more collective past) that clearly drive their choices. Ledger, though mostly summarized, functions as a legible foil whose skepticism raises real stakes. Internal conflict—fear that they are simply projecting their “poet’s hunger” onto the past—is present but more implied than deeply dramatized in embodied moments. The emotional life trends conceptual and lyrical rather than fully felt in the body, which keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The repairman’s honesty-curse, professional tenderness, and buried guilt over the stolen lullaby give him a distinct inner life, and his choices (demanding truth, confessing, sacrificing his shadow) are cleanly motivated. “I wilt near dishonesty” is paid off somatically with knees folding and “knuckles to rain,” not just as a label. Internal conflict between his need for truth and his past betrayal is present but could be pushed harder at the peak moment. Still, his final acceptance of a lifelong, costly duty reads as an earned stance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to seek the place where explanations fail—is clear, specific, and carries through every beat, and her sensibly methodical eccentricity feels lived-in rather than quirky for its own sake. The grief turn via the compass/father/widow connection is emotionally credible and earned by prior set-up. Internal contradiction—hungry for answers yet honoring mystery—shows up in choices like offering the compass to the lagoon, then accepting its refusal. The only minor limitation is that some realizations (“That is the lesson the lagoon gives…”) come off as slightly tidier than her otherwise messy, embodied inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s vocation, worldview, and motive (a salvager of meaning as much as wood) are sharply etched, and her choices—using the slide, building the gate, stepping through, vowing—track cleanly with those traits. Interiority is vivid and specific, not generic “feeling language.” However, there’s little on-page contradiction or real internal struggle; she is almost entirely sure-footed in her purpose, which softens the sense of cost. Relationships (grandmother/future girl) are evocative but remain mostly symbolic rather than pressured dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s sensibility and vocation are sharply etched, and her motive—understanding night-blooming—is consistently embodied in choices (climbing the scaffold, waiting through vespers, building the mural over seasons). Interiority is concrete and particular (“reckon the pattern by scent and silence”), with a believable, obsessive patience. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—she is both scientific (tracking temperatures, phases) and mystic, yet the tension rarely sharpens into a true on-page dilemma. The final realization that her murals are “doors” feels earned, but the cost of that devotion (what she loses or risks) is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s motivation—to uncover and record suppressed truth even at personal cost—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to their profession. Interiority is vivid (“my motive simple and ruinous”), and the willingness to endure the scalding reverie feels earned. The grandmother and clerk are sketched economically but carry credible moral weight and pressure. What’s slightly missing, for the very top band, is a sharper on-page depiction of contradictory impulses (self-preservation vs duty) in direct collision rather than mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iria’s motives—refusing wishes, choosing labor and shared authority—are coherent and carry through her actions from unrolling maps to formalizing a charter. Interiority is more implied than deeply dramatized; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or emotional vulnerability under strain, which slightly flattens her. Her dynamic with the sailor is clear but not heavily pressurized; their collaboration is harmonious rather than testing her flaws. The final “ticking” beat reads as an earned endurance/renunciation, but the personal cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, history, and present dilemma interlock cleanly: the harbor field trip, the pinned breath, and the oath-scribe role all motivate why this choice matters. Contradictory impulses—duty to archive vs. mercy toward a future child and the orchard—are active on the page and not over-explained. The final refusal to record feels earned and costly, not convenient. A very slight distance from the child whose fate is at stake keeps this just shy of utterly devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation, lineage, and motive are crystal clear and consistently embodied in action (naming Return, accepting and then planting it). Interiority is rich, specific, and character-particular; she feels like a real person with a lived craft and inherited calling. What keeps this shy of the very top is the relative lack of on-page contradiction or friction in her psyche—the acceptance of her role comes almost too smoothly. The cost of stewardship is implied more conceptually than emotionally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s ethos—“favor listening over noise”—is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (stalling the switch, having Reni open shutters, handling the rope) under real institutional pressure. Internal conflict between procedural compliance (valley station, audits, sirens) and embodied/weather-listening practice is clear and resolved with a felt cost. The relationship with Reni functions as a crucible, showing mentorship and influence altering Reni’s behavior at the climax. The only small limit is that we see little genuine emotional fraying; the narrator stays almost too composed, which slightly mutes peak-stress contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The janitor’s interiority is rich and specific—his mix of hiding, yearning for connection, and reverence for maintenance feels particular rather than generic. His arc from “came here to hide” to “polish them into guidance” is credibly earned by accumulated attentiveness to machines and ghosts. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. readiness, wanting repair vs. accepting transparency) are present on the page without over-explained psychologizing. The only small limit is that his prior life and the broken love remain abstract, keeping some potential emotional cost off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The recluse’s motivation—to witness and archive what cannot be spoken—is clear, rooted in his history as a contract broker and his guilt over “the underwritten pesticides.” His choices at the climax (opening the box fully, accepting the bees’ stings, inscribing the sigil) are well motivated and foreclose refusal without feeling pat. Internal conflict is present but mostly implied; we feel his complicity and hesitation, but we don’t fully inhabit the moment of moral vertigo before he commits. A hair more embodied ambiguity at the crucial choice could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—“to understand the texture of time passing”—is clear, consistent, and organically drives every choice from pocketing the urn shard to recruiting Lio and the neighbors. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory metaphors rather than abstract labels, especially around the borrowed heart and the cricket memory. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (duty as “timekeeper” versus surrendering to non-numerical time), which keeps the arc from feeling fully pressured. Lio is distinct and purposeful but remains more an enabling presence than a crucible for sharper relational conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s interiority is specific and consistent—his urge “to discover beauty in the incomplete” is dramatized in how he treats reeds, bottlecaps, the boy, and the kite. The boy is more lightly sketched but still embodied through his stunned grip on the spool and the “distances inside his ribs.” Motivation and action align cleanly: the poet’s choice to intervene, to share the feather, to build the raft all emerge from the same core trait. The emotional change (boy’s relationship to loss) feels earned, though internal contradiction in either character remains relatively gentle rather than sharply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s motive—choosing “work over sorrow” and wanting to “foster interspecies respect before my hourglass failed”—is vivid and consistent, and their micro-choices (wiring, council, otter ramps, final diary placement) all align. Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied interaction through tools and environment rather than abstract labels. What’s missing at an elite level is a sharper contradiction or visible flaw; the caretaker is almost wholly serene and wise, so we rarely see them make a costly mistake or act from less-than-enlightened impulse. The final renunciation (lying down to die) feels earned but not strongly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” identity and scientific frame are consistent and motivating, from bringing the amber as an experiment to resisting “ritual” while still participating. Interior conflict—skepticism vs. curiosity, lab bench vs. chapel—is clear but remains low-temperature, more contemplative than pressured. The final repricing of “home” as a rate constant is earned by prior perceptions and choices. Emotional embodiment could be a touch more visceral to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coachman’s motives—atonement, concord, and patient re-making—are clear and consistently embodied in his work with seeds, languages, and birds. His past as a soldier’s driver quietly tensions his present as a gardener, giving his actions moral grain without overt statement. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he honors ghosts while refusing to dismiss them, tending violence into shelter rather than erasing it. A sharper moment of doubt or temptation could have deepened the felt cost of his chosen endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation and interiority are rich and specific: the drive to turn the leaf into a compass and to “translate distance into closeness” coheres with the narrator’s history and ledger-keeper sensibility. Emotional experience is embodied through sensory perception (smell of grief, the waxed leaf, Harbor’s reactions) rather than labels. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under direct pressure stays relatively soft; we don’t see a sharp competing impulse that truly risks derailing the choice to seek the relay. Still, the endurance and small renunciations at the end feel well earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s “blessed pariah” identity is concrete and specific, with the reactor decision and its fallout giving real weight to their isolation and uneasy heroism. Motivation (to honor the anniversary, to find a usable “true north”) is clear and drives each on-page choice. Contradictory impulses—guilt vs. stubborn conviction, fear of darkness vs. reliance on it—are woven into perception rather than spelled out. The final stance (embracing a self-made axis and the dark they carry) feels earned by prior beats and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s chivalrous-thief ethic and “apprentice of wonder” identity are vivid and consistent, and their trembling yet continuing to act under pressure feels earned. Internal contradiction (fear vs. wonder, thief vs. mender) is present though kept at a lyrical, not deeply tortured, register. The choice to substitute their own promises into the pieces, especially the queen, is well-motivated by prior traits. The emotional cost—accepting ongoing unpaid mending—registers but could be shaded with one more moment of genuine reluctance to be fully piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in a sharp contradiction between “crisis actor” and “real crisis survivor,” and that tension credibly drives their project to archive “small gestures.” Embodied details like holding “shaking elbows steady” and the loosening of “the role of victim” as a costume give emotional reality without therapy-speak. Change is quiet but legible: they move from being defined by scripts to self-chosen stewardship of memory. The only limit is that other individuals remain faceless archetypes (nurse, janitor, widow) rather than full relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s drive—to recover a silenced mouth and the “shape of home”—is clear, consistent, and well-motivated, with shame over their accent functioning as a credible buried flaw. Interiority is vivid and particular (“the ache of a key searching for a door”), though moments of internal contradiction under immediate pressure are more implied than dramatized. The seer is a strong, coherent secondary presence whose choices constantly push the narrator forward rather than serving as mere oracle. The final stance—to seed tongue and steps with recovered language—feels earned, though the emotional struggle to accept this could be slightly more contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The exiled chess tutor is sharply etched: guilt, professional pride, and a pattern-seeing mind all inform his choices. His core conflict—between the gratifying “brilliant sacrifice” of freeing the village at once and the slower, tutelary method—arises organically from his past failure with the prince. Emotions are embodied and particular (“felt my exile curl tight around my throat, then loosen thoughtfully”). The final choice feels fully motivated and carries a visible cost in foregone dramatic satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist’s motivation (to challenge the forgiveness ritual and his unresolved debt to his mentor) is clear and consistently dramatized, especially in the memory of the stolen paints and the final double payment. Interiority is mostly implied through sensory and symbolic focus rather than explicit thought, but it still feels particular and lived. The relationship with the child and elders provides a legible status dynamic and pressure, though more on-page conflict with the elders could deepen it. The closing release of his internal weight (“felt the weight inside him at last unclench”) is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—turning grief and corrosive surroundings into “meaning from the edge of oblivion”—is specific, consistent, and drives every micro-choice at the bench. His uncertainty versus compulsion (“That promise was light once, now it is lead in my chest”) gives him a credible internal contradiction. Actions like choosing the charm as the final pendulum and continuing to solder after the engine’s revelation feel earned by what we’ve seen of him. The only minor limit is that his flaws and self-deceptions are not pushed quite as hard as they could be under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The painter’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent: fear, nostalgia, and self-contempt for “vanishing into copies” all coexist in the moment of entering the caves. Motivation is cleanly rooted in the long-deferred vow to “paint the inside of the sea,” and each action (choosing the brine-smelling path, dipping the shell, adding only a breath of paint, leaving the corridor) flows credibly from that. The final renunciation—refusing to live in the painting and returning to the cracked mirror—is an earned endurance with visible cost. Emotional states are mostly embodied through image and environment rather than label-only feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The keeper’s motive—to prove the power of whispers over shouts—permeates choices from mopping in the quiet to orchestrating the scented beckoning. Interiority is specific and textured (“breath steadies and loses its need to be right”), and the relationship with the mentor shifts credibly in the final beats. Internal contradiction is quieter than it could be; the keeper is remarkably self-possessed, with little dramatized doubt or failure. Still, the emotional throughline feels coherent and earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s grief-driven motivation is clear, specific, and consistent, and their choices (agreeing to build, then deciding to leave the station and walk inland) are credibly compelled by that motive. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (“Mara kept singing so I could follow, and I kept counting so she could stop”), with strong tension between longing for Mara and accepting she will not be recovered. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—hope vs. recognition rather than a more overtly dramatized clash—keeping this just shy of maximal depth. The final acceptance that the compass “does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her” feels fully earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a rational, scent-driven forager whose involuntary honesty and cautious, evidence-based mind generate specific tactics (mud on the rim, knot-hole hiding, “careful sequence” of truth). Motivation to protect both the relic and the group’s fragile psychological safety is consistent and persuasive. Internal conflict between rational skepticism and hope in “rumored cures” is present but could be deepened into more overtly fraught contradictions under peak pressure. The endurance at the end—continuing the practice despite risk—reads as an earned stasis with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his “softly persistent” temperament expressed through methodical, almost ritual choices (examining seams, testing the flower in the notch, sending the light-signal). Motivation is clear and rooted in character: he sees himself as an accountant of the sea’s dead, and decoding the gesture fits his self-imposed role. Emotional contradiction exists but is understated—duty vs. eccentricity, belief vs. uncertainty about the answering light—so the arc feels more like deepened endurance than a sharp turn. The final choice to answer and then erase the visible trace (“what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness”) is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a clear tension between the safety of static maps and the risk of honoring Ruth’s promise. Contradictory impulses (“I could leave…instead I looked for evidence…”) are dramatized in the peak moment at the seam. Micro-choices—packing the chip, following the ants, taking the chip back—reveal a hierarchy of values that feels earned. The only small limiter is that we never see the narrator behave *badly* or self-deceptively in the present, which slightly softens the felt cost of change.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The queen’s motivation—hunger to understand the dreams rather than mere escape—is specific and consistent, and her final choice to “wake” her stone self is clearly earned. Interiority is textured (“ghost of unasked questions”), and her self-awareness about her commanding voice feels character-particular rather than generic. The relationship with the wanderer functions as a crucible without being over-explained, especially in his warning about who she will “not be able to forgive.” A touch more in-the-moment emotional contradiction at the peak (terror vs desire at the stone self) could sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s blend of tenderness, rigor, and self-awareness (“my loves are scientifically romantic”) feels specific and drives their choices in the ritual. The relationship dynamic—a teasing but devoted friend whose “secret” sets the experiment in motion—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; the narrator rarely wavers once they commit, so pressure on their flaws remains relatively soft. Still, the final vow to “spend it carefully…not on trophies but on thresholds” reads as an earned reconfiguration of values.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and self-contradictory: a professional of dreams who’s “paid in coffee and leave slips” and weaponizes jealousy against his own past selves. Motivation is clear—he needs to “distill chaos into narrative”—and his micro-choices (touching the scroll, bargaining with nostalgia, choosing to keep walking after his “funeral”) all spring from that drive. The feral nostalgia as hound and creature makes his flaw active rather than abstract. The ending stance—continuing to patrol “the day after my own funeral” while letting the narrative drag him—reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator is sharply particular: an ex-aromatherapist who’s lost smell and now “maps emotional terrain,” which governs how they notice fog, breath, pauses, and water. The father’s fear and tenderness are rendered through behavior (searching windows, the way he holds the clepsydra) rather than label-speak. Micro-choices—keeping the door unlatched, inviting him to touch the clocks, choosing reassurance phrased in his metaphors—reveal a coherent value hierarchy. Internal contradiction (trembling calm, practical ritual amid fragility) is present but understated, which keeps this just shy of fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—to transform scars into stories—is clear, specific, and drives every on-page choice. Interiority is rich and embodied (“my pulse unlatches a notch,” “my lungs become gates”), with concrete past incidents tied to each scar. The superstition vs. scholarship tension gives her some contradiction, though under the time-pressure of a held breath she remains almost too composedly reflective. The final endurance/drinking feels like an earned, quiet shift rather than a tidy cure, which suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s guilt, career compromise, and need for forgiveness are specific and well-motivated, and her choices (building the device, calling the foreman, finally playing) arise organically from those traits. The relationship with Mara is textured despite Mara being mostly a presence on the page, especially via details like reorganizing the catalog by “how the composers smiled.” Internal conflict between professional survival and loyalty is clear, though it’s mostly carried in metaphor rather than embodied stress. The final choice to risk her column to “owe the living” feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation and interiority are rich and specific (“I walked the spiral to bind what could be recalled without lying”), and the hinge realization at the end feels earned by prior beats. Emotional texture stays largely in the conceptual/spiritual register, so embodied contradiction under pressure is more muted than in top-tier pieces. Micro-choices—opening to “Listen,” loosening straps, placing the scroll—do reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost of relinquishing the “end of history witness” identity is implied but could be felt more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—to stay after shift “to understand what clocks really measure”—is clear and consistently expressed in concrete micro-choices (staying late, adjusting Basin Three, deciding to leave the “error” uncorrected). Interiority is specific and embodied (the razor nick, matching blood drips to the stylus), and the grandmother/backstory is tightly tied to present action via the key rather than drifting into summary. There is a credible internal contradiction between official duty (correct drift) and a more heretical, philosophical curiosity, and the final stance (reframing the job as shepherding edges) feels earned from that tension. The only thing holding this just shy of top-tier is that the emotional cost of this reframing—any real risk or loss it entails—remains mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation (to redesign security as hospitality and metabolize grief) is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices—slowing down alarms, tracing the hiss instead of slamming it shut, pathing the cat—embody her contradictions between vigilance and relinquishment. The Kian/cancer backstory is efficient and sharply targeted, reweighting her present choices without turning into therapy-speak. Internal conflict (need for control vs. desire to loosen) is active in-scene rather than summarized. I’m holding just below the top band because the cost of her shift, while implied, could be felt more sharply in one concrete moment of genuine risk or near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and particular—the “compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter” identity informs every perception and decision, from going to the library instead of panicking to how she reads the lantern and stub. Her lucid contradictions (caution vs. attraction to risk) are dramatized, not just told, and the final stance—carrying her father’s system forward with a new ethic—feels earned. Cost is legible in her acceptance that she can’t simply reject or repeat him. Very slight abstraction in places keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s vocation, philosophy (“cultivated estrangement”) and restraint under pressure are sharply drawn and consistent, and her choice not to speak to the rescued child is a strong, earned character beat. We feel her motives in how she uses the glass disc, the loops, and the wrong numbers. What’s slightly missing for the very top tier is a more dramatized, in-the-moment pull between contradictory impulses (her desire to remain estranged vs. an urge to step inside the “doorframes”) rather than that tension staying mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s motivation and worldview are sharply etched and consistent, and the woman’s grief and tentative hope feel specific and embodied (“breath she lost,” fingers on the knot, the locket clicking). The “haunted euphoria” is credible and character-particular rather than generic melancholy. Internal contradiction (tender archivist versus the almost ecstatic response to loss) is present but not fully dramatized as on-page conflict, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The logistician and the narrator are sharply etched through specific, idiosyncratic details (“smile of someone who had traded sleep for maps and return receipts”), and their motives—logistics as cure for loneliness—are consistent and embodied in action. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: the logistician’s tired desperation undercuts their joking competence, and the narrator moves from observer to participant. The emotional arc is more a deepening of stance than a sharp turn, but the final acceptance of the “cure” and taking home the favor-map reads earned. A slightly stronger sense of risk or reluctance from the narrator under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (to map emotional depths without erasing grief) is precise and sustained, and their micro-choices—continuing deeper, kneeling, dowsing again, consenting to the stillpoint rather than fleeing—track that motive cleanly. Interiority is vivid and embodied via tactile and sonic perception rather than diagnostic labels, and the “planet the size of an ache” map is a strong crystallization of their arc. There is credible internal tension between the mercantile past self and the present seeker, though that conflict could tighten slightly under peak pressure. Overall, the final renunciation—accepting grief as coastline rather than seeking its erasure—feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s guilt, caution, and “confident uncertainty” are embodied in specific, credible impulses, especially the impulse to test the pen on their own skin and to write furrows instead of words. The relationship with Del is textured—his gentle authority and their deference create a real crucible in the terrace-writing scene. The final stance (“still uncertain, and still confident enough to bear it”) feels earned by prior ambivalence rather than declared. The only minor limit is that we see little non-professional life beyond the farming backstory, keeping the character slightly in the lyric-idea zone rather than fully lived.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arin’s motivation (“to translate silence into music”) is clear and consistently dramatized through concrete tactics—signing, mapping, the empty camera. The emotional state (“joyful sorrow”) is embodied in specific actions like giving the map to the tide and bowing to the sea. Internal contradiction (desiring recognition yet accepting erasure) is present but stays mostly in implication rather than fully dramatized conflict. The advisor relationship is intriguingly sketched, though it exerts more gentle guidance than hard pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s blend of guilt, fierce protectiveness, and “volcanic tenderness” feels specific and coherently dramatized, especially in the reveal that the arson was an act of protection rather than malice. Her analytically intuitive nature is shown through how she reads patterns in art rather than just asserted. Internal conflict—arsonist vs. caretaker, destroyer vs. preserver—threads the piece and culminates in the choice to rebuild a different kind of library. A slight limitation is that the cost of her stance (social exile, danger) is more implied than directly tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives—to reach Mira and to reclaim agency within the experiment—are clear, specific, and consistently drive choices (sneaking to the garden, accepting the donors’ fragments). Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“ribs hollowed like flutes,” “I gave them my wrists like roses”), with a credible mix of resignation, defiance, and tenderness. The relationship with Mira under pressure feels like a crucible, culminating in a shared decision to “honor the after by learning its music.” The only ceilinging factor is that internal contradiction (resenting the experiment yet volunteering to carry extra memories) could surface with slightly more explicit friction in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivo is vivid, competent, and particular—his tactile relationship to the maze and the way he “reads” walks and steel make him feel specific rather than generic. His motivation (rescue plus proving a principle) is clear and consistent, and his quiet status-play with Rade is nicely handled. What’s missing at an elite level is real internal friction or visible cost: Ivo never seems seriously taxed, morally or emotionally, so his arc is more demonstration than transformation. Rade softens slightly, but that shift is quick and lightly sketched rather than earned through layered conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s grief, shame, and longing to “teach darkness the value of stars” are specific, embodied, and drive every choice, from waiting on the dock to accepting and using the mirror. The brother’s suicide and the town’s love of his silence give the narrator’s conflict a credible, painful spine. The guardian is opaque but coherent, defined through action and gesture rather than exposition. The final internal shift—voice returning “like floodwater” and the decision to carry the mirror forward—feels earned and carries cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coach’s motivation—to slow the town’s reflex to decide—is concrete, consistent, and revealed through specific tactics (stalemates, window displays) rather than labels. Interiority is vivid and particular (“my chest felt like open ground”), and the contradiction between trembling uncertainty and deliberate orchestration is compelling. The final stance—a tender acceptance of “next moves unfinished”—is clearly earned. I’d push for one sharper moment where their risk or doubt faces real resistance on the page to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and embodied; the tension between “hardshell” and hidden grace, and the fear/longing around naming, feels deeply particular. The motivation to claim a true name and nature under communal scrutiny is clear and escalates credibly. Contradictory impulses—wanting to cross, fearing exposure, craving witnesses—are all in play, especially around the crowd and the scrimshaw. The only thing holding this just short of top-tier is that the social cost from the crowd remains largely supportive, so the risk feels a shade safer than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and particular: the narrator’s blend of professional compliance, private resistance, and numb vacancy (“They like my neutrality; it looks like victory in certain lighting”) creates a complex, lived character. Her choices—to teach “compliance postures” while also teaching the unflaggable pause, to stage off-mic lessons, to end on “not joy, but lightness”—all feel motivated by that tension. The moral compromise of taking tokens from parents who need them is acknowledged rather than hedged. The only thing holding this just shy of the top band is that her inner conflict, while strong, rarely tips into real on-page self-sabotage or mistake under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The collective “we,” the cloud-shadow poet, and the former guard are all sharply sketched through action and image rather than exposition, and their motives (fear vs. longing for connection) are consistent and legible. The poet’s drive to “stride through boundaries” clearly motivates each escalation, and the guard’s quiet renunciation (removing his badge) reads as a credible, costly turn. The choral POV limits granular internal contradiction in any one individual, so we don’t get deep micro-conflict, but the communal ambivalence is well rendered. Overall, characterization supports the thematic and structural aims with only the tradeoff of less individual interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ivo’s characterization is vivid and particular—his colorblindness, sensory workarounds, and “innocently cunning” nature all manifest in concrete choices (what he trades, how he uses the reed, his decision to stay). Motivation is clear and consistent: he wants beauty in imperfection and pursues it via bartering, listening, and painting temperature rather than hue. Internal conflict is understated but present in the tension between hoping for color and accepting a different awakening. The relationship with Mira, conducted through plants, is subtle yet emotionally legible and evolves across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s vocation and motive (“discover the texture of connection”) are vivid and specific, and their “powerfully gentle” approach to the bells reveals a coherent inner life. However, internal contradiction and on-page cost are relatively muted; this is a character under pressure only in a quiet, reflective sense. The volunteer with the drowned brother briefly sharpens emotional stakes, but the narrator’s own conflict remains largely conceptual. The endurance at the end (continuing the pilgrimage without full understanding) reads as an earned stance, but not a deeply tested one.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s grief, craft-identity, and guilt about “mangling” intention and action form a coherent, specific psychology that drives every choice. Her shift from failed artisan to “tutor of endings” feels fully earned by her history with Devin and the observatory. Contradictory impulses—despair vs. care for others, withdrawal vs. outreach—coexist, especially in the way she waits alone on nights when no one comes. The endurance at the end is an earned stasis that clearly forecloses retreat into numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer and the narrator are sharply etched through behavior, tools, and worldview, with the mentor’s ethics (“refusal would teach the wrong lesson about value”) and the apprentice’s tactile learning giving them specificity. Emotional states are mostly implied rather than dramatized in crisis, which fits the lyric mode but slightly mutes felt cost. The relationship dynamic—teacher handing down a fraught craft—carries real weight and progresses credibly over the night. What keeps this short of top-tier is the relative absence of on-page inner contradiction or a hard, costly choice for the narrator by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation is clear and particular (“forbidden knowledge without the arrogance of conquest, yet with the hunger of drought”), and their choices—accepting the pagoda’s invitation, refusing the tablets, declining to publish—track coherently. Internal conflict between hunger and ethical restraint is present throughout, though it stays more archetypal than deeply individuated. The bronze-and-wind child gives a relational crucible that sharpens the narrator’s stance without stealing focus. The final renunciation (teaching instead of publishing) feels earned and carries a quiet but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira and Ilen both feel particular and coherent, with motives grounded in vocation and weariness (“her work was to tend the stacks…,” “his laugh already bruised with worry”). Mira’s decision to risk the library’s balance and then sacrifice her own stored dreams is well-motivated by her tendency to “preserve the shape of hope.” Interiority is mostly carried through externalized perception and metaphor rather than explicit thought, so her internal contradictions (duty vs. compassion, curator vs. giver) are more implied than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation of her own unlived futures reads earned, but a touch more on-page ambivalence at the moment of sacrifice would deepen the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The handler’s interiority is rich, specific, and ethically fraught, with clear contradictory impulses—rage vs. precision, despair vs. determination—acting at once (“I did not invite rage; I invited precision.”). Her choices under pressure (amputating the tail, stripping the terrarium, writing the letter that names names) all grow convincingly from her mix of guilt, care, and stubborn hope. The endurance at the end—continuing the work under scrutiny instead of resigning—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible cost. A slight limit is that we don’t see a relationship under live pressure on the page, so status dynamics remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s internal contradiction—“closure seeker who opens wounds,” burdened with a misallocated miracle—feels rich and specific, and their choices (seeking numbness, then going to the tunnel to relinquish something) are clearly motivated. Embodied emotion is strong in details like pins of sensation, loam-tasting breath, and trembling hands. The final act reads as an earned, costly stance shift rather than a tidy cure. The only minor limit is that no other on-page human relationship applies pressure in the present, so the crucible is largely internal and retrospective.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal gazer’s interiority is specific and vivid—her “spatially imaginative” mapping of feelings into rooms and aisles is character-particular rather than generic mystic talk. Her motivation (to locate unused love) is clear and carries through to the personal turn when she finds boxes labeled with her own name. The internal conflict between professional detachment and her shelved personal life surfaces credibly at the climax. The only slight limitation is how smoothly the realization lands; it borders on tidiness rather than real mess or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s vocation, burden of hearing unspoken words, and “shadowed rapture” are distinct and consistent, and their motivation to free others to relieve their own inner grave is clear and compelling. Internal conflict—gift vs. curse, fatigue vs. compulsion—is present but could be dramatized more in specific moments of hesitation or misjudgment rather than mostly declared. The relationship with the sculptor lands emotionally at the handoff of the pages, giving a concrete pivot for their role. The final acceptance of ongoing duty feels earned, though the personal cost could be made slightly sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guard’s motivation—to “cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners” and guard against erasure—is clear, consistent, and drives concrete choices (singing the charm, accepting the “game,” placing spores along the train). Interiority is particular and embodied through task and metaphor rather than labels, and the dreamless endurance at the end reads as an Earned Stasis with cost. The internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; being “dreamless” and “occasionally everywhere” hints at contradiction but isn’t fully pressure-tested in scene. A slightly sharper moment of hesitation or self-cost around engaging the archive could deepen character complexity at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philosopher’s motives and contradictions are clear and particular: he’s drawn to repair the tree while believing ruin “teaches what perfection hides,” and that tension drives the key choice. His interiority is textured and specific rather than generic, with the sixth sense and translocation shaping his worldview. Emotional stakes skew cerebral rather than viscerally embodied, so the ache and risk remain more conceptual than deeply felt in the body. The final repricing—accepting repair as “the risk that frees thought”—is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s fear, longing for “unused courage,” and gradual willingness to walk where she once refused are all clearly motivated and internally coherent. The ferry guides function as distinct, archetypal presences whose patience and instruction sharpen her conflict without stealing the arc. The final reach for the shimmer at her ankles feels earned by the earlier refusal (“I do not reach, not yet”), making the change legible and costly. If anything, the character remains slightly abstract—more emblematic than individuated—which keeps this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and particular (“During nerve regeneration, the body writes letters in shocks”), and the narrator’s motives—healing and understanding the cost of safety—are clear and consistent. Contradictory impulses (need for protection vs hunger for music/connection) are present but stay somewhat conceptual rather than dramatized in sharper, character-specific moments. The bellhop functions as a strong foil/guide, exerting gentle but clear pressure (the bolt, the zipper gesture, the breath on glass). The final choice to remain and “play easing” feels earned and closes off an easier path of mere compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyr is sharply etched—a “small sovereign of dust and patience” with a clear, consistent motive and tactics—and his quiet ruthlessness feels earned. Serane’s arc from polished confidence to renunciation is effective but somewhat under-embodied; we witness her unraveling mostly through metaphor and external gesture rather than felt interior contradiction. The relationship dynamic (overlooked titan vs radiant pretender) is strong and drives status play without ever being baldly stated. The final renunciation reads motivated, though an extra beat of her resisting or bargaining might deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to discover why some paths disappear”) is clear and consistently drives her choices: taking the post, pressing Assemble, decoding taps, and calling the village. Interiority is specific and embodied through habits (“a practice of tapping rhythms”) and reef-witness backstory without therapy-speak. There’s a quiet but real evolution from solitary observer to communal guide, with the cost of accepting that nothing can be fixed in place. The only minor limitation is that internal contradiction (fear vs duty, grief vs curiosity) is implied more than sharply dramatized under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—“not a fighter” yet compelled to “hunt echoes”—and her choices (following the tremor, risking the machine, broadcasting the map) consistently express that drive. The barefoot detail and inherited connection to the bay make her embodied and particular. Internal conflict is present but fairly gentle; she moves toward action with relatively little friction or self-sabotage. The final change in her—shifting from private seeker to someone who “carry[ies] thunderous serenity” to others—feels earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lida’s motivation is vivid and consistent—her history with occupation, plants, and tradition clearly drives her toward the unsealing—and her choices at each step align with that. What’s slightly missing, given the stakes, is a more present-tense sense of fear or doubt as she defies the council; she reads a touch too serenely correct. Interiority is otherwise rich and particular (the shrapnel and sap accident, the way she “shows” the vine her world). The relationship with the council is sketched effectively but could use one more embodied exchange to deepen that crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rafi’s motivations—seeking patient, honest work after a drone strike—are specific and consistently dramatized, and his trauma responses feel embodied rather than labeled. His freezing under rotor-like sounds and his choice to keep working “by that feeling” show contradictory impulses (retreat vs tending) operating simultaneously. Relationships (with Leda and the niece) sharpen his choices without resolving him too neatly. The final image of how he now holds the photograph makes his quiet endurance and altered stance fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear from the outset—fleeing a city that has turned her art into masks toward “necessary darkness”—and her choices (mapping the shelves, descending, accepting the keeper’s role) consistently align with that drive. Her interiority is specific and embodied (“luminescent ache…after a bruise,” “save her eye from its habitual dimming”), not generic. The core internal tension—whether she’s here to rescue the lighthouse or herself—culminates cleanly in the decision to “keep the light tonight” and “the faces that come to it,” an earned reorientation of values. A hair more on-page friction or hesitation in the gearhouse could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation (to understand and then end the market in slowed crisis-time) is clear and consistent, and the mentor backstory gives that drive specific emotional contour. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“a silhouette that refuses to darken,” “consciously wild stillness”), with actions that align with serene anger rather than melodrama. The final refusal of the throne and self-erasure feel earned by what we know of their values and history. A touch more embodied contradiction under peak pressure (a moment of real temptation or fear) could deepen the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s motivations—duty to preservation versus hunger for escape and connection—are sharply drawn and consistently drive each micro-choice. The internal contradiction is active on the page (“bravely conflicted, faithful to preservation and starving for escape”) and culminates in a credible, costly decision. Emotional life is embodied through the environment and work rituals rather than abstract labels. The only slight limitation is that we never see any specific personal stake (e.g., relationships, history) beyond their role, which keeps them just shy of fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a pacifist shaped by a bounty hunter father, whose restraint and sensate empathy drive every choice. Her conflict between inherited tracking/harm and chosen tending/mercy is active in how she manages the knife, the visitors, and the myth of her father. The visitors function as focused external pressure, forcing her stance into action rather than abstraction. The final endurance—keeping the farm open despite his absence and blame—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fisher’s motivation—to recover the coastline by listening for the goddess’s echo—is clear, consistent, and colored by specific traits (“cool-headed,” “calm is a net you mend every hour”). Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory metaphors rather than abstract labels. Internal conflict is present but mild; he is never truly tempted to do anything but listen and return, so the final renunciation carries more beauty than sharp cost. Still, the closing act of giving the map back does mark a credible, earned stance rather than a hollow gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The heiress’s motivation and internal texture are rich and specific—her loyalty to ink, logic, and her father’s legacy all inform her choices, especially the proof-by-contradiction wager. The caretaker is economically but vividly sketched; his “wanted to help…not to drown sailors” adds moral shading rather than easy villainy. Interiority remains concrete and non-therapeutic, with embodied details like the pen’s smell and the stairs “keeping me honest.” The final decision to fund the observatory as a sanctuary feels earned, though the emotional cost of opposing her board/family could be made slightly more palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—translating cries, accepting the cabinet, ultimately tattooing herself—track tightly with that psychology. Interiority is specific and embodied through craft (“each star a dot quiet as meteor hush”) rather than abstract labels. The push-pull between wanting to imagine her work as “maps forward” and knowing it’s really about old guilt gives real internal contradiction. The only slight limit is that the original abandonment remains somewhat impressionistic, which keeps her flaw from cutting quite as jaggedly as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator is sharply drawn—a whimsical, hyper-attentive chalk artist whose perceptual habits are consistently dramatized (e.g., “reading crowds by their silences,” sensing “social weather”). Her key choices—laying chalk arcs, interjecting with the bearded man, placing the tile, smudging the map—align with this temperament and feel motivated. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (comfort with mess vs. urge to “interject” and shape it) rather than fully dramatized. Secondary figures (Pallas, the bearded man, the child) are sketched with specificity and serve as pressure points rather than full characters, which caps depth slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—“warm coldness,” “aberrant mercy,” a gentle radical who mends ruin—feels specific and embodied in choices, especially in refusing a punitive verdict for the arsonists. Motivation is clear and consistent, and the small but real arc (reaffirming the costful choice to practice this mercy) is earned. The boy is sketched efficiently and believably; the men are more archetypal but still function under the thematic pressure. A slightly sharper sense of the narrator’s personal risk or emotional fraying in the climactic renaming could lift this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator and the ghost both feel particular—cashier/keeper of time with synesthesia, and an “encore-seeking” gentleman of curtains and dust. Motivation is clear (maintaining and gently releasing a fractured timeline together), and the narrator’s micro-choices—following the blue chord, anchoring the Star, speaking old marquee letters—track well. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper contradiction or visible internal conflict; the narrator rarely feels torn, only dutiful and wistful. The relationship dynamic is tender but relatively static, with little change in their power balance or mutual stance beyond a soft deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivations are clear and specific—Mara’s desire to soften her brother’s last words and the narrator’s to find the father’s map—and the relationship feels textured (“my affectionate skeptic”). The piece shows them under gentle but real pressure (misreading somatic signals, Mara’s flinch-or-don’t at the brother memory). Change is credible but quiet: by the end, they inhabit their grief differently rather than being “cured.” The main limitation is that internal conflict rarely spikes into truly difficult on-page choices; much of the struggle remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s vocation, values, and motivation (“to become the voice of the unknown, without presuming to own it”) are vivid and consistent, and we see her make concrete, value-driven choices (following the green vein, waiting, then leaving the fossil behind). Internal conflict is present but subtle—her tension between speaking and not appropriating is more stated than dramatized in moments of genuine doubt. Emotional texture is embodied via sensory focus rather than labels, which works, but the serenity of the piece leaves little sense of genuine psychological struggle under pressure. The final renunciation (logging the fossil as resident, not carried) is earned and legible as a small but real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s role, desire to reframe prophecy, and tactile relation to objects (sand, resin, buttons, jars) feel specific and convincing. Motivation for theft and ritual is clear and consistent, and the shift from “counting to keeping, from keeping to offering” reads as an earned internal reorientation. What’s missing for the very top band is stronger on-page contradiction or fear—her risk vis-à-vis the elders and her own conditioning is largely implied rather than dramatized in conflicted interior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ansel’s characterization is rich and specific: the burned spy whose “face carried fire's old map” but whose eyes still “counted possibilities without mercy” feels vividly individual. His inner drive (unused courage, loyalty to the dead, need for repair) is dramatized in concrete choices, especially the decision to consign the microfilm to the sea and keep the ring. The relationship with Len functions as a crucible; status and trust are renegotiated on the page, culminating in the physical touch on his wrist. The final internal shift—understanding courage as something practiced rather than spent—is earned by the preceding beats and costs him his old stance of self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman and Wren are distinct, textured figures whose motives (keeping the promise, transforming fear into something navigable) are clear and consistent. His patience and her active weaving/decision-making generate a quiet but credible internal tension between burden and forward motion. However, the internal conflict stays relatively implicit; we don’t see him seriously tempted to maintain his old “gloom-hill” stance, so the final easing of his burdens costs less on the page than it might. The relationship shifts toward partnership in a satisfying way, but the emotional arc could bear one sharper, more conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    The potter’s motivation is clear from the outset—“to understand why some places resist change, or to fail gracefully while trying”—and every major choice (using the last of her water, lingering to make cups) flows from that intent. Her interiority is specific and embodied through craft metaphors (“breath measured like a slow kick wheel,” “bowls that hold by shape, not grip”). The arc from inquiry to a vowed practice of steady tenderness is credible, if quietly drawn. What keeps this just shy of top-tier is the near-total absence of internal contradiction or real doubt; she feels almost too serene and competent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives—grief, inherited craft, and the need to make neglected things work again—are specific and consistent, and they clearly drive the decision to relight the lighthouse. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my cloth moving in circles small enough to keep the past from sloshing out all at once”), with no stock emotion labels. Internal conflict is quieter but present: fear and shaking wrists against duty and competence, resolved into a costly-seeming choice to keep tending light beyond this night. The only small limit is that the inner contradiction is more implied than directly pressured by an opposing force on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s vocation, history with extinct species, and articulated motivation (“to translate isolation into independence”) create a coherent, specific interiority. Micro-choices—polishing and deploying the sundial, answering the fossil voices, choosing to sing the herd song—feel motivated and consistent. Internal conflict between solitude and connection is present but skewed toward articulated insight over embodied contradiction. Emotional texture stays a bit abstract and cerebral, which slightly blunts the felt cost of their endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator is sharply defined through occupation, sensibility, and tactics, and their wish to “find the thread that connects all things” versus merely “keep both sets of letters safe” gives a credible, if quiet, internal tension. The lovers are intentionally archetypal but still feel particular through details like “bearing stormlight as if it were a shy animal.” Emotional progression is coherent but low-friction; there’s little sense of genuine risk that they might not rejoin. The final reconfiguration—recognizing that their “whimsical” methods are actually bridges—feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s blend of skepticism, duty, and “cautiously hopeful” pragmatism is sharply drawn and stays consistent under pressure. Her motives—protecting genuine choice versus surrendering to seductive control—credibly drive every key action from rooftop investigation to subsonic counter-broadcast. Internal conflict (temptation by offers of tenure and painless nights vs. her ethic of evidence and breath) is present and resolved with a felt though quiet cost. The main slip is that the final maxim (“teach people their breath”) edges toward tidy aphorism, though it’s fairly well earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s blend of claustrophobia and compulsion to keep moving is vivid and specific, and it meaningfully colors every choice (“stillness feels like a smaller room than any cave”). Motivation to retrieve the key and confront the city’s mutiny is steady, with embodied anxiety in the alleys and at the narrowing air beats. Internal contradiction—prudence vs rebellion—is dramatized via micro-choices (chalk commas, exit strategy, but still going to the forbidden Observatory). The cost remains mostly anticipatory rather than sharply dramatized, which softens the final inflection of change.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in prosopagnosia and methodical attention; details like “I draw the way riverbeds remember water” feel character-particular, not generic. Motivation—working cold cases through art to serve families and the missing—is clear and consistent. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page contradiction or live internal struggle under pressure; the piece is more reflective than conflict-driven. The ending’s renunciation (“I do not know who harmed her”) is earned but emotionally understated as a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The librarian’s motives (honoring the ancestor, resistance to bureaucratic cruelty, love for Liza) are vivid and consistent, and their choices drive every major turn, from decoding the journals to defying the director. Interiority is specific and embodied (“spongey dread,” “a carrot shaped like a shuttered door”) rather than generic. Internal conflict—fear versus idealism—is present but not deeply stressed under peak pressure, so the final stance feels more assured than costly. The director is sharply sketched as a foil, and Liza’s brief appearance still lands emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and particular—“dynamically observant, tuned to edges” is consistently borne out in how she reads scaffolds, arrows, and light. Her motivation to retrieve/forgive the hitchhiker and to test the “ledger” is clear and escalates naturally into the river-bridge scene. The relationship feels lived-in through tiny specifics (names tried on “like jackets,” sideways smiles) rather than exposition. If anything, the internal conflict about risking herself for him could be sharpened a notch further on the page before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a thief’s son who builds a startup to sell routes while half-believing in inescapable circles. His emotional life is particularized through objects (bills, ribbons, posters) rather than labels, and his endurance at the end feels like an earned stasis with cost. The relationship to the coders and investors is sketched more symbolically than as live crucibles under pressure, but it still reflects values under strain. Overall the final acceptance of circularity and memory as “signs” reads fully motivated by what precedes.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation (decoding the temple and offering witness) is clear, consistent, and deepens as Mara arrives and the joint reading begins. Interiority is specific and embodied—fear of opening the telegram, the daylily rasping the knuckle, the sense of “midnight solace.” The relationship with Mara is sketched economically but with textured history and status (her father’s dome, her urgency, the narrator’s self-defined role as healer by attention). The internal conflict is relatively gentle, but the choice to open the telegram and commit to continued witnessing lands as a credible, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The druid’s guarded, warlike serenity and professional competence are vivid, and her micro-choices (deploying the seed, negotiating with the lake, insisting the mayor re-speak the truth) are consistent and motivated. Internal conflict—professional detachment vs. personal need to see what mirrors hide—is present but under-dramatized, more stated than pressed into a hard choice. The mayor functions more as a culpable emblem than a fully realized counterpart, though his trembling and blanket “shield” give him some human texture. The final “unbending” of her guarded heart works, but the cost could be shaded more sharply to deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motives (to understand the breach, reclaim agency, and renegotiate the covenant) are clear and consistently embodied in concrete choices—accepting the scar-bridge, heeding the leaves, refusing the old vow. “Brave and foolish in equal measure” plus “purposefully curious” give a credible internal contradiction that colors each decision. However, emotional interiority is more implied through image than deeply dramatized; we rarely feel moment-to-moment fear, doubt, or temptation at peak beats. The woman functions effectively as a pressure-bearing secondary character but remains thematically emblematic more than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority and motive are vivid and specific—“kindness was my blade” and giving the boy her name are excellent character-revealing choices—and the final decision to stay and tend the seeds feels earned. The narrator’s “reckless idealist” nature is consistently dramatized rather than asserted. Internal contradiction (recklessness vs. learned caution) is present but not deeply pressure-tested on the page, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and credibly conflicted: his “facts first” professional armor strains against the grief and guilt tied to Leon. Micro-choices—taking the job after humiliation, handling the scrap, ultimately assigning it exceptional value—track cleanly with his motives and flaws. The endurance at the end (choosing to believe while still doing the job) feels like an earned stasis with real cost. Bowers is lightly drawn but functions well as a low-pressure foil rather than a full crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s blend of “kindly methodical” craftsperson and ambitious seeker of liminal physics is distinct and consistent, and their final realization about “keeping company as it bridged” is well earned. Motivation (to restore the arbor and understand transition) is clear and drives concrete actions like node adjustments and planting the seed. The internal tension between wanting to “own” transition and accepting accompaniment is present but mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. A touch more bodily/emotional disarray under pressure could deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The titan-gear librarian is vividly particular in perception and role, and his quiet devotion to “preserve wonder in routine” tracks cleanly through his choices with the woman and the words. However, his interior conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as simultaneous, contradictory impulses on the page. The emotional cost of his endless, solitary stewardship is implied rather than fully felt. The woman is more function than person, with just enough specificity (“coat of kelp,” “expression like thaw”) to carry the central interaction but little pressure back on him.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inspector’s internal conflict—“My training said isolate, calculate, fortify; my pulse said listen, braid, release”—is sharply rendered and motivates the final choice. Interiority is specific and character-particular, tying professional detail (bunker audits, “years spent measuring doors for panic”) to a very non-standard emotional vocation. The shift from “ledger and a lockpick” to “conduit who acquires abandoned hopes and returns them gently” feels earned by the accumulating experience with the shell and pearl. If anything, a few lines edge toward aphorism rather than embodied contradiction, but the core arc remains convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s guilt, professional arrogance, and “daringly methodical” nature are sharply etched and consistently drive micro-choices (copying graffiti, weighing ink pressure, lying down with the bellows). The emotional throughline from self-punishment to a more honest acceptance of limits feels earned and specific, especially in “I had made it a mirror of me instead of a muscle of earth.” Internal conflict between self-blame and a desire to reclaim her vocation runs under nearly every paragraph. A minor restraint is that the final self-reframing comes close to tidy insight, though it mostly resists flattening into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s desire “to find the library of unspoken words before silence hardened” is vivid and consistent, and the tension between hurry and the requirement to wait gives her an internal contradiction that feels earned. Embodied touches like matching her breathing to the watch’s “stuttered river” keep the interiority grounded despite the abstraction. The culminating shift—accepting the role of messenger who must burn the first letter and wait for an echo—reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a neat epiphany. The only limit is that much of her psychology is expressed through concept rather than fully fleshed personal history, which slightly mutes emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ilya’s motives are clear and layered: financial security, professional duty as a provenance researcher, loyalty to the frostburned woman, and his dangerous dream of propagation all pull at him simultaneously. His internal conflict is dramatized rather than summarized (“He weighed a dream against an empire and found the empire light as labels”), and the final act of destroying the violin feels fully earned. Emotional texture is embodied through idiosyncratic images rather than labels, and his flaws (complicity with the empire, temptation of safety) actively complicate the choice. A secondary relationship on the page is absent, so relational crucible dynamics aren’t tested, which keeps this short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is sharply rendered: a professional whose ritual competence coexists with genuine, contained grief, and whose micro-choices (recalibrating a frowned‑upon device, staying until the aurora fades) all align with her motivation. The mentor is present mainly through memory and ethos, but feels particular and influential, not generic. Internal conflict is subtle rather than overt—more tension between guild orthodoxy and her faith in the chip than any deep moral fracture—so the emotional struggle is strong but not searing. The final endurance/acceptance beat (keeping only a shimmer, not seeking resurrection) is well earned and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The caretaker’s motives (repairing what the mother “spilled,” seeking contentment) are specific and consistent, and her micro-choices—using the hairpin, accepting the pruning stool, planting the map—express a credible, quiet arc from grasping to tending. The relationship with the mother, though off-page, feels textured via the hairpin, the “coughs and laughter,” and the late dream. Contradictory impulses (leaving vs. loving vs. forgiving) are implied more than dramatized in-scene, which slightly softens the sense of live internal conflict. The final renunciation of the hairpin reads earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conscience-for-hire narrator and Lark both feel specific, with motives that are clear, consistent, and in tension: her fear of certainty and scandal vs. his professionalized doubt. Interiority is sharp and character-particular (“charges by the breath it saves,” “protected vulnerability”), and their status dynamic (client vs. moral consultant) is legible and alive. The final choice—to “speak and set terms”—is well earned by prior contradictions (rescue vs. rot, truth vs. image). A hair more embodied, fraught hesitation from Lark on the page during the chime-reading could deepen the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motives are clear and particular—the narrator’s desire “to study disappearance, to learn how to be seen” and the researcher’s mission to “teach vanishing to appear” create a strong, specific tension. The internal conflict between craving answers and learning to accept withheld knowledge is dramatized through micro-choices (asking questions, agreeing to stay until the water forgets the stone, consenting to “release” in the village vision). The relationship dynamic is rich: the researcher’s reverse aging and gentle authority continually pressure the narrator’s need. The only brake on an even higher score is that the narrator’s life outside the lesson is sketched only briefly, so the cost of their final commitment, while present, could be made even more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s vocation, reverence for history, and specific craft produce a vivid, particular consciousness under pressure. Motivation—to learn to navigate without moving—is clear and consistent, and micro-choices (tying on the arrowhead, refusing to rise, casting it away, leaving the stones) align with that drive. Internal conflict is subtle but present as tension between using tools (movement, instruments) and surrendering them to stillness. The only limit is that we never see a sharper personal cost or flaw beyond this vocational/spiritual quest, which keeps the arc slightly cool.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and particular, with a clear arc from “underachieving mage” to “patient caretaker of questions,” and the choice to refuse ownership of the keystone feels like an earned renunciation. Contradictory impulses—shame vs. curiosity, ambition vs. refusal of productization—are dramatized rather than labeled (“underachieving as a lid,” “mage as a fragile cup”). Emotional states are embodied in specific perceptions (cold ringing in teeth, doubts as moths) rather than abstractly named. The cost—choosing apprenticehood and service over status—is subtle but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lamplighter’s desire “to discover the color of sound” is specific, sustained, and consistently filters perception, and their occupational detail (late-shift, practiced at “leaving”) grounds them as more than a generic lyric “I.” Internal conflict is understated but present: a self-professed non-superstitious person seeking magic through vows and color, which pays off in the earned acceptance of a binding obligation. The final vow “to light the pier without tiring of attention” reads as an earned stasis, a deepened re-commitment rather than a volte-face. A hair more embodied, contradictory emotion under pressure—fear, reluctance, or temptation to retreat—would push this toward absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s role as “cast lots decision maker” is psychologically rich, with shame, duty, and awe in credible tension and an earned revaluation near the end. Their actions (coin flips, willingness to surrender control) track cleanly with that interior conflict. Sori is sketched economically but distinctly—her “quietly enthusiastic” tending and humming provide a clear relational counterpoint. The final acceptance of their role (“because causality ran uphill here”) feels motivated and costly rather than epiphanic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The reaper’s grief, guilt, and vocation interlock into a clear, specific motivation, and his choices (returning, listening, naming, accepting future failure) feel organically compelled. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the gentleness broke him like frost breaks a reed”) rather than labeled. The final stance—quiet commitment to ongoing, costly work rather than catharsis—reads as an earned renunciation. There’s slight distance from his irrational impulses in the peak beat, which keeps this just shy of truly devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Efan’s characterization is distinctive and coherent: “lukewarm,” steady, and “earnestly naive” in ways that directly shape his methods and endurance. His brittle devotion (“threatened to snap if tugged wrongly, so he cradled it with uncertain hands”) gives him a genuine fault line rather than pure competence. The fisherman functions as a low-key relational mirror, providing pressure through skepticism and hunger rather than melodrama. The main limit is that his internal contradiction (doubt vs. belief) stays mostly textural; it never quite forces a painful, on-page renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The warden’s interiority is specific and textured—his ritual of naming foundation stones, his reluctance to pocket keepsakes, and his memory of the mentor all feel idiosyncratic rather than generic. His contradiction between bureaucratic duty (“expunge hazards with a neutral hand”) and inherited obligation to remember drives the central choice to call the volunteers. The final stance—he will still “file reports and pin flags,” but refuse to expunge the story—reads as earned stasis with visible cost. A slightly clearer sense of his fear or risk regarding the bureau would deepen that cost and nudge characterization into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iri’s motivation—harmonizing logic and intuition, rooted in her grandmother’s teaching—is clear and consistently dramatized through choices like refusing to read the formulas and trusting the starlings. Internal conflict is present but quiet: she’s tempted by the security of the formulas yet chooses embodied wonder. Emotions are shown via tactile actions (cold bite of the crystal, tying the ribbon) rather than labels. The final renunciation of her formulas in favor of balance feels earned and carries a subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vigilance, guilt over the earlier failure, and need to re-earn the pilot’s trust are all richly embodied in sensory focus and micro-choices (lantern color, tapping codes, rope handling). Internal contradiction—deep competence versus persistent doubt—plays through the whole scene rather than being summarized. The relationship with the pilot is efficiently but powerfully etched, especially in the remembered wrist-catching and the final nod. The ending’s lighter “harness adjusted” relief feels earned by prior pressure and doesn’t erase the burden.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s numbness, duty as “recorder and the blade,” and eventual thaw are coherent and motivated, and Neri/Rae’s contrasting traits feel specific rather than token. Interiority is vivid and embodied through images (frost, teeth static) rather than label-speak. Internal conflict—wanting to stay numb vs. being moved by the training and the jar’s responses—plays out credibly. The main limitation is that Neri and Rae remain slightly emblematic; their own blind spots and costs are more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s motives and values are vividly particular—protecting “space for innovation” against commercial pressure, reverence for storms, and her listening relationship to the brook all feel lived-in. Her micro-choices (closing early, planting the seed, limiting admission, writing to the sender) consistently reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal conflict (meaning vs. profit, safety vs. experiment) is present but remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized under direct, on-page opposition. Still, the final stance—quietly committing to a low-profit, high-meaning design—reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conductor’s motivation and inner stance are vivid and consistent, with concrete embodied detail (“knuckles until they redden obediently,” kissing the pull cord for “luck and forgiveness”). His contradiction—“mournfully eager”—is dramatized rather than labeled, sustaining tension between hope and grief. Secondary figures (mother, children, Grief-as-man) are more emblematic than individuated, but that abstraction fits the fable-like mode. The final earned stasis—he leaves “a leader without applause, carrying home the repaired silence”—feels grounded in his prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s inner life is specific, paradoxical, and consistent: dimensionally homesick yet actively choosing to “make friends with uncertainty,” which gives their micro-choices real weight. The guardian is sharply etched through behavior and sensory detail (“all tenderness taught by wolves”) and her questions and tests apply direct pressure. The cost of belonging—offering breath to the bead, accepting waiting as binding—is clear and earned. Internal conflict remains mostly quiet and lyrical rather than dramatized in sharp contradictions, which keeps this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—to defy a prescribed ecclesiastical destiny by “vivifying” a forbidden possibility—is specific, consistent, and drives each micro-choice, from packing the crozier to stepping through the gate. Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic (“my hands do not tremble even while my heart hears everything”), with a credible blend of fear, reverence, and resolve rather than neat certainty. The core contradiction—stoic surface vs hypersensitive perception—shows in embodied choices like pressing his palm into the heat. The final renunciation (snapping and feeding the crozier into the fire) feels fully earned and visibly costly, closing off a life under the bishop’s “calculus.”

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation and interior logic are consistently clear—“fantasy practicality” as a worldview reads specific and drives all their choices. However, their emotional life remains a bit abstract; we get role and stance more than a rounded sense of personal history or contradiction beyond vocation. The grandmother and other presences function as vivid echoes rather than as pressures that complicate the narrator’s current values. The final acceptance of the engineer’s note as “my job description all along” feels earned but thematically neat rather than personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The deckhand’s motivation—to stop “losing arrivals” and make the ferry choose—emerges organically from his routine labor and liminal life aboard. His contradictory stance (ardent, resiliently positive yet weary of impermanence) culminates in the door choice, which feels earned. The relationship with the captain is sketched efficiently as a low-key crucible for his initiative. Emotional embodiment is mostly in perception rather than body, but it remains specific and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The architect’s motive—atoning for exploitative buildings and seeking “weak gravity between strangers”—is clear and specific, and the curator’s wary curiosity plays off him well. However, most emotion stays at the conceptual level; we get almost no embodied feeling beyond brief flashes (“anger erupt quietly”) so their inner contradictions under pressure remain soft. His guilt-debt is stated more than dramatized. The final stance shift toward “temporary allegiance” is earned but could land harder with more concrete emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s longing to navigate by absent starlight, professional duty, and quiet resistance to the city’s lamp-lit complacency create a specific, convincing psyche. Interiority is vivid and embodied through objects like the chain link and practices like night crawls. However, internal conflict rarely crystallizes into a pressured on-page choice; it stays mostly reflective rather than dramatized as competing impulses in a specific moment. The final pedagogical “You must listen to the edges” feels earned but not sharply costed.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s mix of duty, curiosity, and modesty is distinct and consistent, and his micro-choices (following the pulses on foot, engaging the man, gently steering both callers) all arise credibly from that nature. The man’s grief and the child’s tentative presence are sketched with minimal strokes yet feel particular, especially the detail of him keeping the hearing aid running at night. Internal contradiction is quiet but present—he frames himself as procedural yet repeatedly chooses “wasteful” care. The only limit is that his inner conflict is more implied than directly pressured on the page, so the final shift is resonant but not deeply reworked under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s fear/compulsion pairing (“claustrophobic spelunker…guided less by courage than by compulsion”) is sharp, embodied, and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (counting drips, measuring air seams with her lips) revealing priorities and limits. Her final renunciation—leaving the gold fleck and thus her “luck”—is fully earned by the prior guilt and need to be noticed, and carries visible emotional cost. The internal contradiction (terror of small spaces vs. drive to “track invisible things”) remains active throughout instead of resolving neatly. The only small gap is that her life beyond this mission remains relatively abstract, keeping the characterization just shy of maximal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s shame, stubbornness, and self-dramatizing guilt are embodied in concrete habits (counting heartbeats, carrying the shard) and choices (returning alone, asking the ghost how to “defragment what we broke”). Internal contradiction is active: they simultaneously seek “wisdom from failure” and cling to a fantasy of having “doomed the sky.” The final reframe—keeping the shard as “a lens cut small for carrying”—feels earned and forecloses the path of self-punishing melodrama. Relationships (with the digital echo and mentor) are mediated but real, applying pressure rather than serving as abstract voices.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storyteller’s motivation—to salvage a dying language by translating texture into sound—is specific, consistent, and carries through to the final renunciation of the travel-name. Interiority is oblique but vivid, embedded in methods rather than explicit feelings (“a curse is only a contract without punctuation, and I had learned to supply the pauses”). The cost of staying as caretaker and feeding the curse dead names reads as an Earned Stasis. The only ceiling is that we rarely see raw emotional contradiction; the character is more archetypal than psychologically conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives (undercover research, then the mission “to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke”) are clear and organically escalated into accepting the role of keeper. Interiority is vivid and particular (“Real notes rode in my bones…”), with professional focus (cryptid researcher) and personal need (laughter as cover) intertwined. The inner conflict—observer vs. participant, keeper vs. kept—is present but could be sharpened with one or two more concrete moments of hesitation or fear before saying yes. Still, the final acceptance reads earned and carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The violinist’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is specific and consistent, and her fear of the statues gives that motive credible friction. Interiority is vivid and embodied (heart rhythms, fingers on the bow) rather than abstract labels. The main limitation is that internal contradiction (terror vs compulsion, selfish vs collective motives) is hinted more than dramatized in a concrete, costly choice. Still, the final decision to keep playing under threat feels earned by prior beats and closes one path (obedient silence) with a real implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mailman’s interiority is rich and specific—his “respectfully rebellious” stance, attention to absences, and sense of duty versus regulation all feel grounded and consistent. His choice to stay with Mina and then to deliver the misrouted letter is credibly motivated by what we’ve seen of him. Old Mina, though brief on the page, is sharply drawn and exerts real pressure. The cost of his rebellion is more implied than dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The carpenter’s motivation—to interpret silence as possibility and restore the carousel—is clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially his decision to sing despite his habitual silence. Interior contradiction is subtle rather than overt, but his arc from pure listener to active resonator feels earned. Emotional states are conveyed more through attention and action than explicit feeling labels, which suits the piece. The main limitation is that his internal cost in breaking silence is mostly inferred, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian’s interiority is specific, textured, and motivated by the long-running desire “to find the place where stories live,” grounded in sensory anchors like the scarf and inherited beliefs from the mother. Her choices—to shelve by curvature, to step into the saddle of space, to pursue the path and then return—flow from a coherent mix of curiosity, duty, and quiet eccentricity. The change is subtle but earned: she shifts from naive pursuit of a place to a more mature acceptance of glimpsing only its “weather” while remaining responsible to patrons. The relationship pressure from the boy and woman is gentle but effective as a tether that constrains her urge to disappear entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to pursue but not possess the dream—is clear, consistent, and sharpened by the sea’s question about “what price I set on waking.” Interiority and worldview are rich and specific, but emotional conflict (urge to capture vs. ethic of escorting/letting go) is more implied than directly felt in the body. The final renunciation—opening the east door and not turning when the dream brushes their shoulder—reads as an earned stance rather than a surprise. I would only push higher if we felt a sharper, more contradictory pull in the moment of decision itself.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to free a long-suppressed idea bound up with the mother’s departure—is vivid, specific, and consistently dramatized. Interiority is rich and embodied (“fog trapped in a jar,” “behind my teeth like a prisoner”), and the contradiction between fear and desire is active on the page. The emotional shift from guarding loss to singing it as a beginning feels earned by prior beats. The locksmith is more archetypal than individuated, but that suits his role and doesn’t undercut the protagonist’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and particular, with concrete motives (to reclaim her grandmother’s memories, to redeem a professional obsession) that align cleanly with her actions. The conflict between scholarly drive and relational neglect crystallizes in the confession about “the woman who held my anchor rope,” which feels both specific and costly. Emotional states are embodied through tools and environment rather than labels alone. The final act of writing her grandmother’s name a third time reads as an earned, stubborn correction rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s motivation—guarding memory while practicing “reversible exile”—is clear, specific, and borne out in micro-choices (serving tea, uncorking dusk, pacing backwards). Internal contradiction between combative tenderness and anxiety is embodied rather than labeled. The child and council are sketched but function well as pressures that reveal facets of the archivist rather than as deep characters themselves. The closing endurance—remaining as guardian after exposure—reads as earned stasis with an intelligible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miren’s vocation and motivation—to preserve “the color of wonder”—are vivid, consistent, and embodied in her pruning and handling of the seed, and the child interaction reveals a gentle, credible relational side. However, she faces little genuine internal contradiction or risk; her competence is never seriously tested. The result is a beautifully etched figure whose depth is more archetypal than psychologically conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator’s motivation as a “broken mask restorer” hired to ground spirits is clear and consistent, and the caretaker provides a quiet relational counterpoint. However, interior conflict is muted; the narrator rarely feels torn or personally at risk, reading more as a practiced ritualist than a fully individuated psyche under pressure. The best moment of humanization is the near-fall and shared laughter, which hints at vulnerability but doesn’t fully reconfigure their inner stance. The closing acknowledgement of “never to banish, only to ground” lands, but as confirmation rather than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s characterization as a “perceptive map framer” with “shielded openness” and an oath to “interpret silence with empathy” is distinctive and consistent, and those traits clearly drive their investigative choices. Interiority is mostly embedded in metaphor and attention rather than explicit thought, but it still feels specific and embodied. The relationship with the verger has a subtle, believable dynamic—his shrug that “tried to be refusal and failed” is an excellent status beat. The arc is more of an earned endurance/stance (continuing to honor silence rather than sensationalizing it) than a sharp change, which slightly limits the sense of internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation (to listen, catalog, and “understand the physics of letting go”) is clear and consistent, and their professional, death-familiar temperament feels specific. Interiority is textured and embodied (“my hand wanted to round every letter as if smoothing a child's hair in a storm”). However, internal contradiction is relatively muted; there’s less sense of live push–pull beyond a quiet desire to stay versus the practical need to surface. The final choice—to take the snow globe and leave—is credible but more a gentle inflection than a hard, costly turn in character.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The balladeer’s motivation—translating hidden needs—is specific and consistent, and their shift from once-loud performer to patient conduit is convincingly sketched (“Now, seldom-heard, I had patience for echo and for the corners where voices hide”). Interiority is embodied through tools and sensations rather than labels, and their small, precise choices (bolting the plate on, waiting for the next flash) feel character-driven. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: desire to be heard vs. willingness to efface the self as “hinge,” which fits the piece’s scale. The main limitation is that the emotional cost of this self-effacement is gestured at more than pressed on, so the change reads resonant but slightly under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive (“to seek out the joy beneath anguish”) is clear and consistently expressed through concrete micro-choices—soothing the elevator, angling goggles, arranging letters “curious without trespass.” The tension between assignment vs gentler motive, and between mythic awe vs practical caretaking, gives them a distinctive interior texture. However, the internal conflict never quite sharpens into a genuinely costly dilemma; the emotional price of taking on others’ grief remains largely implied. A touch more dramatized friction or visible strain at the end would deepen the sense of an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and coherent: a technically trained meteorologist whose grief-driven belief in “empty spaces remember” colors every perception. Motivation (to prove her theory and memorialize her father) is clearly rooted in backstory and expressed through concrete micro-choices (categorizing clouds by emotion, threading “coordinates through feeling”). Internal contradiction—dutiful professional vs. idiosyncratic, emotional reader of weather—is present but could be pushed harder under peak pressure. The final stance (using her emotional taxonomy to guide them home and log the night) feels earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (to capture sky, to test limits, to honor the tree) are concrete and consistent, and prosopagnosia is meaningfully embodied in how they read grain, shelves, and clouds. Micro-choices—probing the coin, persisting in the search, bargaining implicitly for “one more minute,” and deciding to hide the letter—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: fear of time and collapse versus a near-trance commitment to finish the mural. The final endurance stance (“together we made a sky that could survive the fall”) feels earned and carries visible cost (risking being inside at demolition, accepting the building’s loss).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The apprentice’s curiosity, observational bent, and modest ambition are rendered with particular, embodied detail (sleeping under charts, compass dust on cheek, annotating the kettle lid). Motivation is clear and consistent: to understand patterns, prove their value, and remain useful aboard. Internal conflict is quiet rather than sharp—more a tension between deference and initiative than a true clash of impulses—which slightly softens the dramatic charge of choices. Still, the hopscotch decoding and request to the helmsman feel well-earned by prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s motivation and sensibility are vivid and specific—his “driftwood nostalgia” and training shape how he approaches every object. His micro-choices (softening his gloves, listening for “questions in the ticking,” deciding what to leave behind) feel consistent and grounded. Internal contradiction is subtler: the tension between tool-based fixing and learned listening is present but never quite sharpened into a truly pressured dilemma. The closing realization that “the library had repaired him as much as he had repaired it” feels earned, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The collective “we” voice gives the group a clear emotional arc—skeptical, fearful, then willing to trust and move—but it inevitably softens individual specificity. Lio’s motivation (to care for and organize the living) is consistent and dramatized through the bell, chalk, and the rescue. Internal conflict is sketched rather than delved into: “hope here is brambled” is evocative but stays at the communal-abstract level. The final decision to launch toward the nebula feels earned but would land even harder with one or two sharper, individuated flashes of doubt or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “vouchsafe the world a few more unbroken heartbeats”—is clear, coherent, and escalates naturally into the final choice to sing into the machine. Interiority is textured and specific (“Bruised awe lived under my ribs”), with a believable mix of duty, fatigue, and wonder. Contradictions (legend vs janitor, not a hero vs bearing global responsibility) give them complexity without grandstanding. The final Earned Stasis—accepting the role as “only a caretaker of a delicate delay”—is well earned and carries cost.

    The caretaker-narrator is sharply etched: reluctant, bound by a curse he accepted in grief, and now enacting a weary, exacting competence. His motivation to guide travelers is clear and consistent, and his small, precise choices (how he steps, what he tells the boy about the nut) reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction—wanting to leave yet obeying the orchard—is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in direct inner conflict. The endurance at the end (“I returned to the rows…”) reads as an earned stasis with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in the chemist’s technical lens and grief, with guilt over the failed packaging driving every perception. Her contradictory impulses—atonement versus avoidance of lab/courtroom—are present and resolved in the decision to return with a concrete plan despite lawsuits and scorn. The choice to carry the chrysalis into every meeting, and to risk professional and relational backlash, feels fully earned by prior reflection. The only slight limit is that the sister remains entirely off-page, so that relationship’s emotional cost is inferred rather than directly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to find where stories begin while running a “clean slate” shop—is clear, character-specific, and consistently embodied in their choices (following the map, entering the vellum door, offering their ledger and “unfinishedness”). Interiority is vivid and particular, with perceptions like “fog had tried to learn manners” revealing sensibility rather than stock emotion. The internal conflict (merchant vs. clerk of a metaphysical court) is more implied than dramatized, so the cost of their final offering, while present, is still relatively gentle. A stronger sense of risk or reluctance around surrendering their ledger/regrets would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The chef’s motivation—to temper rather than erase pain—is clear and consistently embodied in how he approaches the pavilion and the keeper. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“mouth full of borrowed thunder,” jaw aching “like old rope”), and his micro-choices under pressure (letting the filament touch, deciding to cook from the coral) feel earned. The keeper is sketched efficiently yet with enough weight that his remorse and change at dinner register. Internal contradiction is relatively subtle (he’s cautious yet willingly exposes himself), which keeps this just short of the most complex character work.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motives and methods are vivid and consistent—“People arrive alone and leave separate... my job is to braid them”—and her occupational texture as a choral librarian is beautifully specific. However, she encounters little on-page resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or a real emotional cost to her bridge-building. Her “empathetically decisive” nature reads more as an unalloyed strength than a trait that forces hard trade-offs. The communal cast is sketched effectively but without individuated pressure back on her.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s helix-minded, “chaotically precise” worldview is distinctive and consistently expressed in perception and method, and the emotional throughline—fear of drowning in memory versus desire to excavate it—is clear. Internal change from anxious, grasping seeker to “patient recorder of abandoned dreams” reads earned, especially around the mirror’s final shattering. The main weakness is a relative abstraction of personal stakes: the colleague and the broader social collapse are evocative but lightly sketched, so the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally lived-in. Still, the interiority is specific and integrated with action, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    The archivist’s motivation—to seek “forgotten combinations” and reconfigure how the city’s locks relate to grief and vigilance—is clear and consistently dramatized. Interiority is specific and embodied through image (“latent blaze under wet canvas,” “safes reopened in my ribs”), and choices under pressure (which crown to accept, how many safes to open, when to leave) feel rooted in that psyche. The internal conflict between the desire to act overtly and a principled commitment to latent, patient influence is present but could surface more overtly as a live contradiction in a peak beat. The final Earned Stasis—choosing silence and latent blaze over proclamation—feels earned and carries a credible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sculptor’s motivation (“I came here to create music in a silent world”) is clear and consistent, and their sensitivity and “empathy in motion” are convincingly embodied in choices (taking the insulator, surrendering cleverness, choosing pulse over symphony). Internal movement from wanting a grand symphony to offering a humble heartbeat reads as a credible, if quiet, arc. What’s missing at the very top tier is any sharper contradiction or personal cost beyond aesthetics; we don’t glimpse flaws or stakes in their life beyond this grove. The result is deeply felt but somewhat idealized characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s exile, guilt, and vocation are specific and coherent, and his motives (to understand how “difficult beauty survives”) drive each choice with credible restraint. The girl’s silence and precision read as a real counter-presence; she exerts pressure through tapping, tracing moves, and ultimately delivering the “check I could not parry.” Internal conflict is subtle but present: his mixed fear/acceptance about judgment, his urge to repair vs. his stated intent merely to learn. The final willingness to face the family, whether to stay or accept renewed exile, feels earned and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s ethics, vocation, and inheritance from Anya cohere into a specific, memorable person whose choices (no prying, sound-based opening) arise cleanly from being an “eclectic pacifist.” The internal tension between wanting truth and refusing harm is implicit rather than dramatized in overt struggle, but it underlies every tactic. Emotional beats—anticipation, reverence, grief-tinged resolve—are embodied in actions like delaying opening the diary and speaking to the neighbors’ silence. The closing choice to sign with both names feels earned as an acceptance of burden rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s ambition (“a restless root seeking stone”) and sensory curse create a distinct, consistent psyche whose choice to plant the corpse flower is fully motivated. Interiority is specific and embodied through scent and motion rather than generic feelings. Internal conflict (ambition vs. communal fear, attraction to rot vs. disgust) could surface more sharply in the planting moment, which now feels a bit too serene. The final softening into stewardship is earned, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s desire and vocational identity are clear and specific—“intrepid orchard pilot” with a family bequest and promise to fulfill—so her core motivation reads strong and consistent. Interiority is vivid in sensory terms but relatively simple emotionally; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond fear vs duty, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. The key choices (following the ribbon, touching metal to resin, planting the fused heart) are well motivated and aligned with the established values of care and curiosity. The final endurance—choosing ongoing practice over trophy—is earned but carries a quiet rather than sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The investigator’s competence, ethical stance, and relationship to the mentor/patch are sharply etched and consistent, and the brief interaction with the child is economical but affecting. Motivation (foresight in action) is clear and enacted through micro-choices like offsetting the landing zone and refusing to treat the landing as victory. Internal contradiction is relatively subtle—this is mostly a figure of poise rather than someone visibly torn—so the emotional cost at the end reads as intellectual and professional more than visceral. That keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell ringer has a clear, idiosyncratic motivation (“to certify wonder as essential”) and a distinct perceptual world, and the one beat of doubt about the city of noise gives a flicker of internal conflict. However, their inner life remains more emblematic than personal; the piece rarely grounds their stakes in embodied feeling beyond vocation-as-prayer. The sculptor functions almost entirely as an extension of the ritual rather than as a full character. The final endurance/fulfillment of their mission is conceptually earned but emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—returning as a disgraced guardian to understand the breach—is vivid and consistent, and his micro-choices with the flute and driftwood under pressure feel rooted in that wound. Interiority is textured and specific (“they call me a driven relic keeper, but the title fits like a scar”), with credible guilt rather than neat self-forgiveness. The final shift in technique (loosening the weave, accepting slower, humbler methods) is earned by the ledger-like self-indictment in the middle. A slightly clearer embodiment of his emotional state in the climax (beyond metaphor) could deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The operator’s motivation (“to understand the mathematics of emotion”) is specific, persistent, and clearly linked to her actions with the couple, the halo fragment, and her own confession. Interiority is rich and particular, especially the tension between using ambiguity as self-protection versus as a tool to “disorient fear.” The habit of borrowing personalities (especially Maris) creates a credible internal conflict around courage and authenticity. The final admission about misusing ambiguity feels earned by prior beats and forecloses a prior mode of self-avoidance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courier’s jitteriness versus his learned stillness, plus his unresolved grief for the mentor, generate a believable inner friction that colors every choice. His micro-choices—accepting this job, inviting the widow to breathe into his hands, holding the pitch despite his own ache—track cleanly to the final stance of “courier or gardener.” The widow is sketched with minimal yet effective strokes (“face already half bright and half memory”), and her acceptance of the miracle’s limits feels earned. The only thing keeping this from an even higher band is that her interiority remains more emblematic than individuated, by design but still a limit.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mystic’s interiority is specific and credible, and Mara’s arc from amused skepticism to shaken belief is cleanly motivated by on-page events. The narrator’s mix of modesty and quiet conviction (“attention is a candle in windy places”) grounds their choices and gives them a distinct psychology. The relationship functions as a crucible: Mara’s resistance forces the mystic to demonstrate their practice in a way that costs both of them emotionally. The only limiter is that we glimpse relatively little active inner contradiction in the mystic; their stance remains steady rather than meaningfully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kio’s longing and purpose are clear and consistent, and the act of “thinning herself” to send the message reads as a quiet but real sacrifice. Her interiority is expressed through concrete, idiosyncratic perceptions (cicadas refusing their chorus, cloth thinking) rather than labels. The bond with her brother, though mostly offstage, feels specific enough to justify her devotion. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—she is both wistful and resolute—rather than dramatized as active, competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iven’s motivation is lucid and consistent—“Deliberate, not quick, not grand, simply exact”—and his choices (risking his breath, trading memories) grow naturally from that. His meekness and quiet determination are dramatized rather than told, especially in walking into the storm while others flee. The cost of his stance (bruised wrist, exhaustion, thin dreams) lands. The only shortfall at this level is a relative lack of on-page inner contradiction; he borders on wholly virtuous.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—her identity as a sensory map maker, her relationship to smell, and her complicated feelings toward her mother all feel individualized and grounded in concrete perceptions. The reveal that she herself pressed REDIRECT is well-motivated and reconfigures her self-concept in a way that’s earned by prior beats (“obedient to a pattern that moved me like tide”). The moral stance at the end (neither forgiving nor blaming the child-self) preserves genuine ambiguity rather than smoothing it away. The only minor gap is that we don’t see more immediate, irrational resistance or self-deception at the moment of recognition, which could deepen her internal contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The keeper’s motive—protecting a fragile sense of safety for strangers—is specific, consistent, and dramatized through micro-choices (keeping the bunk story, tending the letter chain, building stone messages). Her emotional life is embodied in concrete perceptions (lamp, birds, sea glass) rather than labels. The skipper’s reticence plays well in contrast, giving the relationship a quiet charge without overstatement. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; she aches with loneliness yet insists she is “just the last person who said yes,” which could support even sharper on-page tension under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s vocation, melancholy, and wry joy are clearly motivated (“I came because shadows still knew how to speak here”), and their choices—to accept the tower, to collaborate with the storm, to adopt and train the child—flow coherently from that stance. Interiority is textured and particular, not generic, and the relationship with both storm and child gives us a live crucible for values (truth vs. comfort, past vs. future). Internal contradiction is present but relatively low-key—this is more an earned stasis than a major inner reversal. The endurance at the end (“emerald vow to tomorrow”) feels paid for, but the cost is conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in a single pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s sensibility is vivid and specific—“watchful dye master with a borrowed pulse” is a defining lens—and their motive to understand story-magnetism is clear and sustained. Interiority is well-embodied through attention to light, cloth, and the donor heart’s “lean,” rather than abstract labels. However, internal conflict remains relatively gentle; we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses under real pressure so much as a steady refinement of perception. The closing stance feels earned but low-cost, more evolution than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent—lonely, methodical, wryly self-aware—anchored in the maintenance-worker identity and grief. Micro-choices (keeping the sextant, committing to the “quantified sorrow” experiment despite embarrassment, pressing the sextant to the root, excavating the wall, choosing to read and log the tags) flow naturally from those traits. The internal conflict is quiet but present: embarrassment vs. compulsion to measure, repair vs. witness, fear of grief vs. attraction to it. The change by the end—grief made measurable and shareable, the narrator finally “hearing” trees—is subtle but earned, with a felt cost in being flooded by accumulated sorrow that nonetheless “floats.”

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s identity as a “scattered memory keeper” with seams that “never fully held” gives a specific, embodied flaw that the ritual work then tests. Motivation (rekindling a realm, knitting communities) is clear and consistent, and the internal contradiction—deeply communal role vs. fragile self-cohesion—registers in lines like “my courage fluttered like burlap.” The closing image of scattered selves “gather[ing] like swallows” is an earned reconfiguration rather than an unearned epiphany. Slight deduction because most conflict is processed through lyrical description and ritual rather than concrete, pressured micro-choices moment to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with the narrator’s blend of compassion and avoidance consistently motivating choices (“I went because staying while leaving had been my undoing…”). The internal contradiction—yearning to help versus fear of harming—plays out credibly in both backstory and present encounter. The relationship with the friend functions as a crucible where both characters’ motives are unpacked without easy moral sorting. The final refusal to “reconcile into old shapes” feels like earned stasis with a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific, embodied, and morally knotted; they’re both complicit and resistant, which makes choices like carrying the last loaf and tending the courtyard feel earned. The self-described “creeping normality noticer” is dramatized through micro-choices (bread as devotional, gentle clearing, feeding ants and roots) rather than mere label. The cashier’s arrival adds a relational crucible that tests guilt versus care, especially when they laugh about lines “as if lines themselves could hold a building together.” The closing decision to keep returning, “still refusing the lazy gravity of forgetting,” is an earned endurance with visible cost rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s meticulous temperament, devotion to order, and quiet awe are consistently embodied in action—steadying the lantern, measuring light, writing the final clause. Motivation (to keep meaning alive against oblivion) is clear and earned through the work they’ve been doing all along. The shift from “orderly records chief” to self-aware “guardian of resonances” feels organic and consequential. Internal conflict is present but underplayed; the decision to sacrifice self into the archive could benefit from one sharper beat of hesitation or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lark’s motive (collecting “human weather”) and her training by her father create a distinctive, consistent psychology, and her micro-choices—especially manipulating trades and choosing to thwart the cutpurse—align cleanly with that. Her flaw/ambiguity (ethically engineering a betrayal for the sake of a recording) is present but could be explored one degree more sharply in on-page interior contradiction. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently through behavior and status without feeling stock. The final endurance—carrying the captured “brittle inhale” away—reads as an earned stasis with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation (to understand weather-carriers) is clear and consistent, and their skepticism versus receptivity plays through in concrete questions and sensory attention. The shift from doubter to someone who agrees to “carry your story” is a real, earned change, though the emotional cost of that shift could be embodied a bit more. Interiority is specific and character-particular (taste-as-orientation, “history had turned into circuitry”), not generic. The relationship with Mirelle has a clear status and function but could show a touch more interpersonal friction to feel fully crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and plausibly conflicted: a working artist who both depends on “quick smiles to tourists” and feels tugged toward a deeper, riskier calling. Motivation is clear and consistent—from memory hoarding to the desire to “rectify the theft of my younger courage”—and micro-choices (returning to the cave, touching the dial, deciding to bring the pages upstairs) reveal values under pressure. The grief over Vera, economic compromise, and loyalty to her vision create a credible tangle rather than a neat epiphany. The final stance—continuing to sell portraits while opening the cave’s work to the world—reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a wishful reset.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a near-physiological aversion to dishonesty coupled with complicity in a system that redirects truth. Her shift from artisan to organizer—refusing to gild, then boycotting, then demanding collective opening—feels earned and rooted in that flaw. The postmaster’s “mercy” rationale and late, small candor give their dynamic real moral grain without cartoon villainy. A slight gap is that we don’t see more of her personal risk or prior compromises, which could deepen the cost of her stand.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iri’s motives (guarding wonder via sound) are clear and consistent, and her choices around the shard feel grounded in that ethos. The Keepers’ fears are sketched with just enough specificity (“palms…inked with alphabets like bruises”) to give them credible motivation. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—her tension between sharing and protecting wonder never quite breaks into a sharp on-page struggle. The final cost (trembling gloved fingers, guarding delight) lands, but a touch more embodied conflict in the moment of possible loss would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The android’s motivation—resolve “inner static” through tending and then through risk—is specific and consistent, and their choices (opening the tin, designing the rudder-shape, miniaturizing the burn) clearly arise from that core. Interiority is vivid and embodied via mechanical metaphors (“a rib of code had unlatched to let weather through”) rather than abstract labels. The inner conflict between system-imposed endless balance and a need for finite, gestural intervention is well dramatized. The final reorientation of purpose (not just plants but fear itself as charge) feels earned and carries cost in risk and self-redefinition.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motive—to prove that listening heals and to steward the community’s stories—is specific and consistent, and their micro-choices (hosting the gathering, choosing the locket, inviting the film crew into the hush) feel rooted in that identity. Interiority is implied more through metaphor and curation than explicit self-contradiction, but there is a credible tension between scarcity (“coffers are thin”) and generosity. Secondary characters are sketched in clean, economical strokes that avoid stereotype while still feeling archetypal. The one limitation is that the narrator trends toward idealized and almost flawlessly self-aware, so visible flaws or missteps under pressure are muted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motive (liberating the drowned names) is clear and consistent, and Mara’s “calm defiance” plus her kinetic intelligence read as particular and compelling. Interiority is mostly implied through image and action (“cataloging my fear in careful lines”) rather than deep contradictory impulses on the page, so internal conflict stays relatively muted. The relationship dynamic—Mara leading through dance, the narrator translating—feels specific and charged. The closing beat, where a touch conveys the needed pattern, pays off their partnership without quite forcing a visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s grief, vocation, and curiosity are specific and consistent, and their choices (seeking the chemist, returning to the whale, following the corridor, sealing the memory) grow organically from that drive. Interiority is vivid and embodied through image rather than labels, and the relationship with the sister feels textured despite her off-page status. Internal conflict is quieter—there’s less explicit contradiction than a steady ache—but the push–pull between acceptance and retrieval is there. The final understanding of what their “work really keeps” feels earned by prior behavior rather than bestowed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The summoner’s motivation—to “hush a prophecy spoken in code” via listening rather than force—is clear, consistent, and particular. Interiority is implied through perception and choices rather than spelled out, but we do get a credible ethic (“I do not erase; I release what was trapped in noise”) that informs every action. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of fear or doubt despite the task being “simple and impossible”—which keeps this just below the very top tier. The relationship with the fox is atmospheric rather than a crucible, so pressure remains essentially solitary and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—“a stubborn wish to learn the language of old buildings”—is specific, consistent, and drives every interaction, and the tutor’s oblique replies feel psychologically coherent. The relationship dynamic is clear and textured, with status subtly shifting as the narrator moves from borrower to inheritor. Internal conflict is present but understated, mostly crystallizing around whether to “interrogate” him and accept the seal. The ending choice to take the seal and accept the ethical charge feels earned, though the emotional cost could be embodied a touch more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and particular, with a coherent drive (“translate isolation into independence”) that informs every choice, especially the negotiation with the quarantined memory. The internal conflict—skepticism versus a willingness to carry sorrow—plays out credibly in the decision to accept the child’s winter. Emotions are embodied through highly specific metaphors (winter in the chest, library of frost) rather than labels. The closing stance as a “quiet archive” feels earned by prior doubt and negotiation, not handed down as a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motives and contradictions—traitor vs. precise merciful forger, anger at exile vs. loyalty to the mentor—are specific and coherent. Micro-choices (opening the case, choosing not to “complete” the treatise, planting the thorn) all reveal a hierarchy of values. Emotional texture is embodied through tactile images (wrists, ink, blood) rather than labels. The only limitation is that the mentor and city remain largely conceptual pressures rather than dynamically dramatized relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s motivation—to understand why some people echo and whether they themself are a “rope-cutter or a knot-maker”—is vivid, specific, and drives every choice. Interiority is rich and particular (“where ribs meet and carry a small river of feeling”), and the past with the mother adds credible ache without melodrama. The internal conflict between wandering detachment and responsibility comes to a clear but not saccharine shift in the closing promise. If anything, the emotional struggle feels slightly too frictionless, with little real resistance to the final self-revaluation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethics, and competence are vividly particular (“I am the kind of guide who weaves truth carefully”), and their choices—diving, decoding, staging a communal revelation—track cleanly with that nature. Emotional life is more implied than directly conflicted; we see care and restraint but little on-page struggle or contradiction beyond the principled refusal to “shout.” Secondary figures are sketched efficiently through specific details (the harbor pilot’s son, Sofia’s husband) but don’t exert much individualized pressure. The ending’s quiet endurance—holding space rather than grandly accusing—feels earned and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to honor hidden labor—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice from holding a silent demonstration to gifting the whisk to the child. Interiority is vivid and embodied through attention to tools and textures rather than abstract feelings. The councilor’s shift from skepticism to participation gives a small but credible relational arc. The main limitation is that internal conflict is minimal; the narrator rarely feels genuinely torn, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation, habits, and values are sharply etched, and their motivation—to replace superstition with mechanism—is consistent and drives every choice. Interiority is specific (“I did not intuit magic; I intuited design”) and grounded in concrete actions like camping in the office and reassembling letters. The final renunciation of the diamond is earned and carries a quiet cost (leaving with less material gain but a changed stance). What’s missing for a higher score is a stronger sense of internal contradiction under pressure; the narrator rarely feels genuinely torn.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motives (“a project and a sin,” allegiance to storms) are vivid and consistent, and Brin’s hunger-based pragmatism plays nicely against them. However, internal contradiction and real hesitation are mostly gestured at rather than dramatized; once Brin arrives, everyone tends to move in thematic harmony with little friction. The “sin” of the project never forces a painful on-page choice. Relationships are interesting but don’t quite become crucibles that demand sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s characterization as a “vagrant penny poet” with jars of weather is vivid and internally coherent, and his core motive—to translate between generations—credibly drives his choices. His emotional life is embodied more through perception than explicit feeling, but that perception is so idiosyncratic it effectively stands in for interiority. The final renunciation (“only until the village learned to cup its own palms”) feels earned by everything we’ve seen him do. What keeps this just shy of the very top tier is the relative gentleness of his internal contradictions; we don’t see much in-scene friction between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marek’s “logically emotional” nature is dramatized in his choice to eschew force, study the stone, and risk offering the key, and the seeker’s backstory gives her hunger credible shading. The relationship dynamic shifts from potential antagonism to uneasy partnership in a way that feels earned. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper sense of Marek’s genuine blind spots or capacity for error under pressure; he’s almost preternaturally calibrated. The final choice carries cost but not deep contradiction or lasting damage.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “sculpt patience from impatience” and serve as horizon mapper—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in their choices (accepting the viaduct task, how they answer the girl, and how they direct the men). The internal conflict between rage/urgency and patience is present but largely expressed through aphoristic reflection rather than dramatized moments under sharper pressure. The girl and the village men function well as pressures and foils, though they remain sketched more symbolically than individually. The final stance (teaching inside the sanctuary) feels earned and character-rooted, even if the cost of that stance could be made more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The investigator’s interiority is specific and pressured, with the “watchfully calm” self-image believably fraying (“the assignment sheet trembled in my hand”) yet holding enough to function. Her conflict between following the algorithm’s preferred narrative and honoring the workers’ deaths culminates in clear, motivated choices: turning off the radios, rejecting “easy drownings,” and writing “preventable, collective, and mine to report upward.” The lantern-triggered overlay of her father’s death with the workers’ is a strong, concrete driver of that shift rather than a generic epiphany. The only small limitation is that the supervisor relationship remains offstage, so that crucible is more thematic than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chaplain is sharply drawn through vocation-specific perception and choices, and the proprietor feels particular rather than archetypal. Motivation—helping Jonah translate apology into action—is clear and consistent, with a subtle internal conflict between doctrine and lived repair. Jonah’s characterization is strong but mostly mediated through the chaplain’s recollection; we lose some potential immediacy of his inner knots. The final stance—asking Jonah to choose small, deserved steps—feels earned, though a slightly deeper glimpse of the chaplain’s own doubt under pressure could sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilex’s motivation (“to ring a bell no one hears yet”) is vivid and consistent, and his irreverent/awe-struck temperament feels specific rather than generic. His methods and jokes (“the code wanted a hug”) reveal character under pressure in a way that’s earned. Internal contradiction (irreverence vs almost-religious devotion to the project) is present but could be pushed harder into a true dilemma or cost. The emotional cost is mostly implied through fatigue and the denied tears rather than dramatized as a real trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motives—professional duty, obsession with absence, and identification with Aida—are clear and drive each step from noticing the numbers to breaking rules. The internal conflict between policy/compliance and honoring Aida’s voice culminates credibly in the final choice. Emotional life is mostly carried via strong images rather than nuanced, moment-by-moment feeling, so the cost of the choice stays a bit abstract. Still, the character reads particular and non-generic, especially through metaphors tied to archiving and deletion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation (“map empathy onto action”) is clear and consistently embodied in her choices: going to the mirrors instead of declaring a verdict, proposing shared watches, deciding to stay a season. Interiority is specific and textured, with concrete self-conception (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “patience made a method”) rather than label-speak. Internal conflict is relatively quiet—there’s tension between demanded verdict and chosen process, but little sense of genuine temptation to do otherwise, which slightly softens the felt cost. Matilde and Harun function more as articulated positions than fully individuated people, though they do exert credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and contradiction-driven: a former euthanasia tourist now obsessed with listening for “approaching endings” while still keeping their own appointment on the calendar. Micro-choices under pressure (moving before panic to save the child; repeatedly delaying the clinic call) clearly reveal a value hierarchy shifting from self-erasure to attunement and stewardship. Emotions are embodied and idiosyncratic — “windborne solace brushing ribs from within,” “eyes dilated like moons under ice” — rather than generic labels. The final renunciation (asking for another delay) feels fully earned by prior beats and carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both characters emerge as specific and conflicted: the sentinel’s patience and history with storms ground his role, while the traveler’s split between love and self-direction (“She nods to the first and cannot to the second”) is sharply drawn. Motivation for every key choice—staying, talking, rewriting the letter—is clear and consistent. The internal conflict is lived rather than explained, especially in her inability to voice her river/row preference without apology. The change at the end—her conditional, self-honoring offer—is credibly earned with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation and role are clear and particular (“My task is to preserve the echo of wisdom, not the blare of it”), and the narrator’s micro-choices under pressure (guiding the walker, asking how to widen the clearing, choosing to trust the margin) are coherent and grounded. The walker and prophet feel vivid through behavior and ritual rather than exposition. However, internal contradiction in the narrator remains relatively understated; the piece leans more on devotion than on felt ambivalence or moral friction, which modestly limits depth at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s vocation and temperament are sharply realized, and details like “subtle puzzle archivist” and the calm hands “giving their nerves a rhythm to borrow” ground her as a particular, not generic, healer. Her motivation—to chart grief into a walkable map—is coherent and drives every choice. Internal contradiction is present but quiet (calm vs tremble), fitting the piece’s lyric register. The mayor and townspeople are sketched efficiently as a chorus rather than individuated characters, which slightly limits relational complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scholar’s motivation—to decode “the pattern of growth” after the last dictionary—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his meticulous listening and card-arranging. His reticence versus his duty to “testify” gives him a quiet but real internal tension, especially in “He hates to speak, but he loves to hear.” The progression toward becoming “briefly fluent, a careful instrument played by the room” feels earned, though his conflicts stay mostly conceptual rather than messily emotional. A bit more on-page contradiction or cost in his choice to carry the crystal to the printers could deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prophet’s motive—to “capture the sound of growing older” and to orient his future self in time—is clear, specific, and drives his choices (chalk-circling, arranging driftwood, kneeling at the toppled head). The precognitive forgetfulness is a genuine flaw that constrains him and forces compensatory rituals. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, though it lives more in metaphoric cognition than in embodied sensation, which slightly mutes visceral emotional impact. The ending’s acceptance—resetting markers for the man who won’t recognize them—reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply etched as a patient, quasi-mystical technician whose competence and worldview are revealed through how they treat instruments (“Cameras are small cities, and a wise mayor listens…”). Motivation—to “harness the ephemeral”—is consistent and drives all micro-choices, from coaxing capacitors to rebalancing mirrors. The internal conflict between scientific uncertainty and the director’s demand for certainty is quiet but present and resolves in an earned, modest stance shift (“I promised nothing…” / “we would unlearn the idea that the Moon owed us silence”). Emotional embodiment is mostly through attention to tools and environment rather than explicit feelings, but it remains character-specific and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    All three central figures feel distinct, with the narrator’s practiced gentleness, the father’s wry fatalism (“Record shards are sharp… like memory when you press the edge too hard”), and the son’s tentative return each grounded in specific speech and gesture. The therapist’s decision to call the son underpins the entire emotional arc and aligns with her stated professional and personal stance. Internal conflict is subtle but present in her commitment to a “flawless goodbye” versus the messiness of estrangement and grief. The relational shift—father and son moving from estranged to physically and emotionally present at death—lands as an earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s curiosity and “quietly deliberate” nature are clear and consistently expressed through her precise ritual acts and observational focus. Motivation holds from the first mention of wanting to know “whether shadows remembered anything at all” through to the contract scene. Internal conflict, however, remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see much embodied hesitation or cost around signing the contract or altering the island’s state. The resulting arc feels authentic but slightly cool, limiting emotional depth at the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is rich and internally consistent: the narrator’s “forgiving skeptic” stance manifests in concrete choices (pocketing the tooth, treating Ari, deciding to “tell it plain”). Ari’s shame and grief emerge through physical detail (the wrong arm, the map of mistakes) rather than labels, and Linnet’s grass-kneed shrewdness feels particular. The internal conflict—duty to truth vs mercy—plays out credibly in the decision to protect Ari while refusing the town’s witch/river stories. The only slight limit is that the narrator’s emotional cost in defying the town is implied more than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and specific—this narrator’s mix of patience, grief, and quiet devotion is well dramatized through tactile choices (polishing, stringing, climbing). Motivation (“to share light without using fire”) is clear and rooted in backstory with her brother and the burned village. Internal conflict (loyalty to her brother’s quest vs her own earthbound path) is present but stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in live contradictory impulses. The final stance—embracing patient, ground-bound light—reads earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than sharply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied (“a Geiger counter under my ribs”), with clear but conflicting impulses: hurt, protectiveness, and a genuine desire to reconfigure the relationship. Her choice to be “quietly proactive” rather than answer online, and later to offer the pendant and set the terms (“I am not an arena”), feels fully motivated and costly. The other woman’s motives—spectacle, remorse, boundary confusion—are legible without over-explanation, and their negotiation of permission around the pendant is an excellent relationship crucible. The only small limiter is that we don’t see deeper irrational spikes or messiness under peak pressure; both remain slightly too composed for the level of rupture implied.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflicted novelist’s motive (resisting the market to find the “original pulse” of their story) is clear, sustained, and culminates in the explicit choice of river over ladder. Interiority is specific and textured—“I realized I had been resisting only habit, not mandate” is a clean, earned reframing. The change is credible and rooted in prior beats, but we never see a concrete personal cost or flaw beyond abstraction; no relationship or tangible sacrifice sharpens the renunciation. The character feels vivid as a sensibility, slightly less so as a fully embodied life under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rowen’s motivation—to restore sacred practices—and the narrator’s arc from doubt to trust are clear and embodied in specific sensory responses (“corners of my doubts softened like bread meeting a warm palm”). Internal contradiction is mild rather than pressured; the narrator’s resistance is more a soft skepticism than a live competing impulse that complicates choices. Rowen himself borders on emblematic: his whimsy and wisdom are vivid but seldom strained or tested, which slightly flattens his complexity. The final change—collective re-adoption of the rites—feels earned, though the emotional cost is more implied than dramatized in any single hard decision.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to translate heartbeats into maps and lead people out of stasis—reads clear and consistent, and his grief-tinted patience gives him specificity. Interiority is mostly carried through ritualized action and sensory perception rather than explicit thought, which works but keeps internal contradiction on the subtle side. The sister memory is an effective, concise humanizing beat that reweights his patience. The final choice to spend starlight and intervene at the fissure feels earned by his prior listening and care.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The locksmith’s motivation—repairing his mentor’s timer and “storing wonder in the cellar of reason”—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through his methods and patience. His craft-based interiority feels particular (the way he “listened to its wrongness,” the analogy between locks and agreements), though his emotional life beyond vocation and quiet reverence stays relatively underexplored. The main change is subtle but legible: he shifts from extraction/collection toward a more ethical custodianship, leaving the timer behind and refusing ownership of wonder. A touch more dramatized contradiction or risk in his choices could push this into truly outstanding characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motive—to learn the “weights of different burdens”—is clear and consistently pressures their choices, and the late reveal of their fear (“that love would demand my departure”) retrofits earlier restraint with real complexity. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic, with embodied responses (“saltshaken hand,” trembling while carving the ledger). The Fractal weaver is more archetypal than individuated but functions well as a specific, steady counterforce whose guidance has limits. The final reorientation around the narrator’s own burden feels earned and carries a plausible cost without tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The widow’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistently embodied; her grief is expressed through tactile choices—carving a collar, leaving the tag blank, opening the window—rather than abstract labels. Motivation (to survive grief by ritual and work) is implicit but clear and stable, and contradictory impulses (preserving vs. altering, remembering vs. refusing to “fix”) operate simultaneously. The final endurance choice—to keep absence and imperfection rather than idealize him—feels earned and carries cost. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the internal conflict, while nuanced, never comes under sharp external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motive—“to negotiate with my own ghost”—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from climbing the wind-ladders to the final decision to stay. Internal conflict is vivid in the tension between scavenger self-protection and the costly act of admitting, forgiving, and rebuilding. The ghost functions as a second character with distinct demands (“payment in verbs”), sharpening the crucible without dissolving into abstraction. A slight remove from concrete embodied emotion (more metaphor than felt physiology) keeps this just shy of fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    The intern’s motivation and working style are sharply rendered—“unpaid in money, rich in questions” and using the sextant as “a habit and a promise” ground her as a particular mind. Her choices (mapping flows, rerouting water and power, inviting the janitor’s intentions) directly shape the building’s transformation. Internal contradiction is subtler: she’s idealistic yet almost clinically systemic about hope, which could be sharpened with more embodied doubt or fear. The janitor relationship nicely reveals values, but the emotional cost of her commitment remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scribe’s interiority is rich, specific, and paradoxical—his fear that “his hunger would eat the music” gives him a genuinely idiosyncratic flaw. His movement from righteous flight to recognizing that righteousness as a mask for shame and then tenderness is a credible, layered reframe. The final stance—refusing both to rebuild or renounce the city of bells—reads as an earned stasis with real cost. The only limitation is that all pressure remains purely internal, with no external relationship on the page to refract him further.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is precise and particular—the desire “not revenge, but a serenely radical correction” feels lived-in and drives every choice. Interiority is rich and character-specific, especially the way training and watercraft shape perception. The main weakness is a relative smoothness: contradictory impulses (fear vs. drive, loyalty to family vs. exposure) are more implied than dramatized under pressure. The encounter with the engineer resolves almost too calmly to fully test the protagonist’s fault lines.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation and motivation are vivid and specific—“philosophical seed collector” who wants to preserve ancient methods—and their choices (keeping vigil, decoding the rope, testing the seeds) consistently align with that. Emotional texture is mostly one note: calm, reverent attentiveness with little in-scene contradiction or sharp internal conflict. The endurance through the night and the need to “prove the braid still held” give a credible, if quiet, sense of cost. A touch more friction—doubt, temptation to hurry, or fear of failure—would deepen characterization to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation and method make for a sharply particular psyche, and his empathy toward both the woman and the absent man feels grounded and consistent. The woman’s motivation (“so that I may sit at the table without drawing a second cup”) is precise and affecting, and her emotional progression from rigid ache to irrigating weeping is credible. We get one clean statement of the narrator’s deeper drive (“to understand the geography of healing”), which is borne out by his choices without over-explaining. If there’s a limit, it’s that we see relatively little contradictory impulse or messy failure in him; he remains serenely competent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prince’s longing to “reawaken beauty in a mechanical world” is clear, consistent, and drives concrete choices: stealing the egg, building the cradle, fasting, and finally renouncing coronation for caretaking. His interiority is particular and embodied (ancestral murals, chainmail nets, the “bitterly sweet” tenderness toward the egg) rather than generic feeling labels. The internal conflict between a lineage of conquest and his compulsion to repair is present throughout and culminates credibly in his final stance. The one limitation is that his struggle faces minimal interpersonal resistance, so his change—while earned—feels slightly under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    She is sharply etched as the arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter whose inherited skill is repurposed through “unyielding compassion,” and that contradiction is felt in her rituals and in how she treats the boy. Motivation is clear (to test whether scars can “sing”) and plays through her micro-choices at the lagoon and with the seedling. The boy is sketched efficiently but distinctly, with his shame and bravery embodied in the bandaged hand and field incident. The only shortfall is that her internal conflict stays largely in lyric summary rather than being directly stressed by on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilias’s core motive—to liberate trapped memories—is clear and consistent, and his refusal of the “quick flood” is well-rooted in his established skepticism. However, his interiority remains mostly emblematic rather than deeply conflicted; we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses on the page. The strongest moment of character under pressure is his interaction with the broker, where his values concretely drive a costly refusal. The water woman is vivid but functions more as a thematic emissary than as a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives and contradictions (“heirloom pretending to be alive” vs. active gardener/teacher) are rich and specific, and their micro-choices—tuning the garden, sharing the gear, triggering the petal-rain—track cleanly with those motives. Emotional texture is embodied through action in the garden rather than label-speak. Secondary figures (child, captain) are sketched, not deeply individualized, but they serve as effective pressure and mirrors for the protagonist’s generational project. The final stance—continuing the work while “practic[ing] loosening”—reads as an earned endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The carver’s interiority is rich and specific—her rituals with the ribbon, her apprenticeship habits, and her inherited ethos from her mother all build a coherent, motivated self. The father and the dead mother both apply real pressure: the father’s steadying/not-crying stance and the mother’s “less a ghost than a gust” corrections force the narrator to calibrate ornament vs. silence. Contradictory impulses (devotion to craft vs. fear of breaking grief, desire to hold many names vs. not becoming stone herself) are present, though mostly in implication rather than explicitly dramatized crisis. The arc from tentative, hush-guided carving to articulating “movement… is the shape of our collective grief” reads earned and costly without tipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The winder’s guilt-driven precision versus his emerging ethic of “listening” is specific, embodied, and drives every choice, culminating in offering the rake handle instead of a correction. Interiority is rich and character-particular, with details like carving notches for “each conversation mended” grounding his abstract sense of responsibility. The internal contradiction—clinging to precision as a shield after his father’s death while knowing it hurts people—plays out credibly in the pause and in his changed behavior with the fisherman. The only minor limit is that the fisherman and child remain largely emblematic rather than individuated presences.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gardener’s motives and temperament (“blithe…yet shadowed,” “tenderly organized, even in grief”) are specific and consistently dramatized through his methods and care with objects. His internal shift from almost playful curiosity to grave respect (“his blithe mask soften into respect”) is earned by what he uncovers. The piece could push his conflict a bit harder—there’s little sense of moral struggle about exposing or protecting the widow’s lie—but what’s here is coherent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s role, ethics, and anxieties are sharply etched: a “surveyour of what minds have not mapped” torn between generative abundance and responsible constraint. Their fear of misuse (“sold, or closed against the curious”) and the decision to choose hinges/canal over tower/burrow feel motivated and specific. Internal conflict between decorative brilliance and “groundedly imaginative” design is dramatized rather than told. Embodied emotion is more implied than textured in the body, which keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The copyist’s devotion, precision, and quiet loneliness are specific and consistent, and her choices—tuning the radio, answering Cinder’s call, promising to “carry tempo forward”—all arise cleanly from that characterization. The occupational lens (copying silence, barlines like spider threads) makes her interiority feel particular rather than generic. What keeps this just shy of the top band is the relative lack of sharply dramatized internal contradiction or visible personal cost; her shift into the new role feels smooth and almost too untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation and interiority are rich and specific: the narrator’s need for a non-permission “blessing” and to tell the truth obliquely is consistently dramatized in choices (taking the letters, using the gallery, refusing labels). The mother is sketched economically but with credible contradiction—guarding the box, then yielding the letters and the chair. The relationship shifts in a believable way at the end when she finally witnesses and validates the work, an earned reconfiguration rather than a neat cure. Emotional texture stays embodied in tools, dust, and the chair’s rhythm rather than abstract label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s motives (preserving methods over myths) are vivid and consistent, and the internal conflict between “agonizing over the least harmful lie” and acting decisively pays off cleanly at the sluice. Interiority is particular and embodied in images (“the scream has already happened”) rather than diagnostic labels. The three petitioners are somewhat emblematic more than fully individuated, but they function effectively as pressure rather than needing deeper shading at this length. The final choice to keep the cog and reject their narratives feels earned and value-revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation—transforming conflict into harmony after failed activism—is specific, credible, and consistently drives her choices. Her mix of stubborn practice, expectant resignation, and hope gives her a distinct, embodied interiority without sliding into therapy-speak. The relationship pressure between Rafi and Ola is efficiently sketched and then tested via the rosette exchange. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle; the piece leans more on steadied conviction than on sharp, scene-level inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chef’s interiority and motivation are rich, specific, and consistently dramatized—his memory-tasting, guilt, and quiet defiance all feel deeply grounded. Micro-choices (where and what to plant, what to prune, what memories to “feed” the seed) reveal a clear hierarchy of values with cost. Internal contradiction (wanting healing while handling painful memories and an illegal act) is present, though it could be sharpened with one moment of true hesitation or fear. Secondary characters (neighbors, councilor) remain more emblematic than individuated, which slightly flattens relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator is sharply etched: involuntarily truthful, ritual-minded, with a concrete value hierarchy (“wonder prefers careful company”). His choices—demanding the riddle, withholding the box until the “right listener” arrives—clearly arise from that core trait. Mara is sketched efficiently with profession-specific detail and clear competence. The main limitation is that his internal conflict never bites very hard; truth and wonder are aligned here, so his flaw is not truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motive—“to understand why some houses feel alive and others only echo”—is clear and stable, and their choices (which houses to enter, when to leave, what to say) follow from that. Interiority is vivid through perception and metaphor more than explicit feeling, but we still get a coherent sense of someone reverent, meticulous, and slightly obsessive. There’s limited on-page contradiction or cost in their stance; they are rarely truly under pressure, which keeps this shy of top-tier. Still, the accumulated micro-choices (testing, thanking, asking to be sanctified) form a credible quiet arc.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Oris’s motivation—to “welcome nuance into a certainty”—is clear and consistently embodied in their careful, ethically-minded choices (threading the ampoule, breaking it to widen time). The push-pull with the scholar’s harsher certainty gives a legible internal/external conflict without resorting to abstraction. Emotional stakes are more conceptual than visceral; we feel persuasion and philosophy more than fear or desire, which slightly mutes impact. Still, the endurance of Oris’s stance and its cost (risking misunderstanding, slowing decisive action) reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s “grim optimist” psychology is specific and coherent, with motivation rooted in regret and an obsessive need to formalize memory (“I will do it through mathematical proofs…”). Contradictory impulses are live on the page, especially around the rupture—yearning to revisit the moment vs. refusal to step through. The choice to accept the skewed dice and keep climbing reads earned and in character. Emotional texture is a bit abstracted into metaphor, with limited bodily or sensory embodiment, which keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lina’s motive and temperament (“methodically hopeful,” insomniac, painting as a form of moral experiment) are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—working at night, tagging portraits only with a gold dot, brewing silent tea—track that psychology. The neighbor is sketched efficiently as a bearer of the city’s response rather than as a full character, which suits the scope but limits relational complexity. Internal contradiction is present (doubt vs. insistence on kindness) but largely summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment tension. The final endurance—continuing this quiet practice with new awareness—is credible but not heavily costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s blend of professional detachment, guilt about being an “embalmer,” and hunger to help gives her a specific, credible contradiction that drives every choice. Her proposal of the bread-ritual, ambivalence about the lens’s power, and eventual acceptance of responsibility all feel earned and costly. Senka is sharply sketched as a leader who both burdens and protects her, and the stranger’s confession shifts communal emotion rather than hijacking the protagonist’s arc. The final stance—still a guide, but now tending living history—locks to her earlier fears and desires in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is sharply etched: a counterclockwise clockmaker whose competence, regret, and hunger for control all drive the encounter with the stone. Interiority is specific and embodied (“barnacles on my ribs,” “my hands, neatly inventive”) and the internal contradiction—yearning to step beyond fate vs. pull toward human connection—is dramatized, not summarized. The final renunciation of the door in favor of the keeper reads as an Earned Stasis choice clearly prepared by earlier lines about cost and abandoned lovers. The keeper herself is sketched economically but feels real enough to matter as a relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s fear of nonexistence and cursed relationship to images gives them a sharp, particular interior life, and their choice to confront fear via paradox feels motivated by that flaw. The whispering advisor is vivid and exerts consistent pressure, with a clear but eerie motive (“fear owes me money”). Emotional experience is largely embodied through sensory-strange metaphors rather than conventional feeling labels, which suits the piece. The one limitation is that the cost of the narrator’s change—what they’ve risked or sacrificed long-term—remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motive—“turn obstacles into instruments”—is clear, consistent, and enacted in specific choices (arranging crates, dubbing the sea, transforming the knife net). Interiority is particular and embodied in how they hear the world, though emotional contradiction (terror vs. exultation) stays mostly implicit rather than dramatized in conflict. Zaya functions well as a brief pressure-sharing presence, but the relationship doesn’t significantly alter stakes or force a hard personal trade-off. The ending shows an earned endurance/renunciation, but the cost remains relatively soft and aesthetic rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline (find out what the watchers are, what happened to the mother, answer hunger) and stays consistent as pressure rises, culminating in the choice to step into the corridor. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory perception rather than labels (“a sound like sand poured over bone,” “light…like a warning”). There is some internal tension between turning back to warn the city vs continuing, but it skews toward principle more than messy contradiction, which slightly limits depth of internal conflict. The final choice feels fully earned and forecloses a path with clear personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The historian’s motivation and temperament (“emotionally rational,” skeptical of noble lies) are clear and consistently dramatized in choices—coming at night, opening lockers, deciding to publish. Internal conflict between mercy and truth is well-articulated and woven through the investigation. The ending stance (“tell the truth without contempt”) feels earned by prior reflection and discovery, though the cost of that stance could be embodied a bit more concretely. Overall, the character reads specific and morally complex rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a “Stoically Sensitive” surveyor whose meticulous, almost devotional method feels specific and coherent. Motivation—to witness and catalogue what’s vanished rather than restore it—is clear and consistently enacted. Internal contradiction (firmness versus tenderness, repair versus acceptance) is present but could be dramatized with a slightly sharper moment of doubt or temptation. Still, the final stance—loving “living gaps” instead of fixing the past—feels earned and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ossa’s temperament, method, and vocation cohere into a sharply particular interiority, and the desire “to trace honest origins” clearly motivates every choice from waiting for the blackout to how she uses the stamp. The archivist’s “gentle suspicion” and tranquil perceptiveness are dramatized rather than labeled, especially in how she reads discrepancies between ledgers and bills. What’s slightly missing, at this length and ambition, is a stronger sense of internal contradiction or visible emotional cost—her disturbance at what she uncovers is mostly implied rather than felt in-body. The closing choice to hide the stamp is meaningful but could register as a more conflicted or costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lantern maker’s motive is crystal clear and specific—returning or at least reconciling with his shadow by “fold[ing] grief into origami cranes”—and his actions all flow from that drive. Interiority is embedded in sensory, craft-based perception rather than abstract labels, which keeps him vivid and particular. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (he both accepts ongoing loss and still works meticulously to repair it), so the emotional field is rich but not deeply torn. The closing loosening of the ache feels earned by the sustained, concrete labor we’ve seen him do.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, particular, and rooted in a specific trauma (“drone strike wedding survivor” with a geode fused into her shoulder) that convincingly motivates her obsession with “unused potential.” The tension between scientific rigor, quasi-mystical belief in the crystal as “oracle,” and ethical unease about harvesting the valley’s latent force gives her a layered, non-generic psyche. The final vow “to remain awake, to keep the measure open and unclean” feels like an earned stasis that fits her contradictions. A slightly clearer on-page clash between her role as data-gatherer and the commander’s probable militarized aims could sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pilot and the pilgrim are both vivid, with clear, coherent motives rooted in belonging and attention, and their relationship evolves credibly from professional task to shared revelation. The pilot’s self-definition (“I belong to whoever needs the horizon to be a sentence”) and late recalibration “for kindness” feel earned by on-page choices (launching drones, revising the algorithm, listening to the pilgrim). The pilgrim’s arc from “perpetually surprised” to steadier reader of the final message is subtle but present. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper dramatized contradiction or a concrete cost to their change beyond conceptual reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s guilt, professional corruption, and buried debt to Abel/Mara create a rich, coherent interior conflict that drives every choice. Specific flaws—cowardice, self-justification, urge to “quell attention”—are dramatized rather than labeled, and the final acts (confessing, burning archives, keeping one page) feel earned and costly. The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible without slipping into melodrama; her response of “tempered regret” is believable and thorny. If anything, I’d welcome a single sharper moment of embodied breakdown in the narrator around the beach revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with the drawer pull and inherited role grounding their motives under pressure. Their micro-choices—insisting on listening, reframing the snagged second trade—clearly arise from being “uncommonly thoughtful.” Raglen and Della are efficiently but distinctly sketched, with legible status dynamics in very few strokes. The arc is more an earned stasis than a decisive change, which suits the piece but softens the sense of a transformed inner state.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory: he’s self-lacerating yet still competent and compelled to keep showing up. His choice to help the boy, despite self-doubt and guilt, is entirely motivated by prior regret and his stated desire to “align heart and action.” The cost—reopening navigational authority after a fatal mistake—is legible and paid on the page. The “broken but working” admission and how he handles the father’s shame crystallize his arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s guilt, professional past (“engineered slogans that sold indifference as strength”), and post-procedure unease create a specific, credible psyche. Motivation is clear and consistent, and the final decision to stay and ferry others feels earned and costly. Internal conflict between wanting a clean slate and needing to face moral residue is present if mostly expressed through reflection rather than embodied reaction. Relationship with the caretaker is lightly sketched but functional as a pressure and mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s longing for Mira and fear of losing their own selfhood generate a credible, layered internal conflict that culminates in the choice to become a “passage.” Motivation is clear, rooted in shared history (kitchens, naming spices) and intensifies as the cost of metamorphosis comes into focus. The relationship dynamic—Mira’s practicality (“She asks the price, always practical”) versus the narrator’s reluctance—adds texture and pressure. If anything, Mira remains slightly more emblem than fully individuated person, but the piece mostly overcomes this through concrete sensory callbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation (guilt over “lost time” after childbirth) is specific, consistent, and drives every choice, from climbing to the glade to undertaking the rite. Interiority is rich and particular—details like the unbraided hair and half-finished lullabies keep the emotions grounded rather than abstract. Internal conflict between wanting to “beg back” time and accepting she can only atone, not retrieve, is clear and pays off in her refusal to ask when she will fail again. A slight limitation is that the daughter remains entirely off-page, so the relationship pressure is powerful but one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and particular—her pacifism, grief, and strange buoyancy all feel integrated—and her arc from brittle avoidance toward integrated compassion is clearly earned by the shadow work. The motive to open the lock is consistent and drives her choices, especially the decision to face her own "wolves." Emotional life is slightly more conceptual than embodied at times, but the contradictions (joy that must coexist with sorrow) are dramatized rather than merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is sharply etched: a “destitute philanthropist” who has moved from money to time to “coincidence” is an immediately distinctive psychology, and her embarrassment about fulfilling prophecies adds a credible, specific flaw. Her actions—using jars and hush to orchestrate an evacuation rehearsal that looks like worship—align tightly with those motives. Internal conflict (wanting usefulness without mythic vanity) is present but fairly subtle and never forces a truly painful trade-off. The endurance at the end (accepting others’ prophetic reading while pretending not to hear) lands as an earned, quiet renunciation, though the personal cost could be shaded slightly more.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and the lock–quill–mother lineage gives them specificity. However, inner contradiction is muted; they move from intent to execution with almost no doubt or visible emotional cost. Fara and Rhun are sketched with a few strong strokes (Rhun’s medals “dreaming of their own reflections” is sharp), but their shifts, especially Rhun’s, come a bit too easily. The final stance—“because I am the lock, the sentinel, and the door that learns”—feels earned conceptually but not fully stress-tested emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motives are clear and specific—the narrator’s promise, the brother’s belief in grammar beneath currents, the herder’s weary acceptance of her curse—and they all converge cleanly at the tradeoff. The eel herder in particular feels rich and particular, with the “ache that followed every accuracy” giving her real texture. Internal conflict is present but slightly underplayed; the narrator’s decision to accept becoming part of the patterns could tolerate a hair more hesitation on the page. Still, the final choice and its cost are well earned by prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation (to decode and reclaim the “cartography of scars”) is clear and consistently drives each micro-choice, and the caretaker is sharply etched in very little space. Their relationship has a quiet but real crucible quality, especially around the revelation of the shared teacher. Internal contradiction is present (fear vs “furiously tranquil” composure) but somewhat under-dramatized on the page. The final stance—“This is why I write”—feels earned, though the inner conflict never quite bites as hard as it might.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s characterization as a “dueling philosopher” with a mechanical arm is vivid and consistent, and their choices (using the needle card tactically, choosing to step into the gate) clearly arise from that blend of intellect and combativeness. Emotional interiority is implied through perception and metaphor more than explicit feeling, which fits the voice but slightly mutes embodied conflict. The small but telling moment—“He faltered, not at the truth, but at the invitation to lose and proceed simultaneously”—shows nuanced understanding of others. What’s missing for the very top band is a more dramatized internal contradiction under peak pressure rather than a largely assured, composed throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s interiority and lived contradictions (molting personas vs. clinging to this night) are vivid and specific, and Lio’s presence reads as a real, tested bond rather than a prop. Motivation to keep the library alive and seed resistance is clear and consistent. However, the piece rarely forces the narrator into a sharply pressured choice; most actions feel like a fluent outpouring of who they already are rather than a test that might crack them. The internal conflict around identity loss is more stated than dramatized through difficult micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pianist’s longing to “surprise fate with an unplanned encore” is clear, consistent, and drives every choice from threading the reel to staging the arbor performance. Interiority is particular and embodied through how he reads clocks, compasses, and timetables, rather than via abstract labels. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—he doesn’t visibly waver between obedience and defiance so much as move steadily into his plan—so the evolution is a touch smooth. Still, the final quiet satisfaction at the delayed train feels earned by prior motives and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motive—to safeguard the island’s “reef of stories”—is specific, consistent, and governs every choice, from testing dreams against pelicans to where and how they plant the seed. Interiority is rendered through idiosyncratic perception (“empirically whimsical,” “luminous doubt”) rather than label-speak, and Iru’s presence sharpens stakes instead of cluttering them. The central change—ceding some authority as the island begins to “keep waking itself”—is earned by prior doubt and labor, though the emotional cost of that partial self-displacement could be felt more sharply. There’s modest internal contradiction (rigor vs whimsy, duty vs doubt), but it never quite breaks into fully dramatized inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (bonsai tutor who “prune[s] storms into miniatures”), with a clear throughline of obedience vs the need to speak. Motivation—to find the color of unspoken apologies and reconfigure their teaching—is legible and consistent. The final renunciation of controlling storms in favor of “pruning only what asked” feels earned by the prior pattern of obedience and repression. The only small limit is that the severed relationship itself remains abstract, so relational pressure is powerful but one-step removed.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s professional background is not merely ornamental; it dictates her perceptual filter and drives the central conflict between "flamboyant fireworks" and "simpler mathematics." The resolution—a methodological pivot in her life’s work—is a earned character beat that manifests visible cost (abandoning her previous flashy models). Internal contradiction is successfully dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, successfully blending occupational identity with the narrative arc. However, the antagonist remains a caricature defined by a "villainous laugh," and the explicit declaration of the attribute ("I am steadily adaptive, I told the cliffs") reads as forced exposition rather than embodied character trait, momentarily breaking the naturalism of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by their history and function, but lacks agency in the present moment. The central struggle—correcting the translation algorithm—is relegated to a backstory summary ("The first time I tried..."), leaving the present timeline as a low-stakes ritual rather than a scene of active conflict. The character feels more like a tour guide for the concept than a person navigating a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is meticulously mapped to the external action, creating a seamless blend of role and psyche. The transition from a "weary undertaker" performing rote duties to a custodian of the library is earned through decisive, character-specific choices. The renunciation of the surface world ("tell them the undertaker is not missing") serves as a powerful, cost-laden closure to the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara serves as a noble archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking visible internal conflict or flaws to complicate her leadership. The collective "we" voice distances the reader from individual agency, making the protagonists feel like a reactive monolith rather than people making hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist functions as a lyrical vessel rather than a dramatic agent; interiority consists of abstract poetic assertions ("maker of mirrors who forgot to love") rather than embodied psychology. There is no internal struggle or contradictory impulse on the page; the "healing" is achieved through a magical process without emotional resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation to "guide grief into singing" grounds the surrealism effectively, and the internal conflict regarding the father is compelling. However, the density of sensory filtering occasionally obscures the character's agency; they often feel more like a passive observer of marvels than a driver of action until the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara displays clear agency and competence, but her characterization relies heavily on assertive telling ("She is a chained liberator," "She is patiently strategic") rather than organic revelation through behavior. The pervasive repetitive sentence structure ("She [verb]s") flattens her internal nuance, making her feel more like an archetype than a vulnerable, living protagonist. While her actions drive the plot, the lack of visible internal struggle or doubt limits emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich and the motivation—to map the acoustics of betrayal—is compelling. However, the emotional arc is relatively linear; the pivotal choice to forgive serves as a solution rather than a source of active, agonizing struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    The protagonist has a coherent arc from thief to restorer, but interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor rather than embodied emotion ("breath carried a hush"). The motivation is explicitly told via the prompt phrase rather than dramatized through desire. The emotional cost of the final sacrifice feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    Arlen is a consistent, distinct focalizer with a clear objective, but his journey lacks internal friction. He overcomes his "old fear" via summary rather than a dramatized pressure point, making him feel more like a vehicle for the theme than a character making difficult choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's stunt-double background is brilliantly integrated into the decryption method (dates of broken bones), grounding the character in physical history. However, the emotional pivot from betrayal to cooperation feels rushed and slightly under-motivated; the immediate acceptance of the "brother" and the shared plan compresses a complex reaction into a convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle is a strong archetypal presence, but the courier’s sudden conversion ("a space opens where his fear had been") feels convenient and atmospherically forced rather than psychologically earned. The characters function primarily as vessels for the theme, lacking contradictory internal impulses or grit beyond their mythic roles.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is exquisitely rendered, blending mechanical sensory input with profound philosophical longing. The tension between the programmed "composure" and the desire to find the origin of thought creates a compelling, specific interiority. The acceptance of the "mundane mysticism" at the end feels like a fully earned, character-specific resolution to the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator’s internal state is well-drawn, with a clear motivation to "thaw mistrust." However, the character arc—overcoming cowardice to reveal the truth—feels unearned because the anticipated risk (social rejection) evaporates instantly upon the reveal. The resolution provides total absolution without demanding a localized sacrifice or enduring consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending aphoristic wisdom with specific vulnerability ("sunburned me into string and grit"). The internal arc from performing competence to admitting deception is clear, though the shift comes relatively easily. The "withered" physicality informs the voice well, grounding the magical elements in an exhausted, resilient body.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Jae is a distinct, competent focalizer whose internal life drives the narrative. The "obliging" nature contrasts beautifully with the existential risk he takes, and the ending—where he accepts the secret of his own "sideways" existence—adds a layer of earned, distinct interiority that avoids stock heroism.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist is effectively drawn as a spectral figure defined by their role and environment. The motivation—a mix of fear and "pilgrim's curiosity"—drives the action consistently, and the internal landscape mirrors the external setting beautifully. The choice to conduct silence is a strong, character-specific resolution that aligns perfectly with the established identity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—to weigh a swallowed truth—is visceral and drives every interaction, while the Oracle's specific trait of "fault tolerance" actively shapes the scene's resolution. The shared lyrical register between narrator and dialogue creates a coherent mythic tone, though it slightly blurs the distinct voice of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is viscerally specific; the need to weigh "swallowed truth" drives every interaction with the setting. The moment where "disobedient" hands turn the wheel creates a perfect conflict between the son’s grief and the explorer’s skepticism. Internal contradictions (skepticism vs. ritual) are dramatized through action rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's renunciation of judgment is a compelling, defining trait that drives the narrative stance ("no gavel, no verdict"). While the character is largely reactive—following the swan, waiting out the flood—this passivity is purposeful and thematically integrated into the role of a witness. The internal consistency of the "chronicle keeper" persona is high, though the reliance on the swan for the critical decision (burrowing) limits the sense of active agency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator functions as a stable guide but lacks internal contradiction or personal risk; traits are established via labels ("softly adaptive," "mellow") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Ada provides a focal point, but her shift from resistance to relief feels smooth and inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the setting's atmosphere rather than a distinct agent with internal contradictions. His trait of being "sensitively perceptive" is stated as a label rather than fully dramatized through difficult choices. While he acts to reorganize the library at the end, the emotional cost is low; he feels less like a character under pressure and more like an archetype serving the fable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator possesses a distinct, lyrical voice that fits the fable-like tone perfectly, and the choice to subvert the spy mission is clear. However, the character lacks visceral internal conflict or doubt; the path from receiving the specs to the lighthouse feels frictionless, making them more of an archetypal vessel than a deeply struggling protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilario is a competent archetype—a functional troubleshooter—rather than a struggling individual. He executes a practiced protocol without facing internal doubt, limits, or significant personal risk. While the "loop pedal priest" persona is distinct, the lack of internal friction or costly choices caps the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation (“to become the conductor of unheard symphonies”) is distinct and drives the surreal logic of the scene. Interiority is rich and consistent, though the attribute “chronologically homesick” feels slightly labeled rather than fully dramatized in the opening. The character functions effectively as a poetic lens, though the emotional stakes feel more aesthetic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's defining trait (gravity defiance) is not just a power but a psychological crutch, making the decision to surrender it a meaningful character beat. The internal conflict between the safety of hovering and the necessity of grounding drives the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s internal state is clearly drawn, and her connection to the physical sensation of sound is compellingly specific ("read his palms," "posture"). However, the inciting motivation ("feared numbness") is stated rather than dramatized through a specific failure or interaction, making the "cure" feel slightly smoother than the established stakes warrant. The emotional shift is earned through the ritual, though the initial deficit relies on exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a voice that unifies the "storm recorder" persona with their worldview. Agency is high, demonstrated through the decoy trap and the decision to send data to the archivist. However, the interiority occasionally relies on list-like constructions ("The nurse in me... the clerk in me...") which feel like a rhetorical scaffold rather than organic thought during a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal arc from avoidance to integration is clear, but the opening self-definition ("I am a wistful lantern broker") relies on telling rather than showing. While the emotional progression is sound, the interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic labeling ("hunger for meaning") rather than embodying the struggle in action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("drifting roadside poet") rather than grounded psychology. Motivation is stated as a philosophical concept ("discover the texture of time") rather than a visceral drive, and the "vow" scene feels performative, inserting prompt language ("ethically playful") that disrupts organic character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrator functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure; their wisdom feels static and pre-earned rather than tested in the scene. Lark serves primarily as a prompt for the protagonist's philosophical exposition rather than an independent agent of friction. While the internal voice is consistent, the motivation ("find beauty in the unfinished") is declared in dialogue rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's internal contradiction—peddling counterfeits while seeking genuine "tougher" connections—drives the narrative effectively. Rhea’s specific yearning to "fuse insight with empathy" provides clear, actionable pressure that forces the dealer to craft a unique solution. The dynamic is professional yet intimate, with the "static" serving as a tangible proxy for their relationship status.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies on static labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive") and summarized emotions ("cautious exuberance") rather than embodied reactions. There are no on-page micro-choices or internal conflicts; characters simply execute the synopsis-like plot without resistance or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation (grafting onto community) is clear, but the core trait "boldly sympathetic" reads as an inserted label rather than a driver of difficult choices. Internal states are often summarized through abstract metaphors ("mouthful of unsung lullabies") rather than dramatized through friction or specific behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's profession as a natural history illustrator is not merely a label but the lens through which the entire magic system is perceived and engaged ("trusted observations," "larvae," "sketching"). The internal conflict between the desire to capture the specimen and the wisdom to "uncage" it is effectively dramatized in the climax. Motivation is sharply defined, and the voice remains distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ambiguous loss," "clean grief") and intellectualized metaphors rather than embodied emotion. While the backstory of the sister provides a grounding moment, the character feels more like a vessel for the story's "mathematical" conceit than a living presence making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's desire "to become visible to those who need you" is distinct and drives the narrative arc effectively. Interiority is lyrical and consistent, though occasionally bordering on twee ("heart big as a boiler"). The internal conflict between safety (invisibility) and connection is resolved through a meaningful compromise at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara is clearly defined, but her development occurs through summary and montage rather than a pressurized scenic crucible. The pivotal shift in her character—from controller to listener—is narrated as a smooth realization ("She listened, finally") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrator and the lighthouse keeper are virtually indistinguishable in voice and temperament; the text even explicitly labels both of them "wryly earnest." This mirroring collapses the cast into a single mood rather than creating distinct individuals with friction. The internal motivation ("thresh meaning") is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The contrast between the clairvoyant’s confidence and their actual blindness to the outcome provides a solid ironic anchor. However, the guide remains largely passive, observing the baker rather than driving the turn. The baker’s characterization relies heavily on flour/dough metaphors that feel slightly imposed rather than organic to the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and thematically consistent, effectively embodying the specialized "archivist" archetype. However, the interaction lacks interpersonal friction; the woman functions primarily as a cooperative thematic catalyst rather than a character exerting resistance. The emotional cost is articulated eloquently but feels intellectualized rather than viscerally demonstrated through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is consistent but functions more as an allegorical vehicle than a flesh-and-blood character. Internal states are often labeled ("fear and habit," "trembling certainty") rather than dramatized through friction, and the emotional resolution ("bowed to them") feels somewhat unearned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's skepticism is stated ("I had come as a sympathetic skeptic") but offers little resistance to the magical events, dissolving without a dramatized struggle or cost. Lio functions more as a catalyst for the ritual than a fully realized character, and the "naming of losses" at the climax feels summarized rather than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending weariness with high-concept lyrical perception, though the "bored immortal" persona occasionally feels like a posture rather than a lived reality. Lio functions well as a foil, but his emotional pivot—trading a century-old grudge for a "future tense" inside the corridor—feels transactional and accelerated, lacking sufficient on-page resistance to make the release of anger viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—honesty versus the father’s legacy of lies—is visceral and drives the narrative. The relationship with the absent father acts as a crucible, giving weight to the final choice to sign the ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is defined by a distinct, cohesive voice and a clear role as the "keeper" of the town's silence. While the internal landscape is rich with metaphor, the character lacks sharp, contradictory impulses enacted in the scene; the struggle is more existential and atmospheric than immediate and psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s agency is distinct and paradoxical: he asserts power by embracing his erasure, culminating in a choice that prioritizes psychological leverage over legal restoration. The internal contradiction—seeking the "texture of memories" while hunting cold, hard evidence—drives the narrative effectively. His refusal to reclaim his name creates a strong "Earned Stasis" closure where the cost is the permanence of his ghost status.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is a distinct, lyrical archetype with specific tools and a clear worldview ("trusted ribs more than logic"). However, his internal struggle remains somewhat abstract; while he "disproved and loved" stories, this conflict doesn't force a difficult choice on the page. He courts the myth and receives it without a significant personal cost or transformation beyond the confirmation of his beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nessa’s voice is distinct, and her agency drives the resolution. The "dual allegiance" is externalized well through the brother, though the internal emotional cost is sometimes told ("arguments were soft but sharp") rather than fully dramatized in the moment. Her motivation is clear and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich and specific, blending professional duty with a lineage-driven connection to the task (the Nightwatch legacy). Motivation is clear—securing funding via proof—and the emotional stakes of "witnessing" add depth. The reflection on the mother is well-integrated, grounding the use of the sand grain in character history rather than just plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist displays professional competence, but her "heartfelt" nature exists only as a repeated label rather than a dramatized trait. Internal conflict is absent; she faces external technical hurdles without personal cost or contradictory impulses, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is functional but the "dry-witted" trait is stated rather than dramatized; the narrative voice is earnest and lyrical, explicitly noting the wit is "unneeded." Motivation is clear, but the character faces no internal contradiction or agonizing choice, merely following instructions to success.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype (the mysterious healer) rather than a fully realized character; his "infinite patience" is a stated label rather than a tested trait. The mother serves as a functional proxy for the town but converts to his cause with minimal resistance, lacking the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for high-band characterization. The emotional landscape is described ("arguments hardened") rather than dramatized through complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's specific expertise and mythic voice are compelling, creating a distinct "science-fantasy" persona. However, the reliance on "instinct" to resolve the central internal crisis (panic) feels like a mechanical toggle rather than a deeply felt psychological choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist is strongly defined by the "cry wolf" archetype, which informs his voice and worldview. However, his motivation remains somewhat abstract and mythopoetic, distancing the reader from the visceral cost of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Ghost Bride is vividly realized through details like "cinders like confetti" and distinct dialogue, grounding the fable in specific character dynamics. The relationship serves as an effective crucible for the protagonist's growth, though the "farmer heart" backstory relies slightly on summary rather than dramatized past action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sera is a competent, archetypal protagonist who fits the mythic mode but lacks internal friction. Her choices are linear and noble without the hesitation or contradictory impulses that create psychological depth; she succeeds because she is "optimistic" and skilled, not because she navigates a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation is abstract ("restore lost faith") and interiority relies on diagnostic metaphors ("ache that never quite cleared its throat") rather than embodied contradiction or choice under pressure. The protagonist faces no genuine crucible; the "choice" to rebuild is cooperative and frictionless, lacking the conflicting impulses or visible cost required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a voice steeped in professional melancholy that fits the concept. Interiority is rich, though at times it veers into abstraction ("names are the gates") rather than grounded emotion. The realization regarding the "new mark" being their "own hand" blurs agency—it is unclear if this is a literal action in the present or a memory, slightly destabilizing the character's presence in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct and the "witness" archetype serves the fable mode well, but the protagonist lacks internal friction. The "fool" persona is articulated clearly but functions more as a retrospective explanation than a live tactical choice under pressure. The acceptance of "blame" is poetic but feels weightless without a dramatized struggle or visible alternative foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the arc from hoarding fear to "witnessing honestly" is clear and motivated. The specific "cryptic medium" persona is established well through voice, though the character relies slightly on abstract labels for their emotional state ("failed the kindness," "tenderness hoarded") rather than dramatized interaction until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator is defined clearly by vocation, and the internal voice is consistent. However, the character functions primarily as a frictionless conduit for wisdom, lacking personal cost or error; the boy's "shrewdly innocent" wisdom feels convenient, serving as a plot device rather than a grounded character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist has a distinct, lyrical voice ("vivid by temperament"), but the internal landscape remains static. The motivation ("rediscover lost joy") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices, making the character feel more like a vehicle for imagery than a person under pressure. The interaction with the "boy/mirror maker" adds whimsy but deepens the surrealism rather than the human stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist is vividly realized through the specific intersection of professional expertise and personal history. The internal conflict—fear of erasing life versus the mandate for faithful restoration—is dramatized beautifully in the dialogue with the wall, leading to a renunciation of "certainty" that feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's specific "rogue scholar" background actively drives the plot through the footnote/legal loophole strategy, creating a cohesive link between character and action. Internal motivation is clear and embodied in the "gourd rattle seed" memory, though the "we" collective slightly diffuses individual emotional cost during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("insomniac poet," "shyly unstoppable") rather than dramatized behaviors or difficult choices. The central internal conflict—vigilance vs. devotion—is asserted in summary rather than felt through resistance or struggle in the moment; the hesitation at the climax resolves instantly without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is a consistent, stylized archetype whose internal struggle with past failure ("rain-dial") grounds the present action. However, interiority relies heavily on metaphorical labels ("foxglove regret," "polish of years") rather than contradictory, embodied human emotion, creating a distance that limits visceral connection.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's specific internal conflict ("carefully reckless") drives the ritual and the risk-taking, creating a strong character signature. The relationship dynamic feels lived-in, though Lio's transition from "terrible courtesy" to collaboration is slightly rapid and frictionless, reducing the felt pressure of the reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator is competent and possesses a distinct voice, but lacks deep interiority or genuine struggle. The emotional reactions ("tremble") are stated rather than earned through difficult choices, and the character functions more as a vehicle for the prose than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly drawn through ritual and metaphor, creating a consistent internal logic. However, the backstory ("gave my music to the wrong mind") remains a vague abstraction, lacking the concrete specificity needed to fully ground the trauma. The emotional arc resolves through aesthetic determination rather than a gritty, embodied grappling with the fear of betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator's internal landscape is rich and consistent, driven by a specific, poignant yearning that resolves in a difficult, active choice (renunciation). The "featherly determined" trait feels slightly inserted rather than organic to the character's voice, but the final decision to maintain distance reveals deep characterization through action.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator is observant and reflective, fitting the "landscape astrologer" role, but functions more as a vessel for the prose than an agent with deep internal conflict. Rin serves as a functional companion without independent agency or friction, and the motivation is stated explicitly ("motive was plain and private") rather than emerging through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is a distinct stylistic vehicle but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; emotions are aestheticized ("vowels weep") rather than embodied. The "cheerful gloom" acts as a static label rather than a source of psychological friction or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's analytical interiority is distinct, treating human interaction as a "calculus of misrule." The janitor’s backstory—grief moving "like a bishop"—is efficiently dramatized, creating a genuine emotional connection that justifies the narrator's manipulation. The character voices are distinct and the protagonist's motivation to "make luck happen" drives every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator is clearly defined as a "tide dancer," but the heavy lyrical filter creates emotional distance, obscuring genuine interiority behind metaphor. The cartographer functions more as a symbolic prop or canvas than a fully realized character with agency, limiting the relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's specialized voice ("hands know salt") strongly anchors the magical realism. However, the boy functions primarily as a thematic device to prompt the glazier's insight rather than as a fully realized character with independent agency. The internal motivation is clear, but the emotional struggle resolves somewhat easily through the pond ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rendered with deep specificity; the shift from solitary guilt ("bargained innocence") to shared vulnerability is earned in the scene. The "hands as maps" beat authentically grounds the emotional connection between the two characters.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined by self-applied labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") rather than choices made under pressure. The interaction with the parallel self lacks friction or distinct interpersonal dynamics, functioning as a frictionless mirror rather than a relationship with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is more a vessel for the concept than a living person; their "vow" is stated rather than dramatized through resistance or cost. While the "sensitively perceptive" trait drives action, the internal conflict (shirk vs. map) is resolved too easily, lacking the contradictory impulses required for higher marks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal struggle—balancing the "borrowed heartbeat" with a history of "defeat"—is rendered with strong emotional specificity. The transition from desperation to "braided" discipline feels earned within the lyric mode. The painter functions effectively as a catalyst, though her characterization relies slightly on the wise-mentor archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is a calm, consistent vessel for the story's fable-like tone, embodying the "operatively gentle" trait effectively. While the character lacks deep internal contradictions or personal stakes beyond the professional role, this fits the ritualistic mode. The supporting cast (General, soldier) serves as effective, if slightly archetypal, foils for the protagonist's mediation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archetype is distinct, but the protagonist’s "secret sentimentality" is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized through genuine struggle or costly micro-choices. He navigates the scene with total control, lacking the internal friction that would make his final release feel earned rather than merely performed.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic archetype rather than a living character, defined entirely by the label "chaste courtesan" and the stated motivation to "defy the lullaby." Interiority is abstract and stylized, lacking the specific emotional friction or doubt that creates genuine agency.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sorin's internal conflict regarding artistic theft is well-drawn, and the shift from "script and adorn" to listening creates a legible arc. However, the character sometimes functions as a mouthpiece for the theme ("hands felt suddenly like tools for theft") rather than an embodied presence, and the "urbane" trait is stated more than dramatized in interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is defined by a self-applied label ("esoteric realist") rather than distinct personality traits or high-stakes choices. Interiority consists largely of abstract philosophical assertions ("names composting under municipal forgetfulness") rather than embodied emotion or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with forgiveness is inextricably linked to their craft ("technically gentle"), creating a compelling, specific interiority. The dissociation of the "second person" mirror game effectively dramatizes the fracture mentioned in the backstory, though the syntax of "forgiving yourself" is slightly slippery.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist has a distinct, lyrical voice, but functions more as a vessel for prose poetry than a grounded character with visceral stakes. The specific trait "precisely playful" is applied as a repetitive label rather than organically demonstrated through high-stakes choices, making the personality feel slightly manufactured.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's "frugality" operates as a distinct worldview rather than just a trait, grounding the voice and motivation. The internal conflict—empirical maintenance versus the "palace of myths"—is resolved through a quiet but costly vow (spending "hours" and "oil") that feels entirely earned by the character's established values.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator's "scheming pacifist" identity is established well, offering a distinct lens on the healing process. However, Rell functions primarily as a vessel for the sanctuary's magic rather than an agent of his own change; his resistance is overcome by the environment rather than a hard internal choice. The emotional arc is touching but relies on the setting doing the heavy lifting for the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilen’s characterization as a "worker of surfaces" rather than a mystic grounds the fantastical premise in tangible craftsmanship, giving his actions specific weight. His method of steadying Noor—counting orchard seasons—reveals a distinct, practical worldview that drives the resolution effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict regarding the unopened tin and the "missing laugh" provides a strong emotional anchor to the fantastical task. The connection between his profession ("quartz-eye mender") and his personal failure ("bad with goodbyes") is thematically tight. The "mending" of the orchard effectively mirrors his internal state without over-explaining the parallel until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist has distinct, quirky traits ("philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms") and a clear internal state. However, the transformation from bewildered to resolute relies heavily on the magical mechanics of the fruit rather than a deeply pressured emotional struggle, making the arc feel slightly accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist functions more as a lyrical device than a grounded character; emotions are described through abstract metaphors ("consequences we had misnamed as fate") rather than embodied experience. The motivation is stated clearly but executed with dream-logic ease, preventing genuine psychological struggle or development.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (discoverer vs. person) is compelling and drives the narrative arc effectively. The "chimera twin" aspect is integrated as a psychological duality rather than just a label, paying off in the final renunciation. Motivation is clear and sustained throughout the surreal environment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is defined by competence and a static trait ("warmly methodical") rather than internal contradiction or struggle. He faces no genuine dilemma; his expertise functions as a skeleton key that unlocks the plot without personal cost, doubt, or psychological deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is a competent professional whose motivation and agency are clear, driving the procedural arc. However, internal conflict is minimal—limited to a moment of "pretended confidence"—and the character lacks a distinct personal flaw or contradictory impulse that would heighten the emotional stakes beyond mere endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist has a distinct voice but functions primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a deeply conflicted agent; the internal drive to "prove coincidence" is stated more than felt. The relationship with Lio lacks friction or distinct interpersonal dynamics ("both asks met"), resulting in a smooth collaboration that misses the opportunity for a "relationship as crucible" dynamic. The emotional cost of the final success feels minimal, reducing the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between the role of a passive "binder" and the desire to be a "page" is compelling and drives the narrative arc effectively. However, the motivation is articulated through abstract label-speak ("sculpt identity from experience") rather than emerging purely from dramatic friction, which slightly distances the reader from the character's felt need.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist has a distinct, lyrical voice and a clear motivation, but the characterization lacks internal conflict or interpersonal friction. Lark functions primarily as a compliant helper rather than a fully realized agent, resulting in a low-pressure dynamic that relies on archetype rather than specific personality.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, anchored well in the "chronicler" persona. However, the internal conflict feels slightly managed through metaphor ("laugh fester," "fear thaw") rather than viscerally felt, and the "soft reset" resolution—where the cost of moving is philosophically nullified—dampens the emotional stakes of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (claustrophobia vs. the need for safety) is inextricably linked to the external action. The choice to bring the "gilded hush" to the father is a definitive act of vulnerability that bridges the character gap. The doll serves as an excellent, grounded objective correlative for the child's capacity to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Character motivation is distinct and deeply integrated with backstory (the singer), driving the operator’s specific method of comfort. The mathematician serves as a perfect foil, with internal turbulence dramatized through physical cues ("hands... betrays turbulence") rather than exposition, leading to a palpable emotional shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and the role of "lore keeper" is well-established, but the internal conflict is muted. The explicit denial of "crown hunger" removes the potential for a difficult, high-stakes choice at the climax, making the renunciation feel inevitable rather than earned against temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is a clear archetype ("shadow keeper") with a distinct goal, but interiority often relies on abstract thesis statements ("leaving can be an act of stewardship") rather than embodied experience. The character functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living person, and the student ("girl and a crater") remains a metaphorical shape until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist's history as a "pyramid scheme survivor" is perfectly integrated, transforming the "ghosts" into externalized doubt that drives the internal conflict. The choice to "sign my name" (taking responsibility) earns the resolution by confronting the specific trauma of the "ruined ledger."

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal state is well-rendered, balancing the weight of heritage with the relief of duty discharged. The emotional arc—from shame to validation—is clear, though the lack of active resistance or doubt in the moment makes the journey feel smooth rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivation is anchored beautifully by the specific backstory of the mother/puppeteer, moving the protagonist beyond a generic "weary warrior" archetype. The internal shift from "thunder" to "tending" is dramatized through physical actions (unsnapping the gorget) rather than just introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is rich and the voice is distinct, blending professional duty with deep empathy. However, the specific ability to read narrative history from dust patterns borders on magical realism, which creates a slight tonal friction with the otherwise grounded setting. The subject (Micah) feels idealized rather than complex, serving more as a vessel for the theme than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and external labeling ("Everyone said Mara was," "quiet clerk") rather than dramatized behavior. While Mara acts competently, she faces no internal conflict or meaningful cost, making her feel more like a fable archetype than a complex protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is enacted vividly through the technical details of the performance; the "learned tremor" and choice of register ground the emotion in physical action. The cost of the vigil is palpable in the "ache that the rock carries," creating a deeply felt sense of endurance (Earned Stasis). The connection to the missing teacher adds a layer of specific, personal stakes that anchors the mythic task.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist possesses a distinct, lyrical internal voice suited to the fable-like quality ("sift of lightfall," "tasting river clay"). However, the internal conflict is mild—mostly a matter of procedural discipline—and the stakes for the character feel low, lacking a contradictory impulse that forces a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's identity as a tinkerer grounds the narrative, but interiority often drifts into abstract summarization of themes rather than embodied emotion. The motivation ("stabilize my plans") feels intellectualized and stated rather than viscerally felt, creating a character who functions more as a vessel for the lesson than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s alchemical worldview is not just a trait but the engine of their interiority; every thought filters through "slag," "alloy," and "calibration." The shift from refusing closure to finding "measured remembrance" is a decisive internal arc earned through the specific ritual action. The contradictory impulse—wanting the impossible (return) versus respecting the "truth of matter"—drives the scene with tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist functions as a compassionate archetype rather than a complex character. While the internal motivation ("integrate laughter into healing") is clear, the lack of internal contradiction or significant struggle renders the emotional arc flat. The "modestly fearless" trait appears as a label rather than a behavior tested by genuine threat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal landscape of trauma is vividly drawn, with specific details like "morse in tendon twitches" grounding the experience. Motivation is clear, though the emotional arc feels slightly cerebral; the character processes pain through abstract math rather than visceral struggle, creating a layer of distance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype with a clear professional drive ("honor overlooked histories"). However, the "cost" ("this is how I eat") feels more conceptual than visceral, and the emotional stakes are somewhat distanced by the mythic, performative interiority. The character acts as a flawless vessel for the magic rather than a conflicted human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent, but the internal conflict ("lines where duty and curiosity pulled different ways") is stated rather than dramatized; the decision to release the ghosts feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The self-description "I am skillfully observant" is a "tell" that undermines the immersive authority of the voice, diagnosing a trait rather than trusting the reader to infer it from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's professional competence merges seamlessly with personal grief, grounding abstract magical stakes in a concrete emotional cost (giving up the perfect eternity for a survivable moment). The internal conflict drives the external resolution perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, successfully blending the weariness of a "defunct revolutionary" with the lyrical intensity of a poet. The motivation—to reclaim history from a narrative of tyranny—is compelling and clearly drives the action. Ledger serves as a functional, if slightly archetypal, foil; while he represents the opposing view clearly, his "immaculate cruelty" feels a touch monochromatic compared to the narrator's nuanced melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's specific vulnerability—wilting near dishonesty—is expertly leveraged to drive both the threshold confrontation and the climax. The sacrifice of the shadow serves as a distinct, legible cost that permanently alters the character's state, satisfying the requirement for high-stakes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's specific eccentricity is brilliantly dramatized through the "petrichor collector" role, grounding the magical realism in character logic. The internal conflict between seeking explanations and accepting "failure" is resolved with a credible, costly sacrifice of the compass, earning the emotional shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is a lyrical archetype ("spirited driftwood sculptor") rather than a conflicted individual. There is no internal contradiction or difficult choice; the character acts as a vessel for the theme, succeeding at the task without doubt, struggle, or genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is a competent observer but lacks internal contradiction or psychological friction. The drive is aesthetic rather than personal or costly, and the absence of a distinct flaw or struggle results in a smooth, somewhat idealized trajectory. The "quietly driven" attribute is stated and acted upon, but without emotional stakes or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's "motive simple and ruinous" serves as a strong, compelling anchor that drives the narrative into danger rather than safety. While the grandmother functions effectively as a guide, she feels more symbolic than fully individuated, slightly softening the specific interpersonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iria is a strong, archetypal figure whose competence drives the narrative. Her internal state is well-defined by the "refusal of false comfort," though her interiority feels somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally vulnerable. The sailor serves as an effective, functional foil who validates her ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is vividly drawn, combining the weariness of a "venerable" functionary with a specific, traumatized interiority ("pin in my breath"). Motivation shifts organically from professional duty to ethical refusal, grounded in personal history. The internal conflict is palpable and distinct, though the final choice feels slightly eased by external cooperation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator is a competent functionary performing a ritual without hesitation, internal conflict, or risk of failure. The "furiously tranquil" trait appears as a label rather than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character voice and motivation are distinct, creating a clear "sage vs. rookie" dynamic that drives the scene. However, the attribute "credibly curious" is applied as an expository label rather than dramatized, creating a brief flicker of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("I am spiritually curious," "find strength in vulnerability") rather than demonstrated traits. While the voice is distinct, the self-awareness feels performed for the reader rather than embodied in the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is meticulously rendered, balancing the guilt of his former life ("broker of contracts") with his current penance. The contradiction between his instinct to survive and the necessity of accepting the "burning" frame drives a genuine psychological shift. His final choice to mark the sigil and accept the stings earns the transition from passive survivor to active custodian.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator is clearly defined as an archetype, but the internal landscape lacks friction; the &quot;borrowed heart&quot; constraint is mentioned but does not force difficult trade-offs in the scene. Lio functions more as a compliant tool for resolution than a distinct character with conflicting agency. The collaboration is frictionless, reducing the potential for character-driven drama.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetypal "magical helper" with no internal conflict, flaws, or development; his stance is fully crystallized from the first line. The emotional calibration is too perfect, with the boy accepting the esoteric lesson immediately, lacking the resistance or "embodied contradiction" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's acceptance of death is dignified, but the lack of internal conflict or doubt creates a somewhat idealized, static portrait. The emotional trajectory is smooth and linear, missing the jagged edges or contradictory impulses usually found in a character facing terminal decline; the "brazen calm" feels performed rather than hard-won against fear.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's specific voice ("lab bench rather than chapel pew") provides a distinct filter, but declared traits like "rebellion" and "skepticism" appear as labels rather than drivers of action. The character complies fully with the ritual without testing the constraints, resulting in a low-agency arc where the internal change feels intellectually observed rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.7)
    The coachman is a compelling atmospheric presence with a distinct history, but he lacks dramatized internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. He performs his ritual with settled certainty; the &quot;apology&quot; is stated as a motivation rather than felt through a struggle between past soldiering and present gardening during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is largely passive, relying on the dog to find the key object and a riddle to solve the mechanism, rather than driving action through difficult choices. The introduction relies on self-diagnostic labeling ("I am an intuitively descriptive ledger keeper"), which violates the show-don't-tell preference for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's "blessed pariah" duality creates immediate, complex interiority that informs every choice. The internal conflict is embodied well, though the transition from guilt to the final "devotion" feels slightly smoothed over by the reflective distance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic archetype rather than a grounded character; while the voice is consistent, the interiority relies on heavy metaphor ("learning by listening to astonishment") that distances the reader from visceral emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator functions as a lyrical vessel for the concept rather than a psychological agent under pressure; interiority is stylized ("braided my lungs") and static. The integration of the "crisis actor" backstory is grammatically awkward and feels like a raw prompt insertion rather than earned history. No contradictory impulses or difficult choices challenge the protagonist's "benevolent" stance, leaving the character arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict regarding their accent and buried talents provides a strong emotional anchor. However, the character remains somewhat reactive to the Seer's instructions, and the "shame-encyclopedias" moment feels slightly diagnostic rather than fully embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—ambition versus remorse—is masterfully drawn and inextricably linked to the plot. The backstory of the prince serves as a potent engine for the present choice, transforming a magical puzzle into a moral redemption arc. The decision to reject the "brilliant sacrifice" in favor of the "longer method" perfectly demonstrates character growth through action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's internal burden (theft) is legible, but his agency is diluted by the child, who functions as a convenient catalyst for the solution. The emotional landscape is conveyed through stylized metaphors ("eyes rubbed raw") rather than visceral, embodied reactions, keeping the characterization at a fable-like distance. The resolution of the artist's guilt feels unearned, as the "heavy" price is easily mitigated by the child's intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc from paralyzing doubt to "sharpened hope" is vividly dramatized through the interaction with the machine. Motivation is clear and visceral, grounded in specific guilt ("bolts she was counting counted her"). The choice to accept the "pattern" rather than the person marks a strong, earned psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—between the safety of "careful replicas" and the risk of the "salt ghosts"—is dramatized effectively through action rather than mere exposition. The inciting crack in the mirror and the subsequent journey create a tangible psychological arc that resolves with a meaningful shift in stance: the acceptance of the "split" rather than a repair. The choice to leave the perfection of the cave to return to the imperfect world demonstrates a high-stakes ethical and artistic maturation. The character feels distinct, grounded in a specific "nostalgic" weariness that justifies the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is well-defined with a consistent, lyrical worldview that motivates the central action. However, the character leans into the "magical wise child" archetype, and the motivation ("to prove that whispers travel farther") feels slightly performative and explanatory rather than purely embodied in the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, with the tension between mechanical obedience and grief driving the narrative arc. The decision to leave the station and the subsequent realization at the shelter constitute a meaningful change in stance (Earned Stasis/Acceptance) with visible emotional cost. The connection to Mara feels authentic and anchors the surreal elements in human loss.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's "rational" nature is effectively dramatized, not just labeled, particularly in the tactical decision to physically obscure the relic (using foraging skills) to navigate the constraint of involuntary verbal honesty. The internal conflict between the compulsion to speak truth and the need to protect the group creates a distinct, character-specific pressure that drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's voice is distinct ("softly persistent," "ledger of names") and the internal motivation to decode the gesture is compelling. However, the pivotal insight arrives via a "borrowed memory" that rises "unasked," which renders the protagonist passive at the climax of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between passive cataloging and active choosing is well-rendered and resolved through a decisive act of agency (reclaiming the chip). The choice to internalize the magic rather than succumb to it demonstrates strong character growth, though the opening "Lonely is not the right word" feels slightly standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is immediate and sharply defined, driving every beat from the opening sentence. The internal conflict—hunger for answers versus the "ghost of unasked questions"—is dramatized effectively in the final choice to wake the stone self. The "softly commanding" trait is well-integrated, showing rather than just telling her capacity for rule.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The characters are distinct, defined by a mix of "tease and devotion" that fits the high-concept premise. The narrator's internal landscape is rich, though the relentless figurative language sometimes creates a barrier to visceral emotional connection. The shared resolve effectively drives the ritual, and the relationship serves as a convincing crucible for the alchemical act.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and the "chronologically confused" trait informs worldview and choice organically. While the internal conflict is rich, the "jealousy" mechanic feels slightly instrumental—more a magic-system lever than a deeply embodied psychological flaw—rendering the protagonist somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, but the customer lacks a distinct voice, speaking in the same lyrical, metaphor-heavy register as the narrator ("silence turned to iron"). The dialogue feels performative rather than naturalistic, with characters delivering thematic thesis statements instead of conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary, blending professional competence ("crow quill," "ink") with personal vulnerability ("earnest errors"). The internal conflict is embodied specifically through the scars and the memories they evoke, avoiding generic angst. The realization that "apology is a kind of weatherwork" marks a profound, character-specific deepening of perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's specific role as a "gossip-column exorcist" is brilliantly integrated, converting a character flaw (scandal-mongering) into the climactic solution (blackmailing the foreman). Agency is high, and the internal pivot from seeking personal absolution to honoring the living is earned and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is a consistent mythic archetype, but interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts rather than embodied emotion. The shift from judge to listener is clear, but the agency is shared with the responsive setting (the stone, the hush), reducing the difficulty of the internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation to understand the true nature of time is compelling and sustains the narrative drive. The grandmother’s legacy adds necessary emotional weight, grounding the abstract clockwork in a personal history of "fear" and "heart." The internal shift from a technician of minutes to a shepherd of edges is earned through the on-page physical interaction with the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and the entanglement of her professional skills with her grief is compelling. However, the motivation relies heavily on explanatory interiority (e.g., “She was here because grief needed a system…”) rather than emerging solely through action. The "spatially gifted" trait feels more like a declared label than a deeply dramatized cognitive mode in the earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and consistent, effectively blending academic precision with grief. However, the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic self-labeling ("I am the compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter") and aphoristic thought patterns that feel performed rather than embodied. The emotional arc is clear, but the characterization feels slightly constructed to serve the thematic thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract thematic labels ("cultivated estrangement," "listening without wanting") rather than embodied emotion. While her choice to intervene shows agency, the emotional texture is often distanced by poetic filtering rather than felt directly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archivist’s voice is distinct and consistent, but the "haunted euphoria" remains a told label rather than an embodied, contradictory state. The woman serves primarily as a vessel for the theme, lacking agency beyond the initial request, and the emotional resolution feels slightly unearned by character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    The logistician acts as a functional archetype for the fable mode but lacks internal contradiction or embodied friction; the "desperately jocular" trait is stated as a label rather than dramatized through difficult, high-pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is meticulously rendered, physically grounding abstract grief in "dry estuary mud" and "skin" sensation. The motivation to navigate emotional depths is active, not passive, driving the dowsing; the realization that the map is "marrow" feels earned by the sensory labor on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s internal conflict—past agricultural failure versus present celestial duty—is beautifully rendered. The motivation to "thresh meaning" from guilt drives the climax naturally. The "confidently uncertain" trait provides a distinct, consistent filter for the character's worldview and final resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.0)
    Arin functions as a lyrical archetype rather than a fully realized protagonist; internal contradiction and embodied difficulty are largely absent. The advisor serves as a convenient guide who removes doubt ("Do not force melody") rather than complicating the choice, lowering the psychological stakes. The lack of distinct, friction-filled interiority leaves the emotional arc feeling asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's competence relies heavily on the "analytically intuitive" label, which functions as a "tell" rather than a dramatized trait to bypass intellectual struggle. While the motivation to preserve memory is clear, the interiority feels abstract and slightly melodramatic ("heart steaming") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to save Mira is compelling, and the acceptance of the "strangers" at the end marks a distinct shift in stance. However, traits like "quietly rebellious" are stated rather than dramatized through pressure, and the internal conflict regarding the donor memories is resolved with an assertion rather than a struggle, reducing the visceral weight of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Ivo is a competent archetype (the wise workman) who executes a task flawlessly, but he lacks interior contour, doubt, or contradictory impulses. The narrative functions as "competence porn," offering satisfaction but missing the embodied cost or difficult choice required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrator's internal grief is embodied well, but the Guardian functions more as a magical archetype than a fully realized character. The emotional resolution feels slightly unearned due to the lack of interpersonal friction; the connection is instant and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrator functions as a thematic mouthpiece rather than a realized character; there is no internal contradiction, blind spot, or struggle. The "rebellion" executes perfectly without interpersonal friction or doubt, leaving the protagonist with no arc other than successful instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, blending toughness ("hardshell") with hidden grace. However, the internal conflict resolves somewhat smoothly; the struggle to "name" oneself feels inevitable rather than fraught with doubt, and the emotional arc lacks the grit of genuine hesitation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator is a compelling study in necessary duplicity, balancing compliance with a deep, embodied resistance. The "blank face" is not just a trait but a survival mechanism that enables the final act of subversion. The internal contradiction—performing neutrality while cultivating a "remade hush"—drives the narrative voice and choices with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "cloud-shadow poet" functions more as a symbolic archetype than a fully realized character with internal conflict; their motivation is stated in backstory rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The collective "we" and the weeping guard serve as props for the ceremony rather than agents of resistance, resulting in a cast that feels like a pageant rather than people under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ivo serves primarily as a lyrical vessel for the theme rather than a psychological entity with distinct friction; his "innocently cunning" trait is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through complex choices. The lack of internal resistance to the life-changing decision to "stay" flattens his arc into a smooth, conflict-free transition. While his sensory worldview is consistent, he lacks the contradictory impulses that drive high-stakes characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype (the mystical healer) who faces no internal contradiction or meaningful risk; the "powerfully gentle" trait is asserted twice but never tested by a situation requiring force or difficult restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is rich, but the dialogue drifts into diagnostic thematic speech ("intention honors even the broken plans"), which reads more like an authorial thesis than a character interaction. The transition from jeweler to "tutor" is stated elegantly but relies on abstract motivation rather than dramatized psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    The archetypal roles (Mentor/Apprentice) fit the fable-like mode well, and the cartomancer’s worldview is coherent and distinct. However, the characters remain relatively static; while the narrator participates more by the end, there is no deep internal conflict or "crucible" moment that forces a difficult choice or transformation beyond competent execution of the trade.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator serves as a lyrical cipher for the theme rather than a grounded protagonist; interiority is conveyed almost exclusively through metaphor ("doubt to learn new knees") rather than embodied emotion. While the motivation ("hunger of drought") is stated, the lack of visceral, contradictory impulses or costly hesitation makes the character feel archetypal rather than human. The interaction with the child is symbolic, lacking the friction of genuine relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira demonstrates clear agency in the climax, making a sacrifice that carries thematic weight. However, her characterization leans heavily on archetypal "magical librarian" tropes, and her internal conflict is minimal until the final bargain; the "sorrow" she feels is somewhat abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrator is fully realized, with the tension between "gentle" professional identity and "shaking" internal anger driving the scene. The choice to channel rage into precision is a distinct, character-defining move that feels earned. The internal conflict is embodied in physical action, satisfying the highest standard for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (survivor's guilt vs. desire for truth) is compelling, but characterization relies heavily on direct labeling ("I am a closure seeker who opens wounds," "I am accidentally telepathic"). These expository declarations flatten the emotional discovery, presenting traits as a bio-sheet rather than dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vividly rendered, particularly the visualization of feelings as spatial structures. The pivot from observer to participant is earned, though the emotional realization regarding "shyness" leans slightly into sentimental archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype functioning as a vessel for the concept rather than a realized character; the label "moonstruck dreamer" replaces specific personality traits. Motivation is explicitly stated ("silence was digging a grave") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. There is no internal contradiction or palpable cost to the "healing" work; the interaction with the sculptor lacks genuine status dynamics or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist is a perfectly calibrated vessel for this surreal ecology, defined by a specific competence ("cultivate the sparks") and a melancholic cost ("dreamless"). The internal consistency is high, with the guard's choices—silence, humming, the specific move in the game—stemming directly from their established motive. The emotional landscape is stark but embodied, fitting the "dreamless" state without feeling flat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a poetic observer, with motivation largely abstract ("hum of insight") until the ending exposition explains it via the notebook. The central choice to repair the gear is driven by a desire to stop an "ache" rather than a dramatized, character-specific struggle, limiting emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist lacks specific, embodied humanity, functioning instead as a passive vessel for the allegory. The &quot;leash&quot; remains an abstract floating signifier without a concrete backstory or relationship to ground the emotional stakes. The characters are archetypes who face no genuine internal contradiction; the protagonist simply obeys the guides' instructions without meaningful resistance or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist is defined primarily by lyrical interiority rather than embodied action; while the motivation to heal is clear, the emotional stakes are often intellectualized through metaphor ("pain made a metronome of me"). The choice to "remain" provides agency, but the character feels more like a vessel for the prose style than a distinct individual making hard choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lyr is a compelling, specific archetype whose quiet competence anchors the fable-like tone effectively. However, Serane functions more as a plot device than a fully realized antagonist; her transition from regal arrogance to tearful abdication is too smooth and lacks the friction of genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's specific background as a "coral bleaching witness" effectively grounds their observational skills, translating well into the rhythm-based solution. Interiority is distinct and reflective, though the transition from observer to community savior relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to find meaning in the mess—is clear and consistent, driving her interaction with the setting. The connection to her father provides a solid emotional anchor, though her "awkwardly confident" trait feels more like a descriptive label than a driver of difficult choices. The "cost" she pays is primarily sensory (heat, vibration) rather than a painful character trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lida is a compelling protagonist with a specifically drawn interiority ("shrapnel and sap") that informs her worldview. Her motivation to "evolve tradition" rather than destroy it is nuanced and drives her agency effectively. The antagonist (the council) is slightly passive, summarized rather than fully dramatized in the confrontation, which keeps the pressure from maxing out.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rafi’s interiority is poignant, anchoring the trauma in specific sensory details like the "bodies crowded the edges" of the photo. However, the use of the diagnostic phrase "somatic markers" during the peak emotional beat (the gull rescue) creates a clinical distance that filters the immediate sensation of the "loosening" shoulders, slightly flattening the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and her transition from burnout to guardianship is earned through the tactile action of the wick-making. The motivation is slightly abstract ("hands into moths"), but the emotional logic holds and the renunciation of her old tools for a new purpose carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a voice and motivation that drive the narrative. The refusal at the climax ("taming is a kind of theft") is a strong character-specific choice that earns the resolution. However, the explicit labeling of traits ("serene anger," "consciously wild") relies on telling rather than purely dramatizing internal states, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s internal landscape is rich, and the desire to disrupt the silence is compelling. However, the use of the diagnostic label "bravely conflicted" creates a "tell" moment that flattens the emotional nuance, and the protagonist's complete safety at the end reduces the weight of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is distinct and embodied ("hands remember restraint"), but her composure is so absolute that the scene lacks the friction of genuine internal struggle or formidable opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's "cool-headed" nature is actively deconstructed ("calm is a net you mend every hour"), revealing internal effort. Motivation is clear and noble, driving the renunciation at the climax. The choice to release the map is earned by the established character trait of being a "listener" rather than a conqueror.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to discover hidden truths") is perfectly married to her specific background ("proofreading margins"), driving the plot through a character-specific test (the wager). Her internal conflict between observation and intervention resolves in a decisive, costly choice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (guilt vs. evasion) is compelling, and the motivation to "hush the dissonance" drives the narrative effectively. However, the backstory of leaving "a girl whose laugh had not yet begun" relies on generic tropes of the brooding, regretful artist. The interiority is often abstract ("eyes like weather"), prioritizing poetic distance over grounded psychological specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrator relies on diagnostic self-labeling ("I was a whimsical chalk artist," "I am socially perceptive") rather than demonstrating these traits organically. This "telling" creates distance and feels artificial, particularly the clumsy justification for the intervention. The protagonist faces little genuine internal struggle, functioning more as a facilitator who easily resolves the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic delivery system than a living character under pressure. Motivation is delivered via diagnostic label-speak ("My motivation is simple... to cradle empathy") rather than dramatized desire. The narrator faces no genuine internal cost or doubt; their "aberrant mercy" is applied procedurally without psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator functions effectively as a witness but lacks deep internal conflict or distinct agency beyond the caretaking role. The ghost feels archetypal, and their dynamic creates a gentle symbiosis rather than the pressurized "crucible" required for high-stakes character drama.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a distinct presence, and the "affectionate skeptic" dynamic grounds the relationship effectively in the crucible of the procedure. However, the skepticism is largely internal and overcome without significant resistance on the page; her compliance is immediate, making the trait feel more like a label than a driver of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist is defined by a distinct, high-concept motivation ("voice of the unknown") that drives specific, costly on-page choices (leaving the fossil). The internal posture of "negotiation" rather than "ownership" is rigorously maintained. While the character is somewhat archetypal, their agency in the climax—choosing the contract over safety—elevates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal arc from passive measurer to active interpreter is compelling and lyrically rendered. While the motivation is deeply felt in the voice ("theft feels like a vow"), the character functions slightly more as a poetic archetype than a friction-tested individual, with few flaws impeding their progress.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ansel is a distinct, well-rendered focalizer with clear internal scarring and motivation. However, his interiority occasionally drifts into abstract poetic labeling ("unused courage waits," "equation of inches") rather than grounded psychological texture, slightly distancing the reader from the visceral cost of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characters function as lyrical vessels for the prompt's vocabulary rather than fully realized individuals; the coachman's reliance on "ambient awareness" reads as an inserted mechanic rather than a distinct trait. Motivation is abstract ("deliver what mattered") and lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence with no internal conflict, flaws, or contradictory impulses. While she performs the ritual beautifully, she faces no difficult choices or doubts, resulting in a static character arc that lacks dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s dual identity as a gardener and a lockmaster’s child provides a unique, cohesive filter for their interaction with the world. The internal motivation—honoring the mother while connecting with the father’s skill—is palpable and drives the action. The gardening metaphor is not just ornamental; it dictates how the character approaches the mechanical problem of the lock ("coax," "thaw") and resolves the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist's non-human identity (tusks, herd memory) is masterfully integrated, grounding the surreal setting in physical weight and instinct. The choice to sing the "herd song" serves as a distinct, character-specific resolution to the crisis. The explicit declaration of motivation ("My motivation is...") is the only slight lapse in an otherwise shown, not told, internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrator functions as a lyrical archetype rather than a flesh-and-blood character, lacking internal contradiction or struggle. Motivation is declared ("I wanted to find the thread") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or potential failure. The "keeper of secrets" persona remains a static label, and the emotional stakes for the narrator are low, as the plan succeeds without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist possesses distinct interiority and agency, acting as a competent "custodian" who uses professional skills to resolve the plot. The refusal of the tenure bribe is a character-defining choice with visible cost ("breakfast without chair"), grounding the cosmic conflict in personal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's specific traits ("claustrophobic explorer," "prudently adventurous") are established early and drive the choice of tools (chalk, compass), creating a consistent internal logic. However, the claustrophobia reads more as a declared label than a visceral constraint; the narrator navigates tight spaces with a smoothness that minimizes the felt cost of the condition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's condition (prosopagnosia) is effectively integrated into their methodology ("riverbeds," "postures"), creating a distinct worldview. However, the motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" feels asserted rather than embodied, and the character acts more as a thematic vessel than a person facing a costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives the scene, but the specific attribute "nervously confident" reads more as a label than a dramatized conflict; the confidence is absolute, the nervousness invisible in the choices. The antagonist is a flat archetype ("eyes are two dry prunes") who offers no genuine interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator is defined primarily by their role and aesthetic function rather than deep interiority; the connection to the hitchhiker feels asserted through "code" and "jokes" rather than dramatized emotional weight. While the "bridge-song" concept is compelling, the hitchhiker's return resolves with a lack of interpersonal friction, making the relationship feel more like a plot device than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator is distinct, with a consistent voice and clear, if abstract, motivation ("discover why some paths circle back"). However, the character remains largely reactive to the investors and the market, observing the rise and fall rather than driving the events through active scene-level choices. The "highway robber's son" persona adds texture but feels more like a costume for a thematic cipher than a fully embodied protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator's motivation is clear, but the voices of the two characters converge into a single high-literary register, lacking distinction. The protagonist relies on diagnostic self-definition ("I heal with words") rather than dramatizing that trait through difficult choices or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is a distinct, competent professional with a clear voice and agency. The "guarded heart" arc offers a subtle internal shift, though the "warlike serenity" trait leans slightly on stylized description rather than deep, simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "root-bound" constraint efficiently physicalizes the character's role, grounding the visionary voice in a tangible limitation. While the emotional interiority is sometimes subsumed by the dense metaphorical register, the protagonist's choices are active and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist possesses a distinct, lyrical voice and a clear motivation rooted in grief. However, the character functions more as an archetype than a deeply conflicted individual; the "reckless idealist" label is self-applied rather than dramatized through risky errors, as the magical transaction proceeds smoothly with only poetic costs.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between professional detachment and grief is palpable and distinct. The shift from "insulating with facts" to the vulnerability of the final appraisal is an earned emotional arc, grounded in specific, embodied memories of the lost friend. The backstory serves the present psychological state effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator's specific expertise as a translator defines their perception and tactical choices, creating a unique internal landscape. The shift from "haunted ambitions" to accepting a role as a "comma" represents an earned, character-specific resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is an aesthetic function ("hinge-hearted," "clockwork shoulders") rather than a psychological agent, performing a routine duty without internal conflict. The interaction with the visitor is a smooth transaction that lacks a crucible; no "contradictory impulses" or difficult micro-choices appear to test the character's stated motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a lyrical vessel for the theme than a grounded character under pressure; the central choice lacks friction as the impulse to "dissolve walls" is innate and unopposed. While the "vow of silence" suggests a tradeoff, the ending is purely euphoric, missing the "felt cost" or genuine struggle required for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s professional rigidity (“daringly methodical”) contrasting with their grief-induced unraveling creates strong internal pressure. The backstory of the “tidy creed” modeling error perfectly motivates the present guilt and the specific nature of the penance, earning the final emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is a consistent poetic voice ("veiled dreamer"), but lacks visceral interiority or defined flaws beyond the prompt's setup. The "lie I regretted" is a compelling hook that remains abstract and unconnected to the final choice, leaving the character feeling more like a vessel for imagery than a person making difficult decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ilya is a compelling focalizer whose internal conflict—archivist vs. memory-keeper—drives the narrative. The "accidental telepathy" is seamlessly woven into his worldview rather than feeling like a superpower, grounding his motivation to listen to the plants over the empire. The final choice to destroy the violin is a deeply earned renunciation of his professional safety for a higher fidelity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is competent and reflective, with an internal state that mirrors the setting's stillness. However, the emotional arc is linear and lacks a moment of jagged contradiction or costly choice; she remains professionally composed throughout, making the "remaking" at the end feel slightly unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist functions more as a mythic archetype than a psychological agent, lacking internal conflict or doubt. She enters "kindly decisive" and remains so, performing tasks without struggle; the lack of contradictory impulses or blind spots makes her feel functional rather than human.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lark’s internal conflict is expertly externalized through the narrator's role, and her final choice to "speak and set terms" feels earned rather than dictated. The "sincerely insincere" trait is dramatized effectively through her confession strategy, showing a character who weaponizes vulnerability without losing authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a passive vessel for the lesson, complying with instructions ("I let the stone slide," "I agreed") without significant on-page resistance or internal friction. While the researcher is a compelling archetype, the narrator's emotional arc lacks the embodied struggle required to make the final renunciation feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, grounded in a specific "harmonic" craft that informs every observation. The internal motivation ("navigate without moving") is abstract but consistently dramatized through action (stillness, breathing). A stronger sense of personal cost or fallibility beyond mere patience would elevate the emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is deep and character-specific ("lid someone else screwed on"); the protagonist's redefinition of failure into attention is a fully earned arc that drives the story.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the transition from hiding to admitting desire is a clear emotional arc. However, the pivotal trait ("hides behind truth") is delivered via diagnostic exposition rather than dramatized behavior, and the motivation ("color of sound") remains abstract, lacking visceral grounding until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal conflict regarding their title ("abdication" vs. "causality ran uphill") provides a solid emotional anchor. Sori serves a functional role and is defined largely by the prompt label rather than distinct agency. The shift from shame to acceptance feels earned through the ritual, though the resolution comes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation—atoning for a past failure by naming fears—is deeply embodied and drives every on-page action. The internal conflict between his "useless tenderness" and the clinical necessity of his work is palpable, culminating in a choice that integrates his grief into a new vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.7)
    Efan is a consistent, archetypal protagonist who fits the fable-like tone, but he lacks deep internal friction or contradictory impulses on the page. His "earnest naivety" is stated more than dramatized through difficult trade-offs; he performs the ritual without genuine doubt or personal cost, functioning primarily as a vessel for the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and noble, grounded in a specific role ("precisely humane"). However, the internal landscape relies partly on stock phrasing ("ache he cannot place") and the "mentor's voice" device resolves the internal conflict a bit too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and thematic, but the protagonist functions more as a ritual implement than a person under pressure. Emotional interiority relies on labels ("secretly sentimental") rather than embodied reaction, and the internal conflict is resolved with a poise that feels unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's history with the pilot (the scar) effectively raises the stakes beyond the immediate task, creating a tangible "relationship as crucible." However, the interiority relies too heavily on self-diagnostic labeling ("preserve trust under pressure") rather than letting the tension speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to defeat emotional numbness") is stated clearly but resolved somewhat cleanly through the ritual's success rather than a high-cost personal struggle. While the narrator functions effectively as a witness and judge, Neri and Rae serve primarily as symbolic archetypes (soft vs. sharp) to facilitate the thematic argument rather than as fully realized individuals with internal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is legible, but she lacks internal friction; her alignment with the story's theme is too perfect, rendering her a vessel for the message rather than a conflicted agent. She accepts the seed's risk without genuine struggle, and her reactions ("laughed softly") feel idealized rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is a vivid archetype with a clear goal and symbolic resonance, fitting the fable-like tone. However, he functions more as a magical device than a complex character; his internal landscape is defined by the prompt's "mournfully eager" label rather than conflicting impulses or deep psychological choices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s internal state (“dimensionally homesick”) is distinct and deeply felt, grounding the surreal premise in emotional reality. The guardian is vividly characterized through sensory details (“smells of vellum and salt”) rather than exposition. The interaction reveals a coherent dynamic of test and acceptance, though the motivation is stated a bit too explicitly in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and the internal landscape is rich, though "stoically sensitive" acts more as a self-applied label than a trait tested by difficult choice. The protagonist's agency is high, but the emotional arc feels slightly insulated by the reflective, poetic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator functions effectively as a vessel for the premise but lacks deep interiority or contradiction. The interaction with the grandmother and other voices relies on sentimental shorthand ("listen without keeping") rather than individuated character work. The "laughter" at the end feels performative rather than earned by emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    The deckhand's internal desire for arrival drives the narrative effectively against the surreal backdrop. The final choice to embrace the "undertow" of the tide over a static paradise represents a clear, character-driven resolution with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist and curator function as effective philosophical archetypes, but they lack the internal contradictions or visceral desires of fully embodied characters. The visitor serves as a convenient prop for the climax rather than an agent of pressure, limiting the complexity of the cast dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal contradiction—teaching safe navigation while longing for the dangerous, lost sky—is visceral and drives the narrative. The choice to reject the city's lamps for the "night crawls" demonstrates agency with clear physical and psychological cost. The final stance is a profound, earned reconfiguration of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is a compelling, empathetic vessel for the story's high-concept premise. The internal drive ("persistently curious") motivates the break from protocol, and the moment of realization regarding the "habit of tenderness" demonstrates strong perceptual depth. The interaction with the father reveals genuine emotional stakes, anchoring the surrealism in human grief.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between claustrophobia and compulsion is visceral, driving micro-choices with legible cost. The arc from "unseen intern" to a witness who "stands" is earned through the physical ordeal and the final renunciation of the gold fleck. Backstory serves the present moment, deepening the stakes of the return without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is strong, anchored by the compulsive heartbeat counting which effectively dramatizes the protagonist's trauma. The "death certificate error" provides a unique entry point, though it functions more as a label than a driver of tactical choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal dedication to the craft drives the narrative, culminating in a significant sacrifice (the name) that feels earned. While the "copper-veined" trait remains largely ornamental, the "quietly articulate" attribute is effectively operationalized as a tactical approach to the canyon's acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's arc from undercover operative to "keeper" is compelling and integrates well with the setting's pressures. While the internal transformation is earned, the specific motivation of turning bitterness into a "cosmic joke" feels slightly abstract and declarative rather than demonstrated through earlier tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal Artist rather than a fully realized individual; motivation is singular and lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required for depth. While the dedication is clear, the character operates more as a vehicle for the theme than a person making difficult, costly choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is distinct, but Mina functions largely as a mouthpiece for the theme, delivering lines like "We keep trying to fill each other when we should be linking the holes." This didactic dialogue flattens the interaction into a philosophical lesson rather than a genuine human exchange, reducing character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions as a competent archetype ("silent carpenter") rather than a fully realized character with internal contradictions. While the choice to sing acts as a turning point, the difficulty or cost of this renunciation is stated ("chose to sing") rather than dramatized through hesitation or struggle. The emotional landscape is perfectly calibrated to the fable tone, lacking the friction or irrationality of a human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, grounded in a specific worldview that blends science and poetry. Interiority is vivid, though it occasionally drifts into stylized abstraction ("logic of breath") rather than embodied emotion. The desire is clear, driving the ritualistic action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's role as a guardian of the surreal is distinct, and the motivation to "escort" rather than "own" the dream drives the narrative arc. However, the emotional landscape is somewhat abstract, relying on atmospheric longing rather than visceral, embodied interiority. The shift in stance from hunter to witness is earned, though the character functions more as an archetypal vessel than a psychologically deep individual.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist possesses a clear, poignant internal conflict (desire vs. fear) rooted in specific memory. Interiority is vivid, though the protagonist is somewhat reactive, following the locksmith's instructions rather than driving the process through independent agency until the final vocalization.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—ambition versus relationship—is dramatized effectively through the ritual confession ("loved the work more than the woman"). The "anchor rope" metaphor specifically grounds the relationship history in the setting, though the distinction between the grandmother and the "woman" initially feels slightly ambiguous before clarifying.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "walking backwards" trait is successfully integrated into the climax as a tactical move, which is a strength. However, the protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("heat in my chest") rather than grounded emotion, and the child functions more as a symbolic prop than a character.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    Miren functions as a purely competent archetype without internal contradiction or struggle; her choices meet no resistance and require no personal sacrifice, resulting in a lack of character depth. The absence of flaws or doubts makes her agency feel functional rather than dramatic, as she solves the central problem effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist displays high professional competence, but interiority relies on poetic observation ("needle drank the room") rather than visceral, conflicted emotion. The "cost" of the restoration is stated metaphorically ("weighed them with stones") rather than dramatized through personal vulnerability or sacrifice. The character functions more as a lyrical observer than an agent under deep pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's "shielded openness" and professional curiosity create a distinct, consistent voice that anchors the fable-like tone. Motivation is clear and drives the investigation, though the lack of significant internal conflict or difficult trade-offs limits the character depth. The verger serves as a functional foil, highlighting the protagonist's gentle persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's internal state is legible, but the "analytic" trait feels at odds with the highly poetic, romantic voice. The use of the cliché "Death and I were on a first name basis" functions as a shortcut for characterization rather than a demonstrated behavior, slightly flattening the persona.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transition from a hired articulate to a "hinge" for the city's pain is a strong, earned arc. The internal motivation ("thirst that had learned to sing quietly") is lyrical and consistent, though the "seldom-heard" trait operates more as a label than a constraint on specific choices until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is an idealized observer lacking internal contradiction or flaw; their "affectionate detachment" precludes genuine struggle. The character functions as a vehicle for the prose rather than an agent making difficult choices with visible costs. The emotional arc is serene and declared rather than dramatized through friction or error.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's specific worldview—reading weather as emotion—is established immediately and maintained with rigorous consistency. The internal conflict between technical precision and emotional intuition drives the voice, though the calm lyrical detachment slightly dampens the sense of physical peril.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prosopagnosia is woven effectively into the artist’s perception ("shoulders confess more than eyes"), grounding their specific method. However, the internal arc of "learning limits" feels instructed by the letter rather than discovered through costly error or genuine struggle, making the character's growth feel slightly procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich and specific ("wake with compass dust"), establishing a clear vocational drive. However, the pivotal interaction with the helmsman lacks interpersonal friction; trust is "lent as one might lend a match," making the success feel low-cost and the status dynamics under-utilized.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype functioning as a vessel for the setting rather than a fully realized character. There is no internal contradiction or struggle; his success is pre-ordained by prophecy and competence, lacking a moment of genuine vulnerability or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    The collective "we" relies heavily on summary ("We argued," "We feasted") rather than dramatized scene work, flattening individual agency and internal conflict. The characters function as a passive hive mind responding to external directions without distinct friction or personal cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's agency is clear and distinct, moving from maintenance to a defined act of mercy (singing). The "mother's songs" backstory serves as a functional anchor for the character's unique methodology. Internal conflict is somewhat stylized ("bruised awe") rather than kinetically contradictory, but the final choice to "fail singing" is earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's resignation to duty creates a solid, albeit somewhat static, emotional baseline. While the "reluctant caretaker" role is fulfilled, the internal cost of staying feels more narrated ("duty had settled like a thorned halo") than dramatized through a hesitant micro-choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s guilt is embodied well in the specific memory of the "barbed tatters," and the motivation to atone drives the narrative. However, the trait "symphonically minded" is asserted rather than shown through prior behavior, making the musical metaphors during the epiphany feel slightly imposed rather than organic to the character's baseline thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype functioning as a vessel for the concept; while the sacrifice of "unfinishedness" attempts a cost, the lack of internal contradiction or hesitation limits emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("sandpaper rough memories") is distinct and drives the narrative logic effectively. Interiority is rich and embodied ("mouth full of borrowed thunder"), though the Chef's competence dampens the sense of personal risk during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("harmonious," "vigorously tender") rather than revealed through choices under pressure. She faces no internal conflict or external resistance, functioning as a static archetype who succeeds by definition rather than struggle. The attribute "empathetically decisive" is used to summarize her competence instead of dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's specific "helix-minded" nature is integrated well into their problem-solving methodology, giving them a distinct approach. However, emotional interiority relies too heavily on abstract metaphors (e.g., "calm panic," "circuits of my fear") rather than embodied reaction or visceral feeling. This distancing effect makes the character feel more like a lyrical construct than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "prism-minded" voice is distinct and consistent, establishing a strong archetypal presence that fits the fable-like tone. However, the protagonist functions more as a proficient operator of the surreal mechanics than a vulnerable character; their expertise feels absolute, leaving little room for internal conflict or deeply felt emotional cost beyond abstract pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator acts as an archetypal vessel rather than a distinct individual; the internal pivot ("surrendering cleverness") feels smooth and lacks the friction of genuine cost. The quadruple repetition of the thematic phrase ("empathy in motion") in interiority flattens emotional authenticity into a label.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal voice is distinct, and the bond with the girl is drawn with delicate, lyrical precision. However, the connection is immediate and frictionless; the lack of interpersonal resistance or misunderstanding makes the dynamic feel slightly idealized rather than tested by the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator is defined by self-labels ("eclectic pacifist," "reluctant performer") rather than dramatized internal conflict. While the motivation to open the diary is clear, the character faces no genuine internal obstacle or difficult choice; their competence is absolute, and the emotional cost of the action is stated ("throat tightens") rather than felt through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal arc from ambition to stewardship is clear and thematically resonant. However, the &quot;ambition&quot; is stated more than dramatized; the choice to plant the seed feels like a natural step rather than a painful trade-off against a competing desire, limiting the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator is competent and the connection to the grandmother adds necessary weight, grounding the quest in lineage. However, the pilot remains somewhat functional, overcoming obstacles with expertise rather than character-defining struggle or internal conflict. The emotional landscape is described ("heart tight") rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s professional ethos is compelling, grounding the investigation in a clear internal philosophy ("foresight is not vision but practiced posture"). However, the interaction with the child relies on a functional "adult economy" trope, and the mid-crisis lecture on vectors feels slightly staged, reducing naturalism in the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a ritualistic archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking deep internal contradiction or gritty flaws. The moment of doubt is summarized ("Sometimes the bell ringer faltered") rather than dramatized, and the abstract motivation ("to certify wonder") creates little emotional friction or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation to repair a past failure is palpable and drives the narrative effectively. Interiority is rich, though the shift from pride to humility feels slightly expository in the realization beat ("The answer came slowly, woven of miscounts..."). The emotional arc is solid, but the resolution relies more on a stated internal shift than a forced, costly choice between difficult options.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s compulsion to "borrow personalities" functions brilliantly as both a magical mechanic and a character flaw, culminating in a resonant self-confrontation. The internal arc—from using Maris’s ghost as a shield to admitting the use of ambiguity for protection—creates a satisfying, earned deepening. Emotional contradictions are embodied in the physical work of the press, grounding the abstract "mathematics of emotion" in tangible action. The "Maris" persona serves as a distinct, actionable constraint that shapes the scene’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, but the "jittery" trait is stated rather than dramatized; it is overcome instantly by professional competence, removing potential tension. The character acts as a steady vessel for the concept rather than a flawed individual struggling under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s voice is distinct, grounded in a specific worldview ("attentive mystic") that drives the action. Mara functions effectively as a skeptical foil, though her conversion relies heavily on external visual proof rather than internal pressure, making her arc feel slightly reactive to the magic. The emotional resonance of her grief is well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kio's motivation is clear and poetic, but her interiority is often submerged under heavy lyrical abstraction rather than grounded emotion. The "cost" of her magic ("thin herself") is stated as a metaphysical rule rather than dramatized through visceral struggle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Iven functions as a fable archetype—the virtuous, competent craftsman—rather than a psychologically distinct character. The collective "we" POV creates distance that prevents access to his internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his "cost" (trading memories) is observed externally rather than felt through embodied emotion or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s sensory-focused interiority ("maps are not lines, but scents") drives the narrative logic and emotional resolution flawlessly. The shift from investigator to perpetrator is handled with earned maturity, leading to a sophisticated integration of guilt that feels specific to this character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator is introspective and voice-driven but lacks dramatized internal contradiction or struggle; the competence displayed conflicts with the negligence of ignoring the dead lamp. The "keeper" persona feels idealized and static, serving as a vessel for poetic observation rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The emotional arc is told through abstract summaries ("luminescent ache") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic cipher rather than a grounded character; motivation is abstract ("shape a new dawn") and lacks visceral, embodied cost. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; the character possesses a static, sage-like certainty that removes the possibility of difficult choices or earned growth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—between the dye master's urge to manipulate (using the wing) and the donor heart's urge to listen—is beautifully dramatized. The realization that magnetism is "posture" rather than greed provides a distinct, earned psychological shift that reconfigures their role from experimenter to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's specific role as a maintenance worker frames the magical elements through a grounded, labor-oriented lens, giving the "grief" motivation tactile weight. The internal consistency between the mechanical job and the spiritual longing is excellent. The emotional arc resolves cleanly through the "measured grief" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrator’s motivation is clear and drives the accumulation of elements, but the characterization remains somewhat archetypal. While the "scattered" nature and "scars" are mentioned, they feel more like symbolic attributes than embodied internal conflicts or gritty emotional costs on the page. The interaction with the twin adds depth but functions largely as a mirror for the concept rather than a relationship with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    Internal motivation is clear, but the protagonist relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("keenly empathetic listening," "soothing looked like taking sides") rather than dramatized interaction. Voice convergence is a significant issue; the counterpart speaks in the exact same metaphorical register as the narrator, flattening the cast into a single poetic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is characterized immediately by a diagnostic label ("creeping normality noticer") rather than action, which creates an abstract distance. While the internal voice is consistent, the interaction with the woman lacks friction or distinct interpersonal texture; they align instantly in shared mourning without navigating a complex emotional hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's transformation from "orderly records chief" to "guardian of resonances" is a lucid, earned arc. The internal drive "to conjure meaning" perfectly motivates the risk taken with the cracked slide, leading to a closure where the cost—becoming the archive's hinge—is embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lark is competent and the backstory grounds her skills ("read like tide tables"), but her core motivation ("collecting human weather") remains abstract and aesthetic, lacking visceral urgency. Her emotional distance keeps the stakes theoretical, as she operates more as a catalytic observer than a vulnerable participant.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is passive, primarily observing rather than driving the scene; their skepticism is stated but collapses immediately without dramatized resistance. Mirelle and the narrator share an identical, highly metaphorical voice, erasing necessary contrast between skeptic and believer.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and the internal conflict between commercial survival and "wild" creativity is clear. However, motivation is often delivered through dense metaphorical summary ("uncork suppressed creativity," "economy of survival") rather than purely embodied action/reaction, making the interiority feel slightly constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's specific physical reaction to lies (wilting) provides a unique, embodied constraint that drives the central conflict. The shift from individual refusal to a collective strike demonstrates strong agency and character growth under pressure. The motivation—a hunger for lost conversations—coheres perfectly with the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iri is a clear, motivated protagonist with a distinct role, but her internal landscape is somewhat static. The conflict is external and resolved through competence rather than a difficult choice or personal cost; the Keepers function more as symbolic foils than fully realized antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending "rubberized" physicality with an evocative "low snow of memory." The internal arc mirrors the external crisis perfectly, leading to a sophisticated emotional realization about the nature of care. The sacrifice of the tin contents feels like a genuine cost to the nostalgic persona.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist functions as a competent vehicle for the theme rather than a character under pressure; she begins and ends with the same wisdom, facing no internal blind spots or risk of failure. The &quot;choice&quot; to use the hairpin arrives as a sudden intuition (&quot;pulsed like a small directive&quot;) rather than a hard-won decision, and her role as &quot;curator&quot; feels idealized, lacking the friction or flaws that drive high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.5)
    The characters function primarily as vessels for the story's dense metaphorical style rather than as grounded individuals. While Mara is described with evocative labels ("lyrical code breaker"), her actions operate on dream logic rather than human motivation. The narrator's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract analysis ("cataloging my fear in careful lines") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator's interiority is deeply realized, grounding the fantastical elements in a palpable sense of loss ("missing parts of my sister"). The shift from personal grief to a broader understanding of their role as a "keeper" is earned through the interaction with the memory traces. The voice is distinct and authoritative, though the emotional resolution feels slightly rapid given the depth of the initial longing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The summoner is a competent, focused protagonist with a clear goal, fitting the mythic tone well. However, they lack internal conflict or significant flaws; their success feels inevitable and frictionless, lacking the "felt cost" or difficult micro-choices required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character motivations are poetic and consistent, fitting the magical realism frame well. However, the voices converge significantly; the tutor's dialogue mimics the narrator's internal monologue so closely that they read as the same consciousness, lacking distinct idiom or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator is clearly defined as a "charmed skeptic," and the internal motivation is consistent. However, the emotional arc feels somewhat abstract; the decision to accept the "winter" is made without significant on-page struggle or hesitation, making the character feel more like a functional vessel for the concept than a deeply conflicted individual.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is a coherent vessel for the theme, but their internal struggle is largely retrospective rather than dramatized in the moment. The decision to "forgive" appears predetermined upon arrival, lacking a scene-level oscillation or temptation to do otherwise that would generate active character pressure. Emotional states are articulated through metaphor ("feel his apology") rather than demonstrated through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio’s internal arc from lonely observer to willing participant is earned through specific memory (the mother's pot song) and active interrogation of the setting. The final choice to become a "knot-maker" represents a legible shift in stance with the felt cost of accepting burden over freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is a distinct, competent guide with a consistent worldview, though they function more as a lyrical catalyst than a character at risk. The lack of deep internal conflict or personal cost keeps the characterization from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist possesses a distinct, stylized voice that fits the fable-like tone, but they function more as a static sage than a complex character. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; their confidence is absolute from the start, which limits emotional depth and makes the "lesson" feel performative rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal hierarchy—valuing truth over comfort—is consistently dramatized in action. The final choice to refuse the diamond but keep the love note adds a layer of earned humanity, creating a closure that feels character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is distinct, but interiority relies on stylized abstraction rather than embodied emotion. The "sin" introduced as a primary motive is never unpacked or resolved, leaving the character's internal stakes incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is a lyrical vessel defined by a stated desire ("to become the translator") rather than a character tested by genuine internal conflict. He faces no contradictory impulses or external opposition; the widow and village facilitate his goal without resistance, making his choices feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    The antagonist's immediate conversion via the "sonic absolution" bypasses agency and reduces the psychological conflict to a binary switch. Marek’s "logically emotional" trait is stated in exposition ("graphed feelings against facts") rather than dramatized through a choice where logic and emotion genuinely collide.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is an archetypal "wise elder" whose internal state is summarized rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. While the voice is distinct, the character lacks a genuine test or blind spot; wisdom is possessed from the start rather than earned, resulting in a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—torn between the safety of algorithmic compliance and the burden of historical witness—is compelling and well-dramatized. The shift from a trembling hand to "fortified vulnerability" earns the defiance at the climax, grounding the supernatural realization in a distinct moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and the chaplain’s empathy is tangible, but the proprietor functions largely as a "mystical mentor" archetype dispensing aphorisms rather than a fully realized character. The dialogue feels staged ("I listen for lives") rather than natural, reducing the sense of genuine human interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilex is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation ("ring a bell") and consistent, whimsical interiority. However, the emotional climax ("tears on his gloves") feels slightly performed rather than earned by on-page struggle, as the character's irreverence distances the reader from genuine vulnerability until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist has a distinct professional identity and a clear internal conflict between policy and memory. The trait "brightly attentive" is stated directly as a label, though it functionally enables the investigation. While the internal motivation is strong, the emotional connection to the victim relies heavily on poetic assertion ("sensed absence turn solid") rather than dramatized interaction or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist displays strong agency, proposing a concrete solution and paying a personal cost (staying to keep watch). However, a consistency slip undermines the character's definition: they are introduced as a summoned outsider ("they had summoned") but later refer to "our town," confusing the established distance.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s journey from "euthanasia tourist" to "Doctor Last-Minute" is compelling and grounded in specific action. Internal conflict is resolved through a clear decision to delay the appointment. The score is held back from the highest bands by a tendency toward poetic analysis of emotion rather than raw embodiment; the narrator often diagnoses their own state ("grips reality loosely") rather than simply inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist functions as a static dispenser of wisdom rather than a character under pressure; his motivations are abstract self-mythology ("storms learned my name"). The interaction relies on archetypal roles (Sage and Seeker) rather than genuine human connection, and the traveler's immediate compliance with his advice robs the scene of necessary interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator and walker are distinct, competent figures filling ritual roles. While their dynamic is professional and respectful, interiority is somewhat limited to the immediate task, lacking deep internal contradiction or high personal stakes beyond job performance. The walker's fatigue and "honest" eyes add welcome texture, and the shared moment of widening the clearing suggests a relationship deepening, but they remain largely archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetype (the magical healer) than a fully realized character; the "tremble" attempts vulnerability but feels performative rather than a sign of genuine internal conflict. Motivation is purely functional and meets no meaningful resistance from the self or others.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scholar’s reticence is effectively dramatized through action (the index cards, the silent interplay with the room) rather than just description. The backstory of the "bruised permission" grounds his motivation well, though his internal state feels more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation—managing a future loss of memory—is distinct and drives the central ritual effectively. However, the internal state relies on summary ("precognitively forgetful") and filter verbs ("He wanted," "He thought") rather than dramatized, embodied struggle, keeping the character slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is competent and distinct, fitting the "sage" archetype well, but lacks internal conflict or vulnerability. The narrative validates their expertise without exposing a genuine flaw or risk of failure, resulting in a static "flat arc" where the character creates change but undergoes little themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrator functions as a flawless facilitator without internal conflict or personal stakes, resulting in perfect emotional calibration where no choice carries risk. The protagonist displays no contradictory impulses, serving only to execute the plot's requirements with "decisive" competence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s specific trait ("quietly deliberate") is actively deployed to solve the central puzzle, integrating character definition with plot mechanics. The motivation is abstract but sustained, and the intellectual cost of the "witness" contract provides sufficient agency and consequence to anchor the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's "forgiving skeptic" persona provides a distinct, consistent internal filter that colors every observation. Motivation is clear and ethical; the choice to "tell it plain" aligns perfectly with the bone-setter's trade of painful correction. Ari’s guilt is embodied in his physical posture, creating a strong psychosomatic link between character and action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is rooted clearly in the backstory of fire, but the present action lacks a sharp, dramatized decision; the process feels habitual rather than a response to immediate pressure. The emotional arc is stable rather than dynamic, resulting in a portrait of stasis rather than a character under current stress.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's specific identity as a "watchful dreamer" drives the scene's choreography, grounding the lyrical voice in active preparation. The "inventory" beat rather than a hug effectively establishes the distance and tension between the characters without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("conflicted novelist") rather than a specific individual. Interiority is abstract and metaphor-heavy ("breath itself were undecided") rather than embodied. While the internal struggle is stated ("resisting only habit"), the lack of on-page resistance or difficult choices makes the character feel more like a vessel for the theme than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on the "magical stranger" archetype with no internal conflict or flaws. Rowen functions as a plot device to deliver a remedy rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure; the narrator is a passive observer whose single moment of doubt resolves instantly without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist is a competent, distinct figure with clear agency and a specific skillset. The backstory of the sister provides a necessary emotional anchor, though the character relies more on procedural competence than on deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith is a consistent, competent focalizer whose worldview drives the narrative logic. The renunciation of the mentor's timer at the end provides a necessary tangible cost, grounding the philosophical closure in a character-specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and poignant, driving the accumulation of burdens. However, interiority is often filtered through such dense metaphorical abstraction ("pulse to north," "saltshaken hand") that embodied emotion feels distant, making the character feel more like a vessel for poetry than a person in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist is clearly drawn, and her choice not to sand the knot is a strong character beat. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic summaries ("working to harvest lessons from loss") rather than embodied feeling, which creates a barrier to deep empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich and consistent, effectively blending the "scavenger" persona with the emotional arc of regret. The motive to "negotiate with my own ghost" drives every action, and the shift from "hinges and promises" to "payment in verbs" marks a clear character progression. The "resolute" trait is well-dramatized through the difficult ascent and the refusal to flee the ghost's demands.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist is highly competent and wise but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; the trait "functionally creative" feels like a label rather than a source of difficult choices. The arc is smooth and inevitable, lacking a moment where the character's flaws or doubts create resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as an introverted scribe, but his internal journey relies heavily on abstract introspection ("shame a mask for tenderness") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The emotional resolution is triggered by a coincidental external event (the finch) rather than active agency, making the character feel somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is stated clearly ("to understand the architecture of lies"), but the protagonist faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. The "serene" stance removes potential friction (revenge vs. truth) before it can dramatize cost. The character feels more like a camera than an agent in a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is consistent but functions more as a vessel for the concept than a complex character with contradictory impulses. Self-definition relies on exposition ("I am a philosophical seed collector") rather than demonstrated struggle, and the lack of internal friction or meaningful cost caps the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s concept as a "clerk of explained absences" is compelling and professionally competent. However, the client’s dialogue voice ("latitude is crueler," "wrong weather") converges fully with the narrator’s high-lyric register, making them sound like the same entity rather than distinct individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions effectively as a fable archetype, and his transition from prince to caretaker is earned through labor. However, his interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic assertions (e.g., "heart a metronome of quaking reverie") rather than grounded psychological specificity or embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions more as a poetic vessel than a living character, with interiority summarized through metaphor ("unlearned his purpose") rather than dramatized struggle. The interaction with the boy lacks friction; he serves as a thematic prop who accepts her wisdom immediately, depriving the scene of genuine interpersonal dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.0)
    Ilias functions more as a thematic vessel than a fully realized character; his motivation is abstract and strictly adheres to the prompt's instructions without personal grounding. The conflict with the broker reveals no internal struggle, as the antagonist is defeated by a convenient vision rather than Ilias's wit or sacrifice. The repetition of his trait ("realistically imaginative") acts as a label rather than a demonstrated quality driving complex choices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and consistent, effectively embodying the "otherworldly sentimentalist" archetype. However, the secondary characters (captain, child) function as props for the moral rather than autonomous agents, yielding to the narrator's lesson with unearned speed that lowers the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrator relies on explicit self-labeling ("I am a thoughtful gravestone carver," "I am fiercely meditative") instead of dramatizing these traits through action or conflict. The absence of internal contradiction or distinct flaws creates an idealized protagonist who faces no genuine emotional risk or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's internal shift from rigid precision to empathetic listening is beautifully dramatized through the clockwork metaphor. The "grief as slop in the bearings" backstory provides grounded motivation for the previous rigidity, making the change felt and earned. The final interaction with the fisherman cements the character's growth with a concrete, vulnerable action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    The gardener is distinct and consistent, but his "blithe" persona feels like a protective coloration that is never truly challenged. He moves through the plot as a solver rather than a struggler; the emotional cost of the discovery is described ("soften into respect") rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal process is vivid and the professional voice is distinct. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat sterile; the "fear" of misuse is resolved too neatly by "modeling remedy" without a felt personal cost or deeper struggle. The character operates more as an archetype of an architect than a vulnerable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's specific skill set (orchestra copyist) nicely informs the narrative voice and the method of resolution ("copying the cadence"). However, the character functions more as a lyrical archetype than a flesh-and-blood survivor; the "story famine" is stated as context but the visceral hunger or cost of that deprivation is aestheticized rather than embodied in difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator’s internal landscape is vivid, and the mother’s reluctance is palpable, but the characters function primarily as poetic vessels for the theme. The mother’s shift from guarding the box to granting permission ("Take what you need") happens too smoothly, lacking the friction or oscillation expected of such a deep-seated trauma response. Dialogue often mirrors the narration’s elevated register, causing voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist is sharply drawn with a distinct, "abrasively calm" voice that perfectly matches the "wannabe philosopher" archetype. Internal conflict (the urge to lie vs. the discipline of the chronometer) drives the external choice naturally, and the worldview is dramatized through action rather than just exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and the internal voice is consistent, but the central conflict between the students resolves too easily through a symbolic gesture with the rosette. The emotional shift relies on metaphorical summary ("something unclenched") rather than a dramatized interpersonal struggle or distinct dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions as a competent, idealized archetype rather than a complex individual under pressure. While the voice is consistent, the "informally wise" trait is delivered through exposition and successful action rather than difficult choices or internal contradiction. The emotional arc is smooth and lacks the grit of genuine struggle; the chef suffers no failures or doubts during the process.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, and the motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives the scene. However, the "involuntarily truthful" trait functions more as a convenient plot lever to force the reveal than a source of deep internal conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "normality noticer" is a distinct, specialized observer, and the motivation is clear and consistent. However, the character functions primarily as a sensory instrument; they lack a deep internal crucible or high-stakes trade-off, which limits emotional complexity despite the strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Oris is a distinct, consistent voice, but functions more as a didactic guide than a protagonist under pressure; the Scholar’s internal state is accessed too conveniently via "telepathy," reducing her to a strawman who yields instantly to the lesson. The lack of genuine internal conflict or risk for Oris limits emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is sharply defined not just by the label "grim optimist," but by the specific, embodied choice to reject the rupture to preserve the "texture" of memory. The internal conflict between the desire for the past and the commitment to the "proof" is dramatized with rigorous consistency. The final stance—continuing the climb to honor the form—is a profound moment of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lina is a clearly defined focalizer with a consistent worldview, but she lacks internal contradiction or struggle. Her "doubting heart" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; she moves through the story with serene competence. The interaction with the neighbor is gentle and validating, missing the friction or "crucible" dynamics that reveal deeper character layers.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator is distinct, with a voice that blends professional detachment ("cataloging") with deep empathy. The internal conflict between being an "embalmer" versus a "nurse" drives the central innovation (the bread), and the acceptance of the "nectar armor" represents a clear, earned shift in identity. The character feels lived-in and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary; the "counter clockwise" trait is not merely a label but drives the unique methodology (reverse-engineering) and worldview ("against the grain of consolation"). The internal conflict between the desire to escape fate and the acceptance of human connection leads to a sharply earned renunciation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.4)
    Character motivation is sharply defined by the "photographic curse" and the desperate bargain for existence. The narrator's internal contradiction—fearing invisibility while being "edited" by observation—drives the climax and justifies the "unbosoming" tactic with specific emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's professional competence drives the narrative effectively, transforming fear into technical action. Motivation is clear and constant, though the lack of internal conflict or doubt limits the emotional stakes; Zaya functions more as a tool than a character, which fits the tight scope but restricts relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("questions rot if kept") drives a pivotal micro-choice to ignore the warning tag, escalating the risk naturally. The internal conflict between safety and the need for answers is dramatized through action, culminating in a closure choice that accepts "measurement" over mercy with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's specific temperament drives the resolution, particularly the choice to amend rather than destroy the ledger. However, the "emotionally rational" trait relies heavily on self-diagnosis ("I answer myself... the only way an emotionally rational mind can") rather than purely dramatized friction, bordering on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") and the "Stoically sensitive" trait is inserted as a backstory nickname rather than dramatized through pressure. Motivation is stated explicitly ("I did not come merely to measure") rather than revealed through friction or high-stakes choices. The character feels like a vessel for the prose’s themes rather than a person with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ossa is a compelling, highly specific focalizer whose "tranquilly perceptive" nature perfectly aligns with the narrative's demands. Her internal motivation—to trace origins rather than ownership—drives every beat, and the final choice to hide the stamp rather than expose it immediately reveals a disciplined, earned restraint fitting her character. The voice is consistent, merging professional detachment with deep melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation ("luminous torment") is vividly embodied in his craft, grounding the magical premise in tangible labor. His internal state drives the ritual, and the final shift—from obsession to a "loosening" of the ache—feels earned by the process on the page. The moment of bowing "without expectation" marks a strong, character-defining choice that solidifies his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's trauma and expertise blend into a compelling, specific voice that drives the piece. The choice to send the coordinates as a "dare" effectively dramatizes the survivor's defiance and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist and pilgrim function more as lyrical archetypes than grounded individuals, serving the metaphorical premise rather than driving it with distinct internal friction. The "perpetually surprised" trait is told and then resolved schematically, feeling like an assigned label rather than an organic behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape of guilt and forgery is compelling, creating a strong lens for the narrative. The reveal that he was the boy who saved her father adds a melodramatic coincidence that slightly undercuts the autonomy of the present-moment dynamic, but his choice to confess restores agency. The shift from deceiver to collaborator is earned through the shared activity of the archive search.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, but the attribute "uncommonly thoughtful" is delivered via diagnostic self-assessment rather than purely through action. The secondary characters react with convenient, textbook appropriateness to the narrator's thematic speech, resolving deep vendettas too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to "align heart and action" drives the plot, but the "merrily" aspect of the assigned trait exists only as an adverbial label, not in behavior. The emotional arc feels slightly constructed, with the interaction with the boy serving as a functional prop for healing rather than a complex relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is sharply drawn, pivoting from a desire for oblivion to a confrontation with specific, high-stakes guilt ("weaponized fatigue"). The confession sequence grounds the character's past in a tangible professional sin rather than generic crime, making the final choice to "ferry the reluctant" a deeply earned transformation of their initial motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator's motivation to reforge the bond is palpable and drives the ritualistic plot. The internal conflict ("reluctant as dawn") transitions into a decisive surrender of selfhood ("I do not become a bird... but a passage") with a specifically articulated cost (losing the "plain speech" and "map of my mother").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal arc—from a desperate desire to control time to a humble acceptance of atonement—is deeply felt and dramatized through the ritual. The specific "cartomancer" identity is not merely a label but actively shapes her perception of the saucer crack as a "prophecy" and directs her tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich with metaphor ("wolves," "knives") but lacks specific, grounded psychology; the "pacifism" and emotional regulation feel more like functional plot mechanisms than lived traits. The struggle is summarized through poetic abstraction ("naming the angers") rather than dramatized through resistance or failure, making the character feel somewhat idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s internal conflict between the utility of prophecy and her fear of vanity provides strong psychological grounding. The concept of a "destitute philanthropist" who spends "coincidence" is a compelling, specific trait that drives her unique method of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.3)
    The characters function as poetic vessels rather than people with grounded motivations; Rhun’s instant, frictionless conversion at the climax lacks psychological credibility. The narrator’s stated competence ("calmly inventive") is asserted rather than dramatized through struggle, and the lack of internal conflict makes the "revolution" feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Eel Herder is vividly characterized with a tragic, precognitive burden that motivates her sacrifice effectively. The narrator’s motivation is clear, but their acceptance of the life-altering condition ("agreed to more than rescue") feels emotionally rapid; the internal conflict resolves with minimal on-page struggle given the magnitude of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's interiority relies on abstract metaphor ("thinning fear into a clarity") rather than embodied emotion or distinct psychology. Voice convergence is significant; the caretaker and the poet speak in the same elevated, poetic register, making them sound like functions of the prose rather than distinct individuals. The motivation is stated explicitly ("to understand the cartography of scars") but lacks a dramatized cost or struggle to earn the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's worldview is tightly integrated with action, creating a distinct, if cerebral, internal life that fits the fable-like tone. While the "dueling philosopher" archetype is vivid, emotional reactions are often sublimated into intellect, slightly distancing the reader from the visceral cost of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, and the "penny poet" persona is vivid. However, the "molting" attribute acts more as a framing device than a constraint that complicates the scene's immediate choices. Lio functions as a seamless extension of the narrator's will; they lack the interpersonal friction or distinct agenda needed to generate secondary pressure, resulting in a somewhat static dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is a coherent archetypal figure whose melancholy fits the fable-like tone perfectly. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("steely longing"), and the lack of contradictory internal impulses or specific human grit limits emotional depth beyond the allegorical role.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist is a compelling archetype with a distinct worldview ("empirically whimsical"), fitting the fable-like mode. However, interiority leans heavily on philosophical abstraction ("doubt is luminous") rather than embodied emotion or deep internal conflict. The character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a vulnerable individual making high-cost choices.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between strict control ("pruning storms") and acceptance is vividly dramatized through the bonsai metaphor. The final decision to change teaching philosophy serves as a potent, earned Resonant Reconfiguration of the character's worldview.

    Robot's interiority is concrete and particular, with hesitation resolved into earned composure via looped micro-choices like playing the violin; contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity) act simultaneously in scene.

    The narrator’s interiority is textured and consistent—light hoarder, breath-tender, mirror-maker who buried love in shelves of unspent hours. Embodied contradiction is dramatized when the camera’s inhale/exhale literally remodels the bridge, forcing an on-page micro-choice that externalizes the internal stalemate. Cost is felt when the glass room becomes a door and the rib-cage pantry unlatches; renunciation of hoarding is earned. Minor: the stranger beats only a faint echo of his own ache; relationship crucible therefore thin, but single-POV default met.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and continuously embodied (“ink sweating like dew,” “breathing their damp astonishment”). Contradictory impulses—desire to master time vs. surrender to its dissolve—coexist in scene, not summary. The final acceptance of continual fading is earned through successive sensual encounters with the halo, the pavilion, the submerged vault; the cost is visible in the swallowed ring and the lungs holding “the pale roar.” Micro-choices (pressing shard, stepping onto light-path) tighten the stance; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“staggering grace of someone who has practiced falling and rising”—and every micro-choice (sorting keys by rust-tones, knotting her chain as seed-sling) grows from her liberator/chained contradiction. The final endurance image—palms lined with seed dust—pays the cost of her vow without epiphany overload. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount clarity is clean. One hairline slip: “patient strategy moving like weather” drifts toward abstraction, but the metaphor is brief and anchored in her weather-beaten body.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrator’s synesthetic ear-for-color and grief over the stolen patents give a sharp, embodied interiority; each micro-choice (tuning coils, forging bowls, testing the diver) flows from the same wound. The final renunciation—sealing the pattern of pre-betrayal rather than chasing revenge—pays the cost of forgiving what can’t be undone. Flaw: the diver appears only once and vanishes, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is missing. Still, the solo arc earns its quiet stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thief's quietly savvy trait and interior contradiction ("late but exactly on time") energize early beats; his micro-choice to crack the jar open anchors causality. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts next moves. Mentor’s re-entrance is thin—no bodily change or status shift—so relationship crucible only half-fires. Closure cost (mentor returned to body, thief accepts stewardship) is legible but not foreshadowed by prior flaw or debt, so renunciation feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Arlen’s calm, ceremonial interiority is consistent and embodied; his micro-choices (narrating each latch, pressing the bookmark into warming glass) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—abandoning fear that science and tenderness cannot coexist—pays off earlier setup and carries felt cost as he sets the bookmark in a chapter he has literally written in glass. The lone flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-narration (“safeness is not a wall”) that momentarily abstracts state into label.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“falling for others, never for myself”—and the final rooftop renunciation carries embodied cost. Micro-choices (breath-count steadied hands, reciting bone dates) tie fear to action. Relationship shift with brother lands, but child’s agency is asserted rather than dramatized, muting crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oracle’s interiority is lyrically particular—her knuckles stung by salt, her need to “retell the world without the world’s noise”—yet her decisive choice to stay and carve the map into stone carries visible cost (bleeding fingers). Courier’s arc from arsonist to carrier is cleanly traced through micro-choices (tearing sleeve, bow). Relationship under pressure alters both stances; no contradictory impulses shown in-scene, but renunciation is earned. Voice stays distinct, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The janitor’s quiet, recursive desire to “find where thoughts come from” is embodied in every sweep and bow-stroke; the loops let contradictory impulses—obedience vs. curiosity—play out simultaneously. The final stance—practice as place, endurance as faith—earns its cost by foreclosing any exit from the courtyard. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Registrar’s interior contradiction—covet the lens / fear silence—drives every beat; cowardice→public confession arcs credibly. Embodied tremble in “heartbeat is a drum in my wrists” shows pressure without label-speak. Micro-choice to mount bandstand, not hide, forecloses retreat with visible social risk. Cost scales to length: one night, one reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gardener’s motive—proving the garden remembers—drives every micro-choice; the mended-deception confession is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“palm of soil,” “constellations of stubborn care”) and avoids label-speak. The final stance—leaving the gate unlatched—earns its quiet trust because the maze has already tested him. One hairline slip: the line “fortune is a mirror, and gardeners are light” drifts toward aphorism, slightly blunting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jae’s obliging mechanic trait is shown through tangible micro-choices (tuning gantries, pulling the surge lever, planting beacons), each carrying frost-bitten cost; the sideways-time obsession drives every beat and is paid for in bodily risk and solitude. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic speak. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; single-POV interior contradiction (trust in his own voice vs fear of temporal loss) is dramatized in scene. Closure is earned: his laugh is small, affectionate, and quietly accepts the self-division that let the mantas—and proof—return. Missing higher band only because the emotional plateau after rescue is slightly under-cooked; cost is felt but not sharpened to a sting.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and consistent with musician POV—“shivering beside a cracked viola case,” “cold nibbling my shins.” Micro-choices (turning pages like pond lilies, stepping on glints) align with stakes. Flaw: no visible cost after taking baton—water lifts instantly, portrait heals, musician exits unchanged; renunciation is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Protagonist’s interior monologue is concrete (“small stone star” rattling each step), but the single on-page relationship (oracle-visitor) stays largely didactic; no status shift shown. Motive to “unwrite” the lie through bodily balance is tracked, but the final release feels off-loaded to oracle guidance rather than earned micro-choice; renunciation cost is visible yet not fully interiorized.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lone protagonist’s interior contradiction—skeptical of belief yet clinging to relics—drives every micro-choice; the wheel-turning beat embodies embodied cost as palms sting with cold iron. Motivation stays legible and intensifies: the need to weigh a “swallowed truth” escalates from mapping radio panic to literal valve torque. The father’s death is not summarized but re-experienced through the pipe’s sigh, so the renunciation—leaving the wheel open—carries inherited weight. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; thought stays welded to sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays largely static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the final “I witness” is a restatement, not a costly renunciation. Micro-choices (folding the swan, pressing the wall) serve navigation, not moral pressure, so agency feels ornamental. The oath is declared repeatedly yet never tested by a moment that would force its violation or costly reaffirmance. Result: credible atmosphere, but no visible hierarchy of values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist’s softly-adaptive music therapy stance is embodied in every micro-choice (kalimba pulse matched to Ada’s locket tick); interiority stays concrete, conflict is grief vs. willingness to let sound in, and the final low-key lullaby request is credible renunciation of despair. Only nit: “wondering is a form of love” drifts toward therapist aphorism; still, Ada’s tracing the question-mark curl supplies visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s porous, listening nature is vividly embodied—he strokes walls, whispers to axes, lets tapestry dust bite his palm. Internal contradiction is present yet soft: he both craves witness and surrenders to endless influx, but this tension is stated more than dramatised. His rearranging of shelves along the new ‘pull’ is the single micro-choice that visibly costs him balance and time, forging the needed causal link to closure. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are rightfully N/A; the arc is renunciation/acceptance, fitting Track A scope.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“I move people like water”—but the prophetic knack is asserted, not embodied in a moment of failure or cost. The narrator’s choice to scatter the specs through light is active, yet the emotional contradiction inside that decision remains off-stage. We learn traits, but the stakes never test them under pressure; the only risk is the agent’s blank report, which the narrator never learns. Relationships (keeper) are atmospheric rather than crucible; no status shift hinges on her.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s shift from passive vessel to active chooser is rendered through micro-gesture (lips move, exhales) and the husband’s trembling hand—embodied, not labeled. Father Ilario’s contradictory gentleness and theatrical authority feel rooted in one coherent vocation; the loop-pedal ritual externalizes his interior logic without explanatory fluff. The final laugh—dry, unforgiving—crystallizes a cost that nobody hugs away. Only the husband remains slightly generic, a soft cap.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is lush, consistent, and character-specific; contradictions arrive in concrete sensory beats (“I taste one and it is salt and paper and violin steam”). The arc of renunciation—accepting that listening is louder than commanding—earns its cost through the mapped memories and the final surrender of the shell, a visible forfeiture that forecloses ego-driven noise.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is lush, embodied, and idiosyncratic (“learn its edges like a blind cartographer”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in distinct beats; the renunciation lands with poetic cost yet feels slightly abstract because the only concrete choice is the final toe-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—fear of her own growing numbness versus her vocation of teaching feeling—drives every action; her embodied micro-choice to thread the filament through the needle crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Oko’s wrist-listening and shell-grin supply distinct secondary pressure that alters her stance. No stock phrasing; even “frost beneath the ribs” is earned via prior winter imagery. Final bow—cavern “bows back with a breath she felt”—seals earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-recorder persona is convincingly etched through perceptual filters and tool-use, but the interior contradiction promised in the “refuse poor maps” motive never visibly collides with an on-page fear or flaw; the final stance is credible yet costs are only atmospheric, not personal. The micro-choice to plant decoy charts while dispatching the true data is sharp, but the beat is solitary—no status crucible or relational shift tests resolve. Still, the voice’s meteorological conscience feels lived-in and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amberhorn revelation turns passive grief into an active, costly choice to return; the vial’s shift from trap to compass externalizes the change. Interiority stays sensorily anchored (“rain returning to a river that had been walking empty”). One micro-choice—offering the lentern—shows value hierarchy with visible cost. Flaw: “diagnostic” tinge in “I understand the impact of memories” line could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The poet’s motive—to “discover the texture of time” while remaining ethically playful—remains concrete and continually shapes micro-choices (looping the rope, tasting memory-silt, the vow). Interiority is embodied rather than abstract (“rope smelled of rust and rain, braided the night”), and the final stance (forgive the self that ran first) is earned through the vision-knot sequence. Minor over-labeling (“ethically playful in every choice”) slightly abstracts motive; still, flaws are dramatized, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The violinist’s motive—”to unbind the silence” and “find beauty in the unfinished”—is concrete, embodied, and drives every micro-choice from lantern placement to the final gift of the shell. Interiority stays sensory (“barnacles hold their breath”) rather than diagnostic, and the renunciation of finished songs carries visible cost as the bow nods “like a patient bird.” Relationships (Lark, elders) function as crucible: the marble/shell swap alters their mutual state. Only the mother-map backstory is briefly summarized; it still tilts the present choice, so the slight tell is forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is razor-sharp and embodied: “resin breath raised stray hairs,” “sleeves crackled” under client static. Contradictory impulses—commerce vs. caretaking—coexist in every beat; the choice to let Rhea keep the petal is earned by the prior ethic of “shared trade.” Micro-choices (charging little, writing nothing) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The characterization never flattens into label-speak; even the final confession of wanting to “witness a client subsume the product” is a lived, paid-for desire.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s cautious-exuberant broker verging on civic penance is vivid; her ledger initiative and fee-forgiveness for the choir show micro-choices under pressure. Jun’s “whimsically attentive” librarian is sketched mostly through job detail (bookmarking winds, aligning maps to creaking mast) rather than contradiction under stress; he remains an accessory to Mara’s arc. Interiority stays concrete in Mara; Jun’s lens is surface-level so the relationship crucible never tests or changes him. The ending distributes custodianship but the cost of “sharing the weight” is asserted, not dramatized, muting the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sculptor’s interiority is vivid—"tenderized by strangers" is a perfect, embodied contradiction—and every micro-choice (answering with a reed ear, sliding obsidian shards like teeth) is character-particular. Status dynamics with Farrin and the townsfolk are legible and shift as the ring of bodies forms. The final renunciation—"not a statue, but my practice"—is earned and forecloses the easier path of solitary art. Only the "boldly sympathetic" label is asserted once without visible cost on the page, a hairline slip that keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The illustrator’s patience-as-currency trait is lived in every beat—sketching while balanced on tilting roofs, trading borrowed seconds for observation. The internal contradiction between scientific detachment and the irresistible urge to “uncage” the larval echo is dramatized in the moment he lets the infinity loop narrow, forfeiting control. Micro-choices (crouch, ink, seal) all flow from the same motive cluster and exact a visible cost: time-debt bells ring and the canal reclaims its cadence. The only bar to 9.0 is the slight off-page feel of the giant’s physiology—illustrator’s body under stress could be even more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for coherence yet renouncing reunion—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (threading moon-light rope through glass eyes, pocketing the knotted end). Each beat reweights his relation to absence, culminating in an earned stasis where the cost is the very theorem he must keep carrying. Interiority stays concrete (“laugh survives without the body, like a theorem whose proof is lost”), never lapsing into diagnostic speak. The refusal to stage a spectacle is a credible, character-specific flaw that forecloses the easier path of public resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dweller’s gentle, map-making compulsion is vivid and embodied; every kneepad-shuffle and cedar breath makes his “kindly methodical” nature a lived force rather than a label. His contradictory wish—to stay hidden yet be needed—drives every micro-choice and culminates in the silent, costly renunciation of the grate-arrow. The girl is sketched only as a silhouette of need, but that is sufficient for the story’s narrow lens; the emotional transaction still lands. Interiority stays concrete, free of therapy-speak, and the final cache-ledger feels earned because earlier chalk-marks foretold it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—command reflex vs. listening surrender—runs through every beat and is paid for in the final renunciation. Embodied emotion is precise: “the linden leaf crisped to a memory of wind.” Micro-choices (knotting vines, stepping aside) externalize the arc with visible cost. No therapy-speak; flaws persist and bless the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is painterly, specific, and contradictory—“paint became the only clean water I trusted” couples survival urge with aesthetic compulsion. Micro-choices (pocketing brooch, prying gnat free) are embodied and costly. The keeper’s grief and wry apology to barnacles individualize him; relational crucible forces the pact. Flaw: we are told “wryly earnest” twice but never shown it colliding with a costly mistake; the trait is asserted, not tripped.</question>
    <question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each rain trail, seam, and canvas layer thickens meaning until the final reconfiguration. Closure is Earned Stasis—releasing the gnat crystallizes their pact and the island’s returned silence; cost is legible in the keeper’s mute weep and the painter’s paint-stained steadiness. One soft causality bump: the mother’s kelp-draped apparition is coincidence that complicates, not resolves, so allowed under Situational/Accumulative hybrid.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal island is no postcard: retreating flats slicked with rust-scum, foxfire-licked peat seam, and puddles filming sky into mirrors directly shape where they kneel and what they surrender. The amber brooch operates as micro-setting—its oval trap and black comma decide the exact gesture of release. Weather and moonlight are not backdrop but timers that cue the apparition. Environment charges the final image; without that seam of ribbed amber the pact has no altar.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from experience”—is signaled early and tightens when the island demands an exchange they can bear. Agency: painter risks the brooch’s warmth to keep memory; keeper risks reopening grief; both foreclose simpler profit from collectors. Cost is visible: the gnat’s release and the keeper’s silent tears. One escalation beat suffices for accumulative design; pressure rises through density of rain trails, foxfire, and returned names rather than causal reversals.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from iterative exchanges: heirlooms for passage, brooch for warmth, gnat for freedom, paintings for witness—no maxim stated. Subtext lives in gesture: hand over hand on peat seam replaces prayer. Final image of rain trails “bright as breath” reweights prior suffering without moral. Only minus: “color is a kind of treaty” flirts with overt thesis, but wave’s refusal to answer rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The clairvoyant’s interiority is vivid—“I did not see it coming” is a lived contradiction—but her final hand-stray is more image than crucible; no clear hierarchy of values is forced to a cost on the page. The pilgrim’s shift from baker to bearer is embodied through scent and laughter, yet his kneeling choice is not tested by a forfeiture we feel. The relationship alters, but the guide’s stake is told more than enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archivist’s interior contradiction—compiling absences while resisting the urge to impose meaning—remains embodied in small tactile acts (turning the valve, noting “tone: none”). His reactive-visionary trait constrains him to wait for the world, so every micro-choice is a visible cost: he must borrow the woman’s lived rhythm to “hearten” the harbor. No stock epiphanies; the final renunciation of the trumpet valve to her hands is an earned stasis that forecloses ownership of the return. The single flaw is the woman’s summary backstory of exile, which briefly flattens her to a cautionary tale rather than a co-agent.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—cartographic precision versus surrender to pattern—are dramatized in every beat: folding maps until they “lost borders,” pressing the punch through air itself. Interiority stays concrete (“dots appeared on my skinscape”) and degrades under pressure (“trembling certainty”). The final renunciation—stepping through a mouth that demands un-buttoning maps—pays off the earlier flaw (measuring too much) with visible cost: the maps are gone, the train leaves without him. Voice remains singular, never diagnostic; even “analytically artistic” is redefined by action, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single, consistent first-person voice carries contradictory skepticism and protective warmth; every micro-choice—offering tea, aligning the tile, surrendering the shell—springs from the declared motive. Interiority stays embodied (“ink looked like her ship’s wake”) rather than diagnostic. The moment of endurance/renunciation is the quiet choice to keep the tower door open: the cost is lifelong custodianship of others’ grief with no promise of belief—earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Immortal’s voice is electric—angles whisper, boredom “has edges now”—but Lio’s interiority is second-hand; his refusal to forgive is told, never embodied. Micro-choice under pressure is thin: the narrator bargains with prisms in summary, not scene, and Lio’s single nod is the only visible trade-off. The cost is abstract (“memories of nights when centuries stuck like frost”)—vivid, yet never forced into a physical beat that locks the change. Still, the voice is so singular that the character lingers as myth rather than cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory desire to “cancel debts cleanly” while abetting fraud is dramatized in every tactile choice; the tremor in Arman’s fingers against the gel-cold wrist embodies the cost. Micro-choices—draining the sink to mask cart scrape, singing under CCTV—reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The final image of the ink pot as “a little moon with tides that answer to hands” crystallizes the inherited moral calculus and forecloses the father’s path. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even the metaphor of “fairness is a curve” is earned through prior sensory stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stationer’s quiet compulsion to “give the town a workable grammar for waiting” is embodied in every micro-choice—measuring lamp hum, gilding ice—so the renunciation of factual record for invented solace carries felt cost. Interior contradiction is palpable: scholarly precision bent toward benevolent fabrication. The final touch of addresses muttered like beads crystallizes a lifetime of habit become ritual. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; solo arc suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic—“my fingertips taste bitter, the way lies do”—and the proneness to roam the port eavesdropping for story shards gives him a lived, embodied motive. The final micro-choice—laying the poison label on the crate and walking away—crystallizes his hierarchy of values (truth as texture, not revenge) with visible cost: the widow alone must now balance her ledger. No internal contradiction is dramatized in-scene, and the near-total absence of on-page relationship pressure (only a silent stare with the mechanic) keeps the crucible aspect thin; hence capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    The myth-buster’s contradictory drives—comic defiance and elegiac duty—co-exist in every micro-choice (tuning peg, shell pivot, crooked bow). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “the string tasted the wind” shows desire, not explains it. Final endurance—packing the bandaged cello while the dome keeps humming—pays the cost of his vocation without sermon. Voice remains singular, textured, and irreproducible.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Nessa’s interiority—"I think in loops and ledgers"—is dramatized through page-level micro-choices (painting the chip into wet paint, realigning rafts) that visibly cost her fraternal bond and political innocence. The contradictory pull between guild loyalty and consortium pay-cheque is kept alive in-scene, not summarised, culminating in the handshake chip moment that forecloses pure partisanship. Brother’s presence supplies status tension, but his interior is ventriloquised rather than inhabited, and the liaison’s poet-planner turn feels expedient rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The solitary narrator’s curiosity, hunger to “prove it had ever been here,” and inherited Nightwatch duty fuse into a credible, embodied motive. Micro-choices—flicking the ampoule, slowing breath, pressing the shutter—track an internal hierarchy of values (memory vs. agency mandate) under rising pressure. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial; no diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—recording instead of rescuing—pays the cost of maternal legacy and is earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artisan’s blindness is not a label; it drives every micro-choice (threading braid by touch, reading ripples). Her “magnetic calm” under threat feels earned because earlier beats show her substituting fingertip vibration for sight. The apprentice is secondary but supplies live status pressure: when Mirel’s mirror slips, the artisan’s inhale reveals cost. No interior contradiction is dramatized—she never doubts her method—so the arc is competence porn rather than wrenching change, capping her below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured—editor’s need to “find where the rivers begin” collides with fear of taming the wild, embodied in chalk-and-glass cartography. Micro-choice turning wheel while falcon watches shows hierarchy: map over safety. Flaw (subtle hubris) pushes act; cost (must chase next departure) lands cleanly. No secondary character on page; relationship lens not needed.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tuner’s quiet, embodied patience and the mother’s wary-to-willing shift are cleanly dramatized through gait and breath; the children laugh on cue yet feel real. Interior contradiction is light—he never doubts—so the arc is collective, not personal, but motives stay legible and the final “practice” choice costs everyone tomorrow’s time.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Contradictory impulses—crushing panic vs. deliberate stillness—are enacted in the corridor scrape and transmitter placement; flimsy transmitter line and vial tied to chest literalize cost. Interiority stays concrete, tethered to tool and depth rather than abstract fear. The final swim carries earned pride/terror without tidy moral calibration. Only limit: we never learn why this “sender” alone can improvise signal-perfume fusion—competence edges toward convenient expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s contradictory need for both silence and confession is embodied in every beat; the lattice object externalizes the split. Interiority stays concrete—“wolves into every shadow,” “brine of a promise kept”—never drifting into label-speak. Micro-choices (climbing, placing the lattice over the drain) crystallize values under pressure. Cost is felt: the inherited lie is loosened but not erased, and the open door implies future peril.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The keeper’s interior contradiction—devotion to the trees versus erasure of self—drives every micro-choice. The ghost bride’s pressure forces him to confront the cost of his farmer-heart neglect, culminating in the earned stasis of hanging the bead. Emotions live in body: graft scars “quiver like a closed eye learning light.” Voice remains singular, lyrical, and grounded; no stock phrasing intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sera’s interior contradiction—optimism as stubbornness—drives every beat; the tether-sewing micro-choice literalizes her refusal to surrender and forecloses retreat. Embodied emotion (“I cannot breathe their absence without doing”) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The final renunciation—leaving the plate—costs her the talisman and earns the town’s new steadiness. Only the elders’ off-stage “say” keeps her from full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s contradictory pull between documentary detachment and visceral re-rooting is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing stele routes with a thumb, scavenging pomegranate wood for the gnomon—so the renunciation of departure earns its hinge-moment cost. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak; “the orchard had always been a mouth” is perceived, not preached. Sami functions less as secondary crucible than chorus, yet the single-POV default is met; status dynamics are thin but not required. Earned stasis lands when the narrator accepts orbit instead of exit, foreclosing the diaspora loop with visible nightly ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Auricle/namer’s interiority is vivid—‘I test names the way dentists test nerves’—and the final refusal to drop the letter is an Earned Stasis that costs him the clean getaway he once sought; the only flaw is a touch of self-diagnosis in the chalk epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    The "fool" persona is lived-in: every metaphor the narrator stitches is a micro-choice that costs blood and privacy. Interiority stays needle-sharp—"I recognized my own mask in theirs"—and the renunciation of safety at the end is earned by the whole accretive pattern. No stock phrases; even the bodily prick is a specific, character-bound ritual. The single flaw: the keeper’s interiority is only glimpsed through wrist quivers, so the relationship crucible is slightly under-braided.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cryptic-medium persona is vivid and embodied; every beat is filtered through “answers arrive sideways and hum.” Internal contradiction pulses in the simultaneous need to stay (stillness practice on blackwater) and the inherited reflex to bolt. Micro-choices—tying the shard pendant, letting the shard’s edge lie quiet—chart a legible shift from flight to open-wound witness. The arc ends in Earned Stasis: the wound becomes “a small white door learning how to stay open,” a renunciation whose cost is the forever-bleeding palm that keeps lunar time.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The translator’s interiority is specific and embodied—“we unknot weather in other people’s chests”—and his micro-choice to decrypt the cast turns the coral from relic to key, charging the closure. His contradictory motives—grief-archive versus peace-broker—co-exist in scene, never summarized. The moment he trades a Reka word for an Atapo one shows status dynamics and value hierarchy under pressure, foreclosing old silence with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    The mural artist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—light as “fruit baskets,” fresco shard as mentor—but the “rediscover lost joy” motive stays static; no internal contradiction surfaces under pressure. Micro-choices (threading film, holding shard to fog) show values, yet the final stance is only affirmation, not renunciation or fresh risk, so cost feels light. Enough for solid characterization, short of the earned stasis that would lift higher.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The restorer’s curiosity-driven, methodically playful stance is consistently embodied through micro-choices (tap-counting, solvent timing, coin-rolling). Internal contradiction—fear of erasure versus hunger for discovery—surfaces in the hairline-crack admission and earns the final lighter burden. Grandfather’s voice threads backstory into present action without unearned epiphany. The closure renunciation (leaving the nickel, accepting porous certainty) is causally seeded and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s “candidly cryptic” voice is vivid and consistent; the gourd seed and greenhouse work as embodied memory and tool. Interiority is specific—“truth looks better in chitin and pollen”—and choices (mapping gardens, releasing lacewings) align with motive. The final laugh-over-beans moment shows earned micro-choice that cancels the levy, paying visible social cost. Minor drift: “charming rogue scholar” is asserted more than demonstrated in action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    The insomniac-poet identity is vivid via curating darkness “like a library,” embodied insomnia, and salt-to-sugar motive. Interior contradiction—vigilance vs. devotion—drives micro-choices (pressing sea-blooms, breathing onto postcard). The final renunciation (learning to nap between heartbeats) pays the cost of abandoning vigilance, earned by prior causal beats. Voice occasionally abstracts into lyric shorthand (“reef-shadow joy”) that blurs embodied specificity, preventing 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is richly embodied—"my hands carry the polish of years spent listening"—and every micro-choice (breathing with the crack, sewing without silencing) flows from the caretaker’s vocation. The only reason this isn’t 9.5 is that the personal flaw/peril never sharpens into a contradictory impulse that could fail; the success feels pre-destined by craft rather than wrested from risk.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “carefully reckless” contradiction is embodied in the salt-ravine flashback and the present gamble of composing the suite; interiority stays specific to a linguist’s metaphors (“dust motes as footnotes”). Micro-choices—dipping the quill, singing the headings—reveal hierarchy of values. The final shared revision shows earned change: trust re-configured through joint authorship. Missing 9.0 because Lio’s return feels slightly convenient; his interior shift is implied rather than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The machinist’s interior contradiction—trader-aligned skill vs ash-keeper loyalty—stays alive in every micro-choice (chain pacing, burner scraping, vow of song-logging). Emotions are embodied (trembling fingers, sugar-bitter taste) rather than labeled. The final stance—public silence, private song—earns its cost: lifelong vigilance accepted on-page. Only a sliver off because the broker/lover backstory is inferred, not dramatized, softening the highest-stakes motive.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—needing to trust again yet fearing theft of their music—powers every micro-choice from parcel-cutting to ladder-climbing; embodied tension in “the attic smells of glue and cedar, and the pigeons preen like small hearths” grounds the arc. Renunciation of suspicion lands with felt cost when the Mars chip is sewn to Lark, literalizing the gamble. The violinist remains off-page, so relationship crucible is moot; headcount stays legible. Flaw complicity is present but slightly underplayed—no catastrophic mistake is shown, only the memory of one—so the change feels more lyrical than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lost-child motivation is palpable in every image; the refusal to descend keeps the distance rule alive and charges the final image with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only weather-code and grain reading as thinking. The only drag: “featherly determined” repeats without new contradiction after the opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s desire “to learn the rhythm of belonging” is dramatized through the synchronized-breathing ritual and the final image of maps that “breathe with me,” showing embodied change. Interiority stays concrete—reading drowned avenues as constellations, feeling tide clocks in the ribs—avoiding label-speak. The burnt-feather micro-choices (handing, setting down) externalize values under pressure. Cost is present but muted: the city “felt almost native,” a hair short of visible forfeiture, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s occupation (“sea-foam recollectionist”) supplies a quirky lens rather than a contradiction to act upon; interiority is lyrical but generic (“my favorite neighborhood”) and no micro-choice visibly risks or costs anything. The final “bow” and seed-scattering are gentle, not staked against a live loss, so the change feels ornamental, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The street-performer’s calm, chess-guided “ordering of randomness” is lived in every micro-choice; the janitor’s grief and the girl’s wonder are likewise revealed through tactile gesture rather than label. Interiority stays concrete (“I speak in counts, but my counts dress like chance”). The final renunciation—letting the moment happen, not forcing applause—earns its hush because every prior beat has shown him pay with patience and risk. Only the faintest reserve keeps this from 9+: we never feel him doubt his craft could fail.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“the distance that teaches our shores to speak”); the cartographer remains slightly abstract, but the dancer’s contradictions—exile as home, silence as music—are lived in scene. Final “shoulder-sky” oath crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is felt. A hairline slip: the partner’s interior is ventriloquised once (“trembling like a string”) without dramatized access.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glazier’s interiority is rich—salt-crusted hands, pond-stone counsel, the refusal to shatter glass secrets—yet the moment of highest stakes (convincing investors) is compressed into a future conditional (“I will tell them”) rather than dramatized. Micro-choices (pocketing the boy’s stone, sanding ferry-scarred benches) carry visible cost and anchor the earned stance that ordinary mornings were already luminous. The flaw: we are told the final说服 scene will happen, so the character’s most consequential pressure is off-page. Still, the contradictions—spectacle vs. salvage, chart vs. gossip—are lived in the body and mirrored in the glass, satisfying the 9- gate for contradictory impulses with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific—“cracked cup” voice, fire-forged hands. Bargained innocence drives every beat; micro-choice to open box with her rewrites his debt. Cost is felt: empty porcelain now lighter than guilt. Voice stays singular; no status shift needed—only two people on stone.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “logical dreamer” is vividly interior—every beat is filtered through a precise, idiosyncratic perceptual lens (“needle quivering as if sniffing the invisible wind”). Contradictory impulses (rational calibration vs. mystic communion) coexist in-scene, driving each micro-choice. The final stance—teaching the village a choreography of hope—carries visible cost: relinquishing solitary ownership of the method. Only reservation: the grandmother memory is summoned twice in similar diction, a faint loop that slightly blurs the sole-signature voice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s perceptual acuity (“sensitively perceptive”) drives every micro-choice—pressing an ear to plaster, warming the negative, hop-scotching dust squares—so the trait is more than label; it alters tactics and forecloses retreat, earning the vow’s cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak. The only drag is that the “legacy burden” is felt thematically more than as a visible choice-cost at the exact closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The borrowed-heartbeat conceit gives the narrator a keen, embodied contradiction—carrying a dancer’s pulse yet fearing her own reflection—that stays specific and felt. Micro-choices (breathing to drip tempo, singing coded lullabies) tether interiority to action. The mirage-painter’s calm functions as catalytic mirror rather than full relationship, so crucible pressure is moderate, but the narrator’s final reach to open the window shows credible endurance with cost. Voice remains singular; no stock phrasing or therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The negotiator’s operative gentleness is shown through tactile micro-choices—steady breath, cradling the clipboard, letting argument ride the wind—so motives stay embodied. Interior contradiction surfaces when the same hands that “hold tension without bruising” must weigh a soldier’s demand for penalty against a mother’s demand for horizon, yet the final stance (“work shared”) feels slightly ascribed rather than wrested from a visible internal wound. Still, the character’s patience under fire, the trembling general’s redraft, and the children’s witness all refract back on the negotiator’s hierarchy of values, earning a credible, if quiet, endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philanthropist’s contradictory impulses—financing drought yet hoarding auditory “echoes”—are vividly embodied in the egg-lowering ritual; his spine “slackening” gives visceral cost to the release. Memory of the museum child is concrete, scents the air, and tilts his present stance, anchoring sentiment. Micro-choice to whisper “Release” rather than “Hatch” crystallizes his warped conservation ethic. Interior voice remains distinct, though occasional abstract labels (“amoral,” “sentimental”) approach diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtesan’s interior contradiction—chaste yet complicit in subversion—is dramatized through bodily micro-choices (knot-tying, bare-foot descent) that carry palpable cost. Motive remains consistent: “defy the lullaby of conformity,” intensifying as patrol footsteps approach. The final renunciation—leaving the bowl on the prism—earns its charge because every prior thread-craft foreshadows this surrender of personal safety. Only the childhood-tutor backstory is summary, not embodied, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s shift from complacent puppet-master to follower is dramatized through embodied micro-moments—hands feeling “like tools for theft,” the silent offer of the stick—so the arc is legible and costly. Interiority is character-specific, not diagnostic, and the quiet renunciation at the end is earned. Secondary characters (the woman, the partner) stay off-page long enough to keep the crucible tight; when the woman enters, her single speech rewrites the entire ethic, so status pressure is immediate. Flaws (exploitative satire) are not hedged; the final serenity carries the bruise of that knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s “esoteric realist” label is asserted, not dramatized; no interior contradiction or micro-choice exposes what this stance costs him under pressure. The final promise to “stitch their names from moss and echo” is the first costly act we actually see; prior gestures feel observational. Still, the embodied attention to wing, wind, and knee-press carries credible specificity and a quiet hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is vividly concrete—guilt as molten metal, the mislabeled bell as embodied error—and the final act of letting the bells keep the names (renunciation with cost) flows from the earlier causal chain. Voice-specific perceptual signature is strong. Only micro-gap: we are told “technically gentle” but never shown a moment where that restraint almost fails; the trait is asserted not pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The astronomer’s interiority is precise—counting oil, aligning wires “when a planet rounded the south corner”—and his frugality becomes a moral engine. His pledge to “keep the arithmetic waking each dusk” crystallizes an earned stasis that costs him grandeur yet grants stewardship; the contradiction between mocking rites and counting angles is held in embodied tension. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the solo arc still satisfies the 9+ test because the final renunciation is causally tied to every prior micro-choice of thrift and attention.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s “scheming pacifist” contradiction is vividly embodied—planning mercies with war-like precision—but the interiority drifts into abstract self-labeling (“I am a scheming pacifist”) rather than dramatized suspense. Rell’s arc from clenched courier to kneeling forgiver is credibly painful; the cellular-memory reveal lands because his infant heartbeat is tethered to factory-dust hands. Still, the narrator’s own motives stay static—no micro-choice complicates the pacifist scheme—so the promised internal contradiction never weaponizes a visible mistake or cost. The ending gifts Rell a broken compass, yet the narrator’s stake in that gift is asserted, not tested under shifting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilen’s quiet carpenter pragmatism and Noor’s numerical memory are embodied in every mirror placement and whispered digit; their synchronized breathing under mortal risk shows contradictory impulses (fear of shatter vs need to cradle) in real time. The final transfer of the broken sextant is a micro-choice that crystallizes their hierarchy of values—repair over capture, apprenticeship over loss—paying the felt cost of accepting fracture as form. The only bar to 9+ is that the dream’s interiority is ventriloquized rather than embodied, a hairline slip at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The father’s ache is visceral—clutching the unopened tin, knotting the ribbon into the graft—every beat tying competence to cowardice. Mira’s “dropped-marble” laugh and shove externalize the emotional pivot so the orchard’s release feels like family re-knotted. Quartz eye, pruning hook, and psalter all serve as embodied proxies for parental tools the narrator fears failing with. Cost lands when he leaves the tin shut: renunciation earns the bridge he fashions.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    The curator’s interiority is vivid—his “brightened disquiet” and bathroom epiphanies are character-specific—but the final ingestion of the star-plum feels slightly under-motivated; the aunt’s cameo portraiture supplies the push, yet his active contradiction (curator vs. self-rewriter) could be sharper in the moment of bite. Still, embodied emotion (“cameo ticking like a tiny clock desperate to be a face”) and micro-choices under pressure sustain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The arcane-linguist persona is vivid, consistent, and embodied through sensory micro-choices (warming the leaf, “conjugations like ladders”). Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where linguistic mastery collides with helplessness—so cost feels ornamental rather than personal. The rescue promise supplies motivation, but the final “we continue” renunciation is asserted, not dramatized with visible price to this narrator. Voice specificity almost masks the absence of a tangible flaw that could bleed.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The interiority is lyrically dense and consistent—"chimera twin inside my own tongue" embodies the split—but micro-choices are largely symbolic rather than causal; the decision to plant the empty jar is poetically charged yet not foreclosed by prior stakes, so the renunciation feels atmospheric, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s “warmly methodical” temperament is shown through tactile, patient acts—counting rope turns aloud, resting wax to frame as question—so interiority stays embodied. His motive (translate confusion into clarity) drives every micro-choice and is credibly strained when he refuses to step beyond the landing, paying a visible cost in renunciation. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the internal conflict is announced rather than enacted, keeping him just shy of full contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ripple-mark mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete—she “counts slow taps” and tastes “less brine, more sleep.” A micro-choice under pressure (“I set the echo chamber stone against a rib of calcite”) earns the earned-stasis closure. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible N/A; the single-POV interior contradiction (confidence vs. trembling ribs) is dramatized, not labeled. Flaw—overfull beings—compounds mistake and is accepted with visible cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The custodian’s retrocognitive gift and obsession with meaningful coincidence drive every action; interiority is sensory, concrete, never diagnostic. The renunciation of certainty at the end—accepting stitch over proof—costs him the comfort of closure and is earned by every prior alignment of shard, star map, and prism. Relationships act as crucible only with Lio, but that single bond forces a shared tuning that alters both stances. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc feels inevitable rather than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s interiority is lyrically specific (“preemptively nostalgic,” “tried on the future’s coat”), and the final micro-choice—offering his own plum memory—turns the archive’s one-way flow into a reciprocal act, earning his inclusion in the collective ledger with visible emotional cost. Earlier beats, however, lean on abstract self-interrogation (“What if I was only a binder?”) rather than embodied contradiction; the turn feels more metaphysical than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The designer’s embodied, salt-and-petal alchemy feels idiosyncratic; Lark’s soot-smudged quiet drums against adult competence. Interior contradiction shows when the designer filters memory yet hoards risk. The knot-hand-off crystallizes a status shift and visible cost: Lark’s nascent agency, the designer’s relinquished control. Micro-choices (sniffing rag, singing counts) keep motives visceral; no epiphany speech blunts arc.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicler’s vocation is embodied in every perception; the inland decision is earned through a credible, cost-bearing arc. Interior contradiction—comfort vs. growth—plays out in micro-gestures with the cicada. Relationship pressure is subtle but present; the partner’s silent waiting sharpens the choice. No diagnostic label-speak; the voice stays idiosyncratic and sea-salt specific.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s contradictory fear of walls vs. hunger for weightless quiet is vivid and embodied; the porcelain doll acts as a second heart, externalizing choice. The final sharing with the father turns a private obsession into mutual architectural mercy, a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstract flavour lists that flatten moment-to-moment pressure. Still, the micro-choice to “limit exposure” anchors agency and stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gondola operator’s vocation—teaching silence to comfort—gives every observation a micro-choice (“I dim the cabin light,” “let the gondola slow”) that visibly costs time and altitude. His interior contradiction—measuring hush he can never fully own—ripples through storm-glass watching and cable-drift decisions. The mathematician’s presence supplies external pressure, but the operative’s final renunciation of speed is driven by that night with the singer memory, making the stance earned. Flaw: the climactic “equation is not about proof or grief anymore” is told, not dramatized in his body, blunting the cost brightness a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lore-keeper’s refusal to crown himself is credibly seeded by his early “wish to keep options open”; the final renunciation costs him the ease of algorithmic rule and is felt when the throne stays “nobly empty.” Interiority is concrete—“old ache of libraries” beats diagnostic labels—and the duet-hand pulse with Quin crystallizes a micro-choice hierarchy on the page. Flaws (patience with ghosts, distrust of power) complicate every beat; no stock epiphanies intrude. Relationship-as-crucible is light but present: Quin’s doubt pressures the final shared stewardship, shifting their status from courier-to-equal.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s interior contradiction—drawn to vanish yet refusing others’ vanishing—ramifies in every beat; the micro-choice to withhold the girl’s vanishing crystallizes the arc. Scars as sole conduit translate abstract duty into tactile cost, earning the final quiet step-aside. No stock phrasing; perception stays charcoal-specific, body-bound, moon-cold. The only cap: we never learn why scars became the channel; the lack nicks motivation at the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The survivor backstory fuels the narrator’s distrust of easy profit, but the interiority stays lyric-abstract (“IOU scars that itch”) rather than dramatized micro-choice until the final signature. Embodied emotion peaks when “thumbs shake” while texting; prior beats rely on atmospheric label. The late decision to sign the console and donate the crop earns credible renunciation, yet the flaw-compounding that precedes it is told, not shown. Voice remains consistent, but emotional specificity slips into metaphoric shorthand mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dynasty ender’s interiority is concrete—his throat tightening, the weight of the crank handle—and his renunciation is earned through the ash-confession that rewrites his shame into stewardship. Micro-choices (handing over the seal, pocketing the crank) crystallize a hierarchy of values on the page. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. relief, shame vs. duty—coexist in the same beats, not in summary. The caretaker’s silent staging supplies secondary pressure that forces the protagonist’s final stance, satisfying the relationship crucible without dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The knight’s interiority is gorgeously embodied—gauntlets clicking out choreography, gorget falling so he can “hear the leaves without the ring of metal.” Contradictory impulses (soldier vs. seed-tender) coil inside every beat; the final murmured allegiance is earned by the mother-memory cue and the tongue-pressed kernel. No stock phrasing; even static is tasted. Micro-choices (climb, unsnap, taste) chart a visible hierarchy of values. Closure cost is the thunder he will no longer give the world—felt in the hush after theater bells.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s contradictory impulses—broken-hearted yet tactfully hopeful—are lived through concrete micro-choices: noticing dust, opening the box, typing the addendum. Each action is shaded by interior cost (“my heart still hurt”), and the final envelope is a renunciation with visible price. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through a precise, idiosyncratic perceptual lens. The motivation escalates from passive cataloguing to an active rewriting of Micah’s ending, earned by the breadcrumb trail.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s understated competence and filial loyalty are vivid; her quiet micro-choices (pocketing the key, humming the shutdown) embody “carefully resourceful” with cost. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The hinge-line “she would be the hinge, the turn” crystallizes earned identity shift. No contradictory impulse on-page keeps this just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The saxophonist’s interiority is concrete—hands tremor, breath feathers, memory tastes of iron—yet the only contradiction shown is between duty and grief, never fully crystallized into a visible mistake. The final endurance costs him nothing we haven’t already been told; the oath holds, but we don’t feel it chafe. Still, the embodied micro-choices under pressure keep the portrait individual and alive.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The seed-sorter’s quiet, ritualized agency is credibly embodied; the moonstone’s warming and the decision to “prod myself” dramatize contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation—knowing the hearer, not the leaf, is transformed—carries visible cost in the dawn descent with ash-flecked hair. Interiority stays concrete and moss-bitter; no therapy-speak intrudes. The only cap is the gentle scope: no second character onstage, so relationship crucible and status dynamics cannot test higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The interior voice is specific, poetically compressed, and consistent—"time flinches when touched," "brass teaches: improvise with patience." The arc from exactness-chaser to cascade-listener is credibly embodied; cost is the abandoned old workshop ethos. Minor deduction: the "uncertainly certain" tag is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices, but the climatic stance crystallization still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    The alchemist’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals—etching names, weighing rain-water against brass—so interiority stays concrete. The flaw is that Mara remains a golden abstraction; no contradictory memory or live detail complicates the narrator’s myth of her, so the internal conflict is single-track. The final stance (“I am not healed, but I am held together”) is earned: the fused coin physically forecloses the fantasy of retrieval, forcing Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “gardener of untended laughter” vocation is vividly particular, and the crocodile-tooth talisman embodies survival-turned-promise, but the sole on-page decision—plucking the harp to coax the woman’s laugh—arrives late and without visible trade-off; interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, so the renunciation feels gently asserted, not paid for with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The survivor’s interior contradiction—needing the mask strap as both leash and lifeline—grounds every beat; the final knot around the branch is a credible renunciation with embodied cost. Proprioceptive gift is more label than lived torque until late, blunting early micro-choices. Still, the hierarchy of values (name vs screw-turn) is legible and paid for in ultraviolet flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s translator vocation is lived through sensory synesthesia and micro-choices (“I swallowed two worlds”), but interior contradiction is more asserted than dramatized; the final naming act is tender yet feels lightly earned because the child’s stake is revealed only at the close. Flawed passivity fits the lyric mode, so no deduction, yet the absence of a visible cost to the narrator keeps this shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s vocation and ghost-negotiating habit are vivid, but the interior contradiction between duty (fixing elevators) and compulsion (hunting ceilings) is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice to wind the barrel backward is credibly earned, yet the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    The operator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the perfect moment while knowing perfection sinks the library—are dramatized in every micro-choice; the decision to print the eternity-compressing clause is earned by the whisper’s tactile return and the childhood memory of his mother’s fall, paying the cost of renewed loneliness and perpetual asymmetry. Interiority is embodied in frost on glass skin and ink warmed by breath, never label-speak. The final renunciation of stasis for buoyant wobble is visible in the sand still falling inside the pressed circle, a felt price that forecloses any future attempt at flawless equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s poet-revolutionary identity is vividly embodied in every perceptual beat; hunger for a usable past drives every micro-choice, from pocketing the shard to the public readings. Interior contradiction is palpable: the same man who once hid from soldiers now courts visibility, yet clings to a childhood superstition, exposing both longing and tactical caution. The final bow of sorrow when the shard cracks is earned—his revolution stays dead, but the stance he carved (listening instead of leading) costs him the last talisman. Ledger functions as living pressure, not caricature; their status duel in council hall crystallizes without sidelining the protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyric and embodied (“knuckles to rain,” “bones softening like wax”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are stated more than enacted in scene; the confession of selling a lullaby is the only beat where interior conflict visibly alters tactics. The final renunciation (giving his shadow) carries felt cost and is consonant with the established moral allergy to dishonesty, earning the change. Still, we get only one micro-choice on the page; the rest is retrospective summary, keeping it below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is consistently specific—e.g., “sensibly eccentric, preferring lists and boots”—and the micro-choice to float the compass-shoe is a credible renunciation that clicks open grief. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; the flaw (clinging to failure as map) could be more actively hazardous on-page. The scarf-memory knot is a lovely embodiment of love → courage, yet the father-widow reveal is delivered in flash exposition rather than forcing a present-tense choice. Overall, a strong arc of Earned Stasis, but the emotional cost is more declared than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s sculptor identity is vivid in the opening beats—“reads knots the way others read lines on palms”—and the lantern-slide kinship-net later forces a concrete micro-choice under the arch. Interiority stays embodied, but the emotional crescendo leans on thematic shorthand (“a vow to keep building bridges out of broken weather”) rather than a final, specific bodily cost; the Earned Stasis is felt yet not sharpened to a singe image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artist’s curiosity about why flowers bloom at night drives every beat and pigment; her interiority remains sensorial (“felt a hush move under it like a cat between rails”) without slipping into label-speak. Micro-choices—climbing the scaffold, waiting for twilight, grinding pigments past midnight—embody the “quietly driven” trait with visible stamina cost. The grandmother’s postcards function as an extension of character memory, tilting present tactics rather than serving as static backstory. Closure is an earned stasis: she foregoes certainty yet gains ancestral alignment, the cost felt in the final hand-steadying image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The archivist’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—“I catalog history to keep it from drowning again”—and every micro-choice (kneeling to the lagoon, feeding the diary) is driven by a legible, escalating need to surface erased truth. The grandmother’s circular hand-off of the letters and diary crystallizes inherited obligation as a lived cost, not an abstract duty. Flaws (obsession, willingness to be scalded) actively complicate the final stance, and the renunciation of relief for tension is earned and painful. Voice remains singular, never sliding into civic rhetoric; even the clerk’s apology is filtered through the narrator’s perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    Iria’s refusal of easy miracles and her insistence on labor-based revival are dramatized through concrete micro-choices—writing the charter with kelp ink, setting the bell, teaching the sailor to count thoughts—so her “rejects false comfort” trait is lived, not labeled. The interior contradiction between her longing for magic and her discipline of renunciation stays active in scene, powering the final renunciation of wishes. Cost is visible: she loses solitude, accepts endless rehearsal, and relinquishes omnipotence. The amber bottle acts as an externalized heart whose ticking she feels, anchoring emotion in object rather than abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scribe’s interior contradiction—record vs. refuse the harmful oath—drives every beat; the final renunciation costs the future archive, visible in the folded, rain-softened parchment. Micro-choices (shaving the wax, releasing the stylus) embody the conflict; embodied emotion (“pin in my breath”) recurs with credibility. No status or relationship crucible is on-page, so those bullets are waived; single-POV interiority stays specific and flawed. The 9+ gate fails only because the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    A lone, embodied consciousness whose quiet, tactile devotion to seeds and spirals feels genetically consistent; the “furiously tranquil” hands are shown in steady action rather than told. Interiority stays concrete (“cupping the newborn vortex like a candle flame”) and the final stance—renunciation of ownership—carries visible cost in the planting of the cap. Missing only a sharper contradiction under pressure to reach 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “credibly curious” trait is shown, not told, through the choice to listen rather than flip the switch; the micro-choice to delay until the glue dries and then test the rope by hand earns the later payoff. Interior contradiction is alive—“listening distinguishes between thunder and rumor”—yet emotional embodiment occasionally veers into lyric over-abstraction (“the sanctuary hummed like an empty lung”). Still, the final renunciation of sirens for the bell’s “good restraint” carries visible cost in the valley station’s baffled reply, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor compression at the line level keeps it just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The janitor’s interiority is rich—transparent under starlight, kneeling to panel hums, speaking names of dead engineers—but the arc is a steady deepening rather than a sharp turn; the final “gentler beat” is payoff yet not a fork that forecloses a path, so the cost feels contemplative rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    The recluse’s astonished passivity is consistent and thematically apt, but his agency is almost entirely interior; the single micro-choice—opening the box fully to the queen—reads as ceremonial surrender rather than a fork that costs him anything concrete. His “tranquilly perceptive” stance is shown through sensory attention, yet the lack of embodied contradiction under pressure keeps the arc just shy of a fully earned turn. Still, the quiet endurance fits the accumulative lens and the final image of “pollen on its mouth” gives his stance a resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly textured—time felt by smell, grain-shadows, a heart “on loan” that learns to listen rather than tick—yet the arc stays inside the single stance of witness-helper; the earned shift is the quiet switch from counting to listening, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the change feels contemplative rather than costly. Lio functions more as echo than crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. Still, the voice is so particular that the solitude itself becomes character, and the final boot-posting shows micro-choice altering community rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interiority is richly textured through sensory attention and micro-choices (kneeling to write, threading ribbon), but the boy’s turn from stunned loss to “new listening” is asserted more than embodied; one more beat of visible internal contradiction would have pushed this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The caretaker’s interior contradiction—accepting death yet sweating to remake the orchard—surfaces in every micro-choice (copper loop, otter ramp, diary smudge). Embodied emotion (“my breath grew thin”) and mineral taste of almond pollen ground the arc. The final renunciation—laying the diary under the oak—pays the full cost of mortality while enshrining interspecies respect. Voice stays individual, never drifts into caretaker cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” identity is dramatized in mini-choices—declining ritual, offering amber, the raised-eyebrow dissent—each tightening the stance. Interiority stays embodied (breath slows, skin oils react) rather than abstract. The final renunciation of nostalgia is earned by the prior lab-bench distrust of ceremony, giving closure visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coachman’s quiet, ritualized agency is rendered through embodied micro-choices (thumb finding the pod seam, stacking bayonets into lattice) that externalize a layered interior contradiction: penance through cultivation. His motive—growth as apology—remains stable yet deepens via tactile repetitions, and the final image of crossing “narrow as mercy” crystallizes earned renunciation with visible cost (empty pods stored for tomorrow). No secondary character pressure is on stage, so relationship crucible is waived; interiority alone carries the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Protagonist’s voice-driven ledger-keeping and Harbor’s nose-driven guidance both manifest in embodied, scene-level choices; the decision to light the leaf over the cylinder is an earned micro-choice that forecloses the safe dusk and risks the relay. Interiority stays concrete—“I tried to translate distance into closeness” grounds the abstract want in tactile action. The only minor drag: “intuitively descriptive ledger keeper” is label-speak not yet dramatized when introduced, but the wax-leaf cataloguing that follows quickly redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—guilt, pride, isolation, the need to keep drawing—are embodied in every beat; the compass rose and the slow sky act as tangible extensions of that conflict. Micro-choices (pulling the safeties, dating the blackout, blowing on the ink) carry visible cost and foreclose the path back to social acceptance. The “blessed pariah” status is dramatized, not labeled, through the board’s wary distance and the city’s slow lights. Emotional progression feels lived-in: shame layers into ritual, then into a self-authored navigation that accepts its own exile.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The thief’s vow to “take only what harm has taken first” is repeatedly stress-tested by the tactile act of swapping chess pieces that hold living weather-vows; each micro-choice (knight, rook, bishop, queen) embodies a visible hierarchy of values where returning summer, hunger, or mercy costs him trembling certainty. Interiority stays concrete—“my gloves shook” under sacred play—and the final earned stance (“my hands still belong to mending”) forecloses the easier path of theft, paying with a promised itinerant silence. Flaws (compulsion to play, fear of dissonance) directly complicate tactics; no therapeutic self-labeling intrudes. The closing image crystallizes a believable renunciation that is causally seeded by every hollowed piece he handled.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The survivor-turned-historian stance is vivid; the narrator’s refusal to remain a pawn (“I will travel with the nomadic penumbra”) crystallizes a credible, earned renunciation. Micro-choices—cutting apologies, steadying elbows, surrendering the lantern—embody the benevolent ruthlessness without explanatory labels. Interiority stays concrete: “the real blast braided my lungs with phrases no director could erase” fuses memory and breath. Only the late reveal of the coat-button comet lacks prior seeding, slightly thinning the cost ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through synesthetic recall (feather-barbed syllables, stone-warm recognition); the micro-choice to speak the “first true hello” crystallizes a credible renunciation of shame. Motive remains consistent: regain voice → pay with pain → seed new tongue. The seer acts as secondary pressure, forcing trade-offs; yet her own stakes stay off-page, capping at 8.6.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The exiled tutor’s guilt is viscerally embodied in the frozen village; every micro-choice (touching threads, counting knight-steps) externalizes self-forgiveness as a literal unweaving of time. Interior contradiction—strategic detachment vs. remembered pity—drives each tug of thread. The final renunciation of instant release carries visible cost: he dooms himself to lingering memory (the pigeons stay frozen) and the choice is earned by the prior chain of causality. Flaw: “strategy must ignore pity” edges toward diagnostic label-speak; a −0.3 there keeps this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The artist’s contradictory drive—to atone yet rewrite the ritual—surfaces in the tactile moment he volunteers to pay double for the child; the gesture crystallizes prior guilt and costs him his mentor’s gold, a visible forfeiture that lands as earned change. Interiority stays concrete (“felt the weight inside him at last unclench”) and avoids label-speak. The child’s mischievous innocence pressures the adult’s stance without slipping into symbolic prop. One hairline slip: the mentor backstory is summary, not dramatized, but the present choice already carries the freight.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s interiority is textured through salt-solder tremors and the ritual of dunking his head into the cistern; contradictory impulses—duty to Mira vs. survival—co-exist in-scene. The micro-choice to solder the gold seam under the engine’s glow shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Motivation stays anchored to the promise/lead-in-chest metaphor, earning the final renunciation of certainty. Voice specificity and embodied emotion almost reach the 9-band, but the epiphanic last paragraph edges toward diagnostic self-labeling (“uncertain alchemist who has learned…”) rather than pure dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s refusal to live inside the painting is earned: every micro-choice (dipping the shell, drawing the submerged quay, walking away) visibly trades the ecstasy of merger for the discipline of witness. The “intimately aloof” trait is not label-only; it is acted out in the renunciation scene where proximity to the pool’s eternity is rejected. Cost is legible in the cracked mirror kept broken—an externalized scar of the split self. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak; the voice’s perceptual signature (salt ghosts, mineral syllables) is consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The assistant keeper’s contradiction—yearning to whisper yet needing proof—drives every beat; the grandmother’s vial cork steadies breath and choice, its cost felt when pressed to lips while the captain passes. Interiority is embodied (“vial warm with my patience”) and degraded under pressure as salt, gulls, and dew narrow perception. One micro-choice—hum, scent, circle—crystallizes values and forecloses shouting. Mentor’s late silence confirms witness; relationship shifts without head-count clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The navigator’s grief-riven agency stays concrete—wrapping the censer foot, walking the flats, choosing to keep building—yet interiority occasionally stoops to label-speak (“the ache,” “raw solace”) that flattens embodied contradiction; still, the final micro-choice to draw the line over the heart costs him a future of certainty, earning the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s rational, truth-bound persona is vividly embodied in micro-choices—smearing clay to hide the eye, deciding what honesty need not reveal—yet the interior contradiction between evidence-seeking and relic-faith could be pushed further under patrol threat. The final “eye grows warm” moment registers earned endurance, but the cost feels lightly weighted against the stakes already survived.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The keeper’s “observe gaps” method is embodied in every beat: crouching to the notch, matching stem to wear, sweeping the plank to hide the shrine. His contradictory impulses—grief-archivist vs. living signalman—co-exist in scene, never abstracted. The final choice (lantern swing that may only mirror himself) is renunciation earned by the dock’s prior ledger of pain; cost is visible in the salt packet pressed into the page. Voice remains个体, never lighthouse cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—loneliness vs empirical intuition, maps vs ants, stillness vs stepping through. The final choice to pocket the chip and cross the ant-bridge dramatizes renunciation with shin-level cold cost; no diagnostic label-speak. Micro-choices (watching ants, pressing chip, removing it) reveal value hierarchy and flaw: refusal to let the door choose for him. Voice-specific perceptual signature—elevation lines “curl like sleeping cats,” typesmoke scent—anchors character throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lush but occasionally drifts into lyrical self-exposition (“a net asking to be filled with answers”) rather than embodied contradiction. The queen’s renunciation is signaled early yet the climactic choice to merge with her stone double is accepted too smoothly; the cost is poetic but not dramatized in a visible wound or forfeiture. The wanderer’s cryptic guidance supplies external pressure, yet his stake remains opaque, so the queen’s final yes feels slightly under-earned. Still, her voice is distinct and the dream-motive is relentlessly pursued.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “scientifically romantic” narrator shows a layered interiority—equations that rhyme, pocket-sun ethics—yet never tips into self-diagnosis. Micro-choices (striking phosphorus, cupping the thimble of proof) externalize the internal contradiction between wonder and methodology. The relationship crucible with the friend is palpable: status shifts from tease to co-witness under shared risk. Only a hairline slip: the final “promise to keep the chamber open” is voiced in summary, not dramatized, so the cost feels fractionally softer than the earned stasis demands.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lucid-dream chronicler’s contradictory impulses—cartographing chaos while craving narrative heat—are dramatized in embodied, idiosyncratic interiority (“jealous of past selves until the present brightened like magnesium”). Micro-choices (tracing ants-off-the-bark letters, trading envy for a syllable) visibly tilt tactics under pressure. The final renunciation—walking forward while chronologically scrambled—pays the accumulated cost of envy and confusion with earned stasis. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; hunger for continuity stays visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific; the aromatherapist-turned-clock-tender’s synesthetic substitution of smell for emotional “listening” is traced through tactile micro-choices—sweeping, fitting the screw, guiding the father’s hand. Contradictory impulses (need to control time vs. surrender to its drip) coil inside every beat. The final stance—cupping the restored clepsydra like a newborn—crystallizes an earned reconfiguration with visible cost: the shop door stays unlatched, the narrator exposed to every future dawn. Only minor hedge: the grandmother-midwife backstory is told, not dramatized, so the emotional risk feels fractionally cooler than the present-tense stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and body-anchored; the scholar’s earnest errors surface in micro-choices (hand-steadying, sip counting, crow-quill dip). Each scar rune externalizes a private contradiction; the final bow to her younger self crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost in breath and burn. No therapy-speak; voice stays idiosyncratic and flawed. Could nudge to 9+ if one earlier choice risked immediate platform failure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s guilt-driven compulsion is embodied in every tactile detail (the rewired atomizer, the copper wire around the piano leg), and the micro-choice to phone the foreman crystallizes a hierarchy of values: public penance over private absolution. Contradictory impulses—self-loathing vs. the hunger for redemption—coexist in the same beats, never summarized away. The final “clumsy nocturne” is a renunciation that costs him his last shield of irony, earned by every prior failed metaphor. Only the absence of Mara’s live counter-pressure keeps this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lone narrator’s contradictory impulses—desire to judge vs. need to listen—are embodied in the dictionary-handling beats and the final renunciation of verdict. Interiority is concrete (“dictionary cracked softly”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The earned hinge-stance costs certainty and is legible in the last marginal note.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s quiet obsession with “what clocks really measure” drives every micro-choice; the wound-and-key beat embodies contradictory impulses (tenderness vs. heresy) and prints a literal cost on the object. Interiority stays concrete—“I pressed the wound to the key”—never abstract, and the final renunciation of correction is earned by the prior valve-tweaking and backward counting. Voice remains singular, not stock; no diagnostic self-talk. The grandmother memory is anchored in present stimuli and alters stance, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—needing control while learning release—drives every micro-choice; her spatial gift is more than label, it choreographs the cat’s path and her own emotional lattice. Grief for Kian is embodied in the shovel-strut fix, not named, and her competence is balanced by the visible cost of loosening her grip. The final stance crystallizes with earned cost: she powers down the rig, accepting permeable vigilance. No stock interiority; even “physics of letting go” is tested through fungal sensor data and feral-cat diplomacy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory inheritance—mathematical rigor versus gambler’s intuition—drives every micro-choice; the lantern moment crystallizes a creed she both trusts and doubts, costing her the safety of pure skepticism. Embodied emotion (“tug, a lucid contradiction settling like a bird”) is precise, not diagnostic. The racetrack-stub note rewrites her teaching agenda, an earned renunciation of detached theory. All interiority is filtered through probability idiom, keeping voice and motive indivisible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to connect yet refusing to step through the door she opens for others—are dramatized in the moment she routes the trapped child through Rojo and Flora while keeping herself outside the frame. The glass-disc touch anchoring each micro-choice shows embodied emotion without label-speak. Her final stance of cultivated estrangement is earned: the cost is the perpetual exile she elects in the last paragraph, visible in the image of her “standing” while “endings walk upstairs together.” Interiority stays concrete and vocation-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Archivist’s “preserve small moments” motive is concrete from line 1 and steers every micro-choice; interiority stays sensory (“salt behind my eyes”) not diagnostic. No contradictory impulse under pressure—passivity is intentional yet costs remain felt (stepping back, sealing with salt). Relationship crucible is off-stage; woman & man are secondary, so status/pressure bullets NA. Meets 9+ test only if renunciation carried higher visible price; still, motive→action alignment is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The logistician’s “desperately jocular” fatigue is vivid in early lines, but interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice; the smile stays a label rather than a lever. The child who pockets the moon rock at the end is the only figure who undergoes a legible shift, and that moment is off-stage from the POV. Because the narrator’s own stake in reciprocity is asserted rather than dramatized, the emotional cost is felt second-hand. Still, the cast’s collective performance of kindness is specific enough to keep the score in the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    The blind mapmaker’s interiority is vividly embodied—touch-reading lichens, dowsing with a trembling ring—yet the arc is more accumulative than decisively changed. Grief is confessed but not complicated by contradictory impulse; the final “axis” acceptance feels arrived at through lyric accretion rather than a costly renunciation forged under pressure. Still, the sensory specificity and occupational blindness keep the portrait individuated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s “confidently uncertain” persona is shown through concrete micro-choices—trading farms for stars, pressing the pen to his wrist—rather than labels. The interior contradiction (guilt vs. longing for meaning) drives every beat, and the final acceptance of edited history is earned by the causal chain of listening, translating, writing. Still, the mentor remains a functional device rather than a second crucible, so relationship pressure is one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Arin’s motive—turning silence into music—stays legible, but the “quietly charismatic” label is never tested by any social friction; the advisor’s whispered prompts supply the only external pressure, so Arin’s interiority stays abstract. The embodied contradictions we need (joyful sorrow) are declared, not dramatized through micro-choice. Still, the renunciation of applause and the empty camera create a visible cost, earning a partial Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “analytically intuitive” curse/compass is concrete in every beat—threading fragment to canvas, decoding murals, feeling “the tug of her mind.” Arson-to-rebirth motivation escalates cleanly; the final carried portrait is earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak; volcanic tenderness is shown via soot lifting, seeds writing names. Minor slip: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible unused, but single-POV pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s quietly rebellious stance is shown through embodied micro-choices—drumming on rails, stealing blind spots, kneeling to tap a private rhythm—each tethered to the entangled-love stake. Interiority is concrete (“ribs hollowed like flutes”) and contradictions glow: compliance offered as roses while plotting inversion. The final shared awakening is earned by this drum-code courtship; cost is felt when cuffs click and donor memories are accepted. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; every image is particular to this guinea-pig lover.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ivo’s “walk-reader” gift is vivid and embodied; his micro-choice to scrape knuckle for metallic weather shows bodily attention. The zodiac coin works as a pause-button, not a magic talisman—its reappearance at the jammed gate ties internal rhythm to external fix. Interior contradiction is light: he never doubts his method, so the arc is competence, not growth; this caps emotional cost at “quiet nod.” Still, the renunciation of shouting earns its place because the port’s social credit visibly shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s grief over his brother’s suicide is viscerally embodied (cold hand, withheld secret). The guardian’s silence and “spiralingly calm” demeanor remain consistent yet cryptic, creating credible mystery. Interior contradiction surfaces when shame retreats yet the brother’s refusal still aches—both states held simultaneously. The micro-choice to accept the mirror and angle it at the arches crystallizes a hierarchy of values: speak light where speech failed before. Cost is legible—“the night bruises easily,” the brother’s refusal felt as a lifted door—yet the guardian’s motives stay opaque, blocking full 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coach’s interiority is rich—"title never fit my shoes" and "chest felt like open ground" are concrete, embodied contradictions. Micro-choices (window scheme, stalemate choreography) flow from the quiet-rebel motive. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays coherent. The final renunciation—leave the grotto "as carefully as we found it"—pays off the earlier fear of trampling, cost felt in the slowed walk home.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dock-worker narrator’s contradictory self-image (“grace is what I hide in my muscles,” “hardshell” vs. the sunlight-bending name) is embodied in every beat: micro-choices such as threading mooring lines through the belt as “meanings,” the decision to speak the unapologetic name aloud, and the final offer to ferry the townsfolk back. Interior conflict stays concrete—fear of softness versus need to be seen—and the renunciation of guardedness carries visible social cost as the crowd watches in “heavy silence.” Voice and muscle memory integrate; no therapeutic paraphrasing. The only bar to 9+ is that the crowd remains an anonymous chorus, so status dynamics are inferred rather than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The blank-faced performer’s refusal to smile while still monetizing neutrality is a lived contradiction; every beat of “narrating the sink” dramatizes this. Interiority is precise: “blank face is my costume and my insurance” reveals hierarchy of values under surveillance. Micro-choice of letting child hold brittle stem crystallizes endurance with visible cost. No stock therapy-speak; even “moral ambiguity” is immediately ironized by manager’s token count.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The collective “we” generates a diffuse, shifting interiority; while contradictory impulses flicker (“unsure whether to sing or remain discreetly rooted”), no single character’s micro-choice visibly costs them. The guard’s badge drop is emotionally legible but elided—the beat is summarized, not dramatized—so the renunciation feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ivo’s synesthesia-by-touch and plant-grammar are vivid, but his internal contradiction—wanting imperfection yet trading his “best brush”—is only asserted, not dramatized in a moment where the two impulses collide. The final “no longer searching” feels tidy; we are told the song finds him rather than watching a micro-choice that surrenders control. Mira remains functional, a kindly gatekeeper rather than a crucible who forces a status shift. The cost (his old painterly identity) is named, not embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism-song bell ringer’s interiority is rich and embodied—“my hands are powerfully gentle” fuses vocation and vulnerability. Micro-choices (unlocking the iron cabinet, polishing the lens, ringing the crystal city bell) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—pilgrimage without destination—earns resonance because earlier tactile acts foreshadow the acceptance of open-ended repair. Cost is palpable: the lingering moonlight on palms signals the eternal, unsolved labor of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Grief-struck jeweler’s interiority is vivid—metal that “clouded over” embodies loss; micro-choices (projecting stencil, soldering wire around hesitation) show hierarchy of values. Endurance of running nightly “observatory church” is earned renunciation with felt cost (patience, sleep, livelihood). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible exempt; occupational detail (mourning jewelry, solder, vellum) is germane and specific. Slight safety-hedge: tactile pain or bodily risk never pushed to extreme, keeping flaw human-scaled rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The apprentice’s “steady curiosity” drives tactile micro-choices—touching cards, holding tape—that anchor point-of-view and motivate every beat; interiority stays sensory (“rainlight,” “hiss of tape”) rather than diagnostic. No contradiction is dramatized inside a single high-pressure beat, so the hoped-for escalation of internal conflict is only implied; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is more communal than personal, capping intensity just under 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The historian’s desire for forbidden knowledge is vividly interior (“hunger of drought”), but the only choice that visibly costs her is the refusal to bargain with the tablets; the final “alignment” remains abstract rather than embodied. The bronze child functions as a catalyst, not a crucible, so relational pressure is muted. Still, the micro-choice of irregular steps to evade the archive’s pattern is specific and character-particular, earning the high-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s gently obsessive caretaker interiority is vivid—her pocketed river-stone ritual embodies contradictory needs for weight and drift. The bargain she strikes, sacrificing her bottled dream-life to free Ilen’s shadow, is a micro-choice that reweights her hierarchy of values on the page. The only friction is that Ilen’s pressure on her is reported rather than enacted in scene, muting the crucible intensity this length demands.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—wanting to be gentle yet cutting the tail—lands with embodied tremor and micro-choices (warming forceps, murmuring, logging). The refusal to moralize keeps flaws alive; the final stance crystallizes under visible cost (dead tail in tray, donor letter signed). Slight over-articulation of motive in “balance self-respect and compassion” keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—seeking closure yet compelled to reopen wounds—stays active in every beat; the plant-telepathy gift is not merely labeled but used to tunnel, read fossil rings, and decide to plant ivy in the crater. Emotion stays embodied: numb fingers, cold glass pressed to wrists, “tasting loam and apology.” The final micro-choice—shatter hourglass, plant ivy—pays off the prior causality and costs her the relic, earning the shift toward “garden I will learn.” Voice occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction (“meteor hush,” “leaf rhythms”) that dilutes specificity, keeping it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrically dense but stays character-specific; the “warehouse of feelings” metaphor gives her a distinct perceptual lens. The key-ring box and self-addressed letters supply a late, credible micro-choice that costs her self-image. Emotional embodiment is strong—frost-nib wrist, projector’s growl—but the flaw→cost link is more asserted than dramatized before the final aisle. Still, the renunciation of wandering reads as earned within the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is richly concrete—“brass chilled and calibrated by sleeplessness” embodies motive; the contradiction between craving silence and being doomed to hear is dramatized in every beat. Micro-choices (aligning the sight, whispering to the night, choosing to sleep inside the arch) visibly tilt the stake. The final endurance—shouldering the instrument for perpetual rounds—pays the cost of eternal service, fulfilling Earned Stasis. Only minus: the proclaimed “gift or curse” skirts diagnostic self-labeling, though the body of text instantly re-embodies the claim.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The guard’s motive—“cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners”—is stated early and every beat returns to it, so agency stays legible. Yet the archive’s quasi-sentient responses give him near-limitless permission; because external resistance is dreamlike and negotiable, the cost to him feels symbolic rather than bodily, so the final endurance reads as serene, not scarred. Interior contradiction is present but thin: he never fears failure or questions the archive’s right to exist, so the “breathing into the bottle” moment, while lovely, is not wrested from competing desires. Still, the voice’s grave tenderness and the micro-choice of pacing the gravel to “let the miles remember” keep the portrait above stock allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The interiority is rich, concrete, and voice-specific (“I am a stray philosopher… I never arrive where I expect”). Micro-choices—pressing the gear home, choosing to descend—are dramatized and carry cost. Emotion stays embodied; no label-speak. Flaws are implied but not tested hard; the arc is calibrated, not conflicted, so the 9-bar isn’t quite reached.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is textured and embodied—kneeling to the ridge, feeling the star warm in the palm—but the guides remain symbolic instruments rather than pressure agents; no contradiction is staged between them, so the relationship crucible is dormant. The final reach for courage is credibly prepared by the vigil beat and the persistent shimmer at the ankles, earning the Earned Stasis with cost: the skiff nested inside the ribs is a visceral forfeiture of pure return. Still, the guides’ dialogue drifts toward maxim-speak (“no wrong, only unfinished”) that slightly flattens individual voice. Overall, a strong single-POV arc of hesitancy-to-carry, but secondary characters do not exert status or tactical force.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—accepting pain as metronome while seeking harmony—grounds every beat; the final refusal to forgive silence is earned through the bolt-fix and the wrist’s shrinking shocks. Micro-choices (pocketing the bolt, sitting the bench, breathing shape into glass) reveal a hierarchy of values: steadiness over speech, listening over safety. The bellhop’s gestural pressure supplies external status tension, forcing the narrator to convert injury into choral attention. Cost is visible: nerves write shorter letters, the fortress exhales a “warmer kind of rule,” yet silence remains—an unforgiven guard now tolerated rather than obeyed.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyr’s “diminutive titan” contradiction is embodied: he writes, waits, arranges mirrors—power through patience. His patched robe and tin reliquary anchor interiority without exposition; the micro-choice to open the pellet box charges the climax. Serane’s arc is equally tactile—the ink climbing her finger externalizes identity collapse. Both characters show contradictory impulses simultaneously (pride/terror, pity/resolve) and pay a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s motivation—tracing vanished footpaths—remains steady and personal; every micro-choice (tapping, radioing the village, pressing Assemble) flows from that want. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic: “my vertebrae were lanterns gatehinged to the sea” embodies loss and responsibility without naming feelings. The final endurance—rewriting beats onto the orphaned atlas page—carries visible cost: acceptance that maps must stay loose-leaf. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, so the score stops just short of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s barefoot awkward confidence, opera-glass ritual, and circuit-closing gesture embody a believable interior contradiction; the hum she courts is both filial and political, so her choice to broadcast the map lands as earned cost. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relational/status dynamics off the table, but her micro-choices—kneeling, speaking to stones, skin-bridging the circuit—trace a visible hierarchy of values. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts choices; no stock epiphanies. Only the father’s disappearance is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the backstory fraction just under the 20 % ceiling, so the flaw is a hairline, not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lida’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her knees “turn to memory,” the vine “borrows breath.” The contradiction between reverence for tradition and insurgent action is active in-scene, but the final swing to communal triumph feels slightly too tidy; the cost is poetic rather than palpable. The micro-choice to lift the amber is well-motivated, yet the council’s refusal is compressed into reported summary, muting secondary-character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rafi’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—his freeze response is never clinical, always visceral. The photograph and the grafting knife act as extensions of his memory and agency, forcing micro-choices that cost him breath and bearing. His renunciation of heroic narrative in favor of “rooms storms can enter” is earned by every prior somatic marker. The only minor slip is the niece’s late appearance; her function is more thematic conduit than crucible, slightly blunting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—needing darkness yet craving a wick—is embodied in every tactile micro-choice (threading cards, braiding wick). The crestfallen artist flaw drives her to salvage a lighthouse she doesn’t own, compounding risk. Final endurance (“I will keep the light tonight”) costs her the safety of anonymity; causality intact, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The albino tracker’s refusal of the throne is earned by the mentor memory and the ink-river lie-down; cost is the self-erasure that leaves only a hollow for the bird to learn. Interiority is concrete—“question lodged under my ribs,” “body becomes a levee”—and the serene anger modulates under pressure. Micro-choices (spill second vial, lie in ink, refuse throne) reveal hierarchy of values. Flaw: no contradiction shown inside the final chamber; stance crystallizes but we do not feel the tug to accept.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s contradictory drives—preservation vs. liberation—are embodied in the micro-choice to warm the seal with his own breath and later to thread the letter through the ducts. Interiority stays concrete (“I could taste heat”) and the final renunciation of certainty (“I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free”) carries visible cost. The only bar to 9+ is that the external stakes never quite pierce the lyric veil; the city remains a silhouette rather than a second character pressing back.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pacifist-daughter persona is vivid: her refusal to track, her whispered stories into irrigation tubes, her micro-choice to tie the sandbag scrap to a rose all embody an earned, costly gentleness. Interiority stays concrete (“hands remember restraint,” “thirst makes derision soften”) and her final vow to keep the farm open is the believable culmination of every prior decision. The only hairline slip: the father’s off-stage motives remain slightly opaque, so the emotional cost of his absence is felt more through her than through shared contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fisher’s calm-as-net persona stays consistent; every action (gripping the spike, planting it, letting the map spill back) flows from that trait and costs him his hoarded silence. Interiority is sensuous rather than diagnostic—brine on sleeves, patience in mouth. The only flaw: the “listener with salt for a tongue” retort feels slightly writerly, not yet earned by prior diction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—ink-scented nib vs. father’s deadlines—embodied in trembling lens. Micro-choice to seal shutters crystallizes values; cost lands when markets hiccup. Caretaker’s “orbits of regret” speech risks diagnostic-speak but is saved by dust-threaded beard and sleeved thumbs. Flaw: caretaker’s late exposition slightly over-articulates; still, heir’s refusal to retreat charges Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—guilt manifests as waveform, ink, insect wing. The narrator’s contradictory impulse to map forward while refusing to leave the lab crystallizes under pressure; the final tattoo on his own pulse is credible renunciation. One minor slip: the “girl whose laugh had not yet begun” is asserted not dramatized, blunting the cost of abandonment. Still, the micro-choice to ink himself with the two-star glyph visibly forecloses escape and earns stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s “socially perceptive” label is asserted early but only once dramatized—when she nudges the bearded man’s pebble—does it alter the mandala’s chemistry. Interiority is lyrically textured yet distances emotion through abstraction (“chest veer, a kite tugging”). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the shift from observer to mild conduit feels smooth rather than costly. Closure is a collective hush riding home, so the personal arc plateaus at observer-moderator rather than tested agent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gentle radical’s contradiction—steel arms cradling empathy—remains embodied in every beat: kneeling to tesserae, trading bottle caps for a name, forcing renamed men to kneel. Interiority stays concrete (“my memory opens like a wound”) and the final loosening of the past is earned by the mosaic ritual that precedes it. The only bar to 9+ is that the boy and the four men are sketched more as functions than crucibles; the protagonist carries almost all contradiction alone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is lush and synesthetic, giving a singular perceptual signature; the cashier-narrator’s ritualistic return and tender caretaking feel internally coherent. Yet no meaningful change or renunciation is dramatized—we end where we began, only mood-shifted—so the arc is static. The ghost’s motivations are eloquently voiced but not tested by a visible choice that costs him. Still, the prose constantly embodies emotion (smells, colors, bones) and avoids diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” contradiction stays alive in every beat—she doubts the pill yet keeps signaling, letting the wand falter and restart. The narrator’s geode-cradling and breath-counting give tactile micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: memory > certainty. Both characters move from static burn to “forehead pressed” renunciation, paying the cost of reopened grief. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lone cartographer’s interiority is sensor-rich and consistent—micro-choices (wedging into the throat tunnel, trading the leaf for residency) enact the vow “speak carefully.” Flaw: no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; the cave’s welcome feels fated rather than fought-for, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hourglass-turner’s contradictory impulses—obedience to elders vs. theft of the jar—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (tilting the jar, pinning buttons). Interiority stays concrete: “sand lingers at the narrows like a held breath.” The final oath-shift from counting to offering is earned by the prior cataloging labor and carries visible communal cost—people physically reclaim their dead’s voices. No diagnostic label-speak; the character’s perceptual signature is consistent and individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ansel’s scarred interiority is rendered through embodied ticks—boot-cane-fingertip alphabet, pillbox weight as stabilizer—while the brass ring micro-choice forces a public/private self-merge. His “unused courage” want is pressure-tested when he drops the microfilm (visible cost) and accepts the steadier-burn exile; contradiction between spy reflex and need for witness is held in-scene. Len functions as pressure-plate rather than full secondary, but the wrist-press beat crystallizes loyalty/error history without exposition. The earned stasis—ring on scarred finger, no fireworks—pays off the burned-face map introduced in line 3; no diagnostic label-speak, only knife-edge statistics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s quiet, needle-threaded patience is embodied in every beat; his decision to trust river-murmur over command drives the crossing. Wren’s entrance adds status pressure, but the relationship shift stays low-stakes. Interior contradiction—hill-borne sorrow vs. water-road acceptance—surfaces in the oar rhythm, earning the final quiet renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is sensorially rich (“kiln walls warming a little, without flame”), but the potter’s contradictory impulses stay mostly lyrical rather than sharp under pressure; the final “steady tenderness” reads as poetic resolve more than a renunciation with visible cost, so the arc feels gently earned rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to “reflect light”—collide in the embodied tremor of picking the lock; the brass tooth is handled, not talked about. Micro-choices (kneeling on cold stone, sheltering the match like a fledgling) reveal a hierarchy of values where tending life outweighs safety. The final renunciation—staying to keep the beam turning—pays the concrete cost of perpetual exposure to wind and memory, foreclosing escape. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “forgiveness” is filtered through the image of broken windows becoming eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lone librarian’s interiority is rich—contradictory impulses (cataloguing vs. sheltering) collide in embodied beats (“I angle its atomically reflective face”). The micro-choice to sing the herd-song re-tunes the stone circle, earning the shelves’ leveling and the baskets’ relief; the cost is the hoarseness of that memory and the continued drift of the library itself. No second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets waived. Motivation stays steady: translate isolation into a door “held kindly,” a credo tested rather than declared. Closure is a credible endurance: the word “shelter” is written, the table set, the stance crystallized with visible fatigue. Missing the 9-band only because the beat-to-beat agency is more accumulative than causally irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is vivid—keeper of secrets posture is embodied in “walking in prismatic quiet”—but the lovers’ motivations are inferred rather than dramatized; the narrator’s decisive micro-choice (tucking letters beneath the bowl) is clear and carries cost, yet the lovers’ final step feels gently orchestrated rather than earned through visible contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s skeptical, chart-wielding technician persona is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (grounding himself with mittens, tightening the phase until hiss) grows from the established arc of cautious hope versus empirical duty. Interior contradictions play live in scene—flattery from the signal tempts, fear and laughter coexist—culminating in the earned renunciation of the committee chair. No stock phrasing, no diagnostic self-talk; the voice stays individual and flawed. The only hairline slip is the offstage “dean calls again” beat, slightly thinning final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Contradictory impulses (claustrophobia vs compulsion to move) are alive in every beat; the compass-point micro-choices tether identity to action. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Final endurance of tightness with key in hand is earned cost, visible on the page. Slight undercut: no secondary character on stage, so status/relationship crucible absent, but single-POV default holds.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s prosopagnosia is more than label: it dictates the entire investigative method—tracing posture, objects, weather instead of faces—so every choice is character-rooted. The final act of sending the painting is a credible renunciation that costs him the physical evidence and exposes his limits to the families, fulfilling earned stasis. Interior contradiction is present—wanting to name yet unable—kept alive through sensory anchoring (ribbon kink, perfume ghost). Micro-choices (pocket nothing, paint absence) reveal hierarchy of values without exposition; no competence fantasy, no tidy emotional algebra.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid, librarian traits shape every perception, but the “honor ancestor” motive stays static—no contradictory impulse on-page. Micro-choices (sliding the copper nail, marching to the deck) are embodied and specific; the final stance is credible yet cost is more conceptual than felt, capping 9- eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. compulsion to play—surface in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, lifting the shard, bow finding bridge). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the fiddle case on hood, cold glass in pocket, and arm warmth all externalize hierarchy of values. Bridge-song vocation is not decorative but causal: it triggers the ledger’s re-write and physically draws the hitchhiker back into grain. Cost is felt: the new duet at the end forecloses solitary grief, completing a believable endurance-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The highway-robber’s son remains a consistent sensibility—maps, exits, inherited evasion—but the interiority is more atmospheric than embodied; no micro-choice under pressure exposes a contradictory impulse. The polished calm is repeatedly asserted yet never tested in a beat where it could fail or cost him, so the arc stays flat. Closure image (“the hunted and the hunter trade names”) is evocative, but the absence of a visible behavioral cost keeps the change conceptual, not earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lucid-dream chronicler narrator’s motive—decoding temple glyphs through variable-star grammar—remains concrete and intensifies when Mara arrives; the micro-choice to read star-light aloud together crystallizes his “heals with words” trait under pressure. Interiority is atmospheric but sometimes drifts toward poetic self-labeling (“I witness best when…”). The closing yes to keep witnessing costs him future solitude, a credible renunciation at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The druid’s guarded calm is vividly embodied in micro-choices—crouching, spine rising like a mast, treaty whispered to the seed—showing internal contradiction between warlike serenity and unmilitant unbending. Motivation stays anchored in recovering truth for self, not town, supplying credible moral ambiguity. Interiority is specific, never therapeutic; cost is visible when he pockets the coin as receipt, foreclosing trophy-taking. Flaws (professional detachment) complicate the final moment of listening, earning the shift without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The root-bound visionary shows embodied contradiction—literally grafted, figuratively bound to futures not yet tallied—and the final refusal to restore the covenant is earned through the scar-linking sequence. Interiority is concrete (“questions in my ribs”), yet the emotional layering flirts with lyric abstraction just past the 8+ threshold. Micro-choices (tucking clipping, pressing wrist to bark) visibly tilt tactics. Cost is felt when gardeners’ shears lower and sundial “agreed to tell time again, sometimes,” sealing Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s “reckless idealist” motive is embodied in the tactile gesture of giving away her own name and planting the listening seeds; the micro-choice carries visible cost and alters both her stance and the boy’s fate, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete—ash map, bone-hand, card-warmth—without therapeutic self-labeling. One slight dip: the boy’s shift from cindery eyes to “rain on coal” is more observed than lived, so the symmetrical exchange feels fractionally neat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s insulating tactic is shown in embodied beats—measuring the scrap, pricing it separately—and the final micro-choice to list the cloth as “memory load” is earned. Interior contradiction is live: wanting numbness yet fingering the singed corner. The scrap’s re-weighting is credible because the hand remembers before the mind consents. Only minor slip: “confidently uncertain” is named, not dramatized in a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The translator’s methodical kindness is embodied in every tactile micro-choice—fingers trusting grooves, voice cupping rails—until the final quiet renunciation of “not to own transition, but to keep company.” Interior contradiction hums in the haunted ambition that never settled, yet never collapses into therapeutic self-talk. The seed-split moment reweights his hierarchy of values on the page, paying the cost of letting her stay gone. No stock phrasing, no label-speak; even the grief is filtered through reed-and-water physics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian’s hinge-hearted patience and cataloguing obsession are vivid, but the only micro-choice—accepting the woman’s triple cards—feels performed rather than pressured; no interior contradiction is dramatized under the moon-phase stakes, so the “keep” vow at the end, while resonant, is not visibly paid for by prior causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inspector’s interior contradiction—trained to seal bunkers, now seeking communion—is dramatized in the heartbeat of hesitation where the pearl is crowned; that micro-choice carries palpable cost as the badge’s authority is silently renounced. Emotion is embodied (eyes sting, palm brightens inward) rather than labeled. The shift from auditor to conduit is fully earned, not asserted, and the flaw of mistaking safety for solitude is confronted without therapeutic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven self-punishment versus the methodical drive to map and forgive—are alive in every micro-choice. The accordion bellows acts as a second lung, forcing embodied emotion into the scene; the decision to lie down on the sluice gate and sync breath with the patched instrument is a visible cost that forecloses denial. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic speak; instead, the river’s literal weight replaces abstract guilt. The final renunciation—writing that the river will no longer be asked to mirror him—earns its stasis through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vivid—breath-syncing with the watch, copying spirals by pulse—but remains curiously frictionless: no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes the quest. The “confidence man’s lie” and “truth I would need” promise a flaw that never complicates action; the protagonist glides from threshold to corridor without error or sacrifice. Because the ending’s cost is purely atmospheric (a library that “travels with me in intervals”), the arc feels completed yet unearned. Still, the embodied micro-choices—turning screws degree by degree, breathing fog onto the page—keep characterization above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s interiority is lush, plant-tuned, and action-anchored; the frost-woman promise and paycheck-vs-dream contradiction are felt in every micro-choice. The final renunciation (play→melt→walk away) is earned and costly, though the “mulberry ache” is named more than embodied. Still, the telepathy trait actively shapes perception beats, not just décor, keeping motivation organic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The beautician-mortician’s contradictory drives—scientific care vs. mystic hope—are alive in every micro-gesture (calming cold skin while planting a “whisper-engine”). Her mentor’s remembered voice and the emerald transfer create a visible cost: she forfeits pure guild orthodoxy, ending “unshaken and remade.” Interiority stays concrete, never drifts to label-speak. Competence balanced with credulity feels lived-in, not schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker’s interiority is concrete—her micro-choices (pruning, scalloping the map, planting the scraps) enact the forgiveness stakes. Contradictory impulses (flee/return, keep/let-go) braid through embodied action; renunciation of the hairpin carries legible cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lark’s “sincerely insincere” mask is shown, not labeled, in her choice to fund boats with the tax she vowed to cut; the narrator’s micro-choice to accept the hollow shard as fee embodies his mercenary detachment. Interior contradiction pulses throughout (“rented doubt and rented faith”), but the narrator’s moral arithmetic stays external—never quite pierced under pressure—so the final stance feels observed rather than sweat-through. Still, the visible cost (public confession, political suicide) is legible and scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“patience tasted of lake smoke and copper”—but the researcher remains a cipher whose reverse-aging never complicates choices on the page; the final vanishing is accepted too smoothly, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skimmer’s interiority is lyrically particular—tuning breath to birds, counting beats that “refuse me and allow”—and the renunciation of motion is a credible, costly stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only described, so the arc is slightly static; the final “map inside me” is earned but not viscerally paid for in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—hunger for magic while flunking glamour exams—are dramatized in the mist-walk stumble. Micro-choices (inserting the keystone, refusing to own it) visibly foreclose paths with felt cost: permanent outsider status and perpetual apprenticeship. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into diagnostic labels. The only drag is the off-stage city automatization, so the social stakes are asserted more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lamplighter’s interiority is concrete—his practiced ease of slipping into water, the brass tag against his throat—but the “hides behind truth” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; no moment shows him dodging honesty at cost. The vow he leaves is binding yet feels more lyrical than earned, a quiet pledge without an on-page trade-off that would foreclose a path. Micro-choices (brushing a book, mouthing the vow) are present but low-stakes; the hum’s color change happens to him rather than through a decision that costs him something visible. Still, his perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, keeping him above the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied (“I laughed once, startled that certainty should be asked of a randomizer”). The final surrender of the ‘cast lots’ identity is earned by a chain of micro-choices with visible cost (“the old shame of my title fall away”). Minor slip: Sori’s emotional interior is ventriloquised once (“quietly enthusiastic” becomes label-speak in the receiver-tending beat), keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The reaper’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual (taping vellum to the lens, lifting the scythe as “cold line for focus”), and the interior contradiction—needing to name fears yet knowing names are only “agreements”—is kept alive to the last line. micro-choices (naming Shoreless, drawing tomorrow’s harbor) visibly cost him: each new name extends his exile-catalogue of sorrow. The absence of Miren on stage keeps relationship-as-crucible from activating, and the one-note occupation (eternal reaper) limits status dynamics, capping the score just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Efan’s earnest naivete is embodied in every micro-choice—chalking tides on his sleeve, tying kelp to the fracture—so “lukewarm” reads as a disciplined refusal of grandstanding rather than passive description. His internal contradiction steady vs brittle devotion is visible when he cradles the bell “with uncertain hands,” a gesture that costs him the heroic pose the city gave him. The moment of closure—the bell humming coordination instead of ringing—earns its poise because we have watched his mathematics cautiously accumulate, not because he claims certainty. Secondary pressure is minimal (the fisherman serves mainly as witness), so relationship dynamics can’t lift the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The warden’s “precisely humane” creed is dramatized in every micro-choice—pocketing the label, naming stones, radioing volunteers—so the final refusal to expunge feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: the ache he “cannot place,” breath steadying with the mirrored hush. No stock gestures; even his mentor’s maxim arrives via condensation-traced letters, not lecture. Cost is palpable: he will still file reports, but the living story carried in mouths shows the path foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iri’s interior contradiction—ledger vs. lullaby—is dramatized in every beat (handling the crystal, refusing her formulas, ribbon tied to branch). The final renunciation of reciting formulas is earned by the orchard’s sensory feedback and starling stillness, so the cost feels lived. Micro-choices (kneeling to flame, sliding reliquary under roots) reveal value hierarchy with visible stakes. Slight softness: “secretly sentimental” is declared twice rather than revealed solely through action; ribbon beat helps but still leans label.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The watcher's interior contradiction—trust in his own vigilance versus the memory of a past failure—drives every micro-choice; the final nod with the pilot crystallizes a cost that has been embodied, not declared. Competence is balanced by the scar under the friendship, keeping flaw active. No label-speak; emotion is muscle and weather. The earned stasis lands because the earlier rupture was dramatized, not recalled in abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“frost after the void,” “taste of river stones”—but the narrator’s decisive shift to joint custody is asserted rather than dramatized in a micro-choice; the emotional thaw is felt yet not visibly paid for in a single beat. Neri and Rae remain mirrors, not fully individuated voices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her laughter soft to avoid waking the seed, her hand cupping darkness—yet the “puzzle grew in her” beat drifts toward abstraction. The contradictions (profit vs. stewardship, spectacle vs. quiet) live in her micro-choices (pot from prop shelf, timer set to bracket). Closure cost is felt: she bows, literally curating wonder, foreclosing a louder-money path. Still, her flaws stay slightly safe; no misbelief visibly derails her.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.3)
    The conductor’s mournful eagerness is stated repeatedly yet never enacted through contradictory micro-choices; he pulls cords, mouths names, but we get no interior clash that forces a costly decision. The promised “profession of tending the unspoken” remains an abstract label—no beat shows him weighing, say, the risk of waking grief versus the need for laughter. The ending’s “repaired silence” is handed to him by the tunnel rather than earned through a visible renunciation or mistake, so the arc feels ascribed, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s “dimensionally homesick” ache is lived-in from line 1; every beat of fold-and-carry interiority grows from that flaw and forecloses the old idea of home. The guardian’s wolf-taught tenderness is shown through gesture (pendant weighing, circle-draw) rather than label, so both characters feel singular. The final renunciation—carrying the garden instead of occupying it—pays the cost of permanent exile in a single, embodied image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—“hands do not tremble / heart hears everything”—is sustained in embodied action (palm pressed to grate, hair packed inside crozier). Micro-choices (salt pinch, slower bellows, final snap) trace a credible arc from obedience to self-immolation. Cost is felt: skin to heat, ash in lungs, bishop’s authority reduced to embered question mark. Missing second character keeps relationship crucible dormant, capping at 8.6.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is dense and idiosyncratic—"fantasy practicality," "testing wonders with calipers"—but the narrator’s contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized under pressure; the final climb-and-release is more lyrical tableau than legible choice, so the renunciation feels emblematic rather than personally costly. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The deckhand’s contradictory impulses—clinging to routine while courting the radio’s impossible promise—play out in embodied beats (tracing star-dust with a broom, flipping the hourglass “across” time). The final choice to keep the tide’s undertow costs him the certainty of arrival, a renunciation earned by every prior sweep of the benches. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. One hairline slip: the captain’s single snort is too slight to register as full status pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fever dream architect’s quiet authority and tactile thread-work embody his motives; interiority surfaces through sensory micro-choices (“measured a room without stable edges”). The curator’s skepticism and eventual physical participation show a credible shift. The visitor’s momentary triangle of attention supplies external pressure, but lacks lingering consequence, keeping the arc just short of a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator-instructor’s contradictory yearning—teaching students to “navigate by starlight they cannot see” while clinging to a rusted anchor link—gives a credible, embodied flaw. Micro-choices (night crawls to map erased edges, the chain thudding against his thigh) keep interiority concrete. The final bow with open palms crystallizes Earned Stasis: he accepts the cost of lifelong exile from the surface sky. No secondary character presses him, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tracer’s embodied interiority—“listening becomes a structure I can walk through”—is vivid and consistent; the micro-choice to walk the city against orders crystallizes his curiosity under pressure. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. compulsion) coexist in-scene, not in summary. Cost is legible: he forfeits institutional safety and absorbs others’ grief without shield. Voice remains singular; no stock therapeutic labels mar the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is sensorily rich and claustrophobic; the compulsion to “track invisible things” drives every beat. The decision to leave the gold fleck behind crystallizes a credible shift from theft to stewardship, paying off the flaw. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single moment, keeping this just outside the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven return vs. fear of the digital ghost—are dramatized in every micro-choice (warming the radio, scraping frost, aligning the dish). The porcelain shard as both wound and lens externalizes the flaw that once blinded the array; its final pocketing is a credible renunciation that costs the comfort of forgetting. Interiority is sensorial (“taste of iron,” “staccato I cannot slow”) rather than diagnostic. The heartbeat counting is not a quirk but a pacing device that collides with agency when speech must interrupt it to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s quiet articulation and texture-to-sound mission stay consistent; every micro-choice (climbing ridge, feeding listeners his breath, surrendering his travel-name) grows from the same interior contradiction between fear of the curse and duty to the dying language. Embodied emotion is vivid—palms warming to the diamond, thirst like dry ink—yet the arc is a credible endurance/renunciation rather than a sharp change, so the “earned stasis” lands but feels slightly foreknown. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; voice remains singular.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Interiority is sensory-rich ("ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose"), but the narrator’s covert motive never visibly collides with on-page risk; choices are passive listening and cleaning until the final unforced acceptance. The single micro-choice—planting the arrowhead—arrives late and wins instant assent, so the cost feels abstract rather than wrested from prior contradiction. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The violinist’s longing is embodied in tactile micro-choices—bow pressure, locust mute, heart-tapped code—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction is palpable: desire to awaken beauty vs terror of stone judgment. The final stance crystallizes when he stops bowing and lets heartbeat finish the sentence; cost is the risk of remaining in the open. Flaw: no secondary character to test status shift; solo POV keeps it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and voice-specific (“maps hold their breath,” “boots prudent, heart ungoverned”). The mailman’s contradictory drives—regulation vs. rebellion—are embodied in micro-choices (staying at Mina’s, rerouting the sunflower letter). Cost is visible: the extra hour spent costs him risk at the checkpoint and emotional exposure. The only drag: “respectfully rebellious” is repeated as label twice; a small slip at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The carpenter’s quiet, listening stance is vividly embodied; every sanding stroke and breath-timed rotation grows from his “unspoken questions.” Internal contradiction is subtle but present—his silence versus the moment he must sing—yet the cost of that surrender (his voice, his anonymity) is felt in the final breath the carousel takes. No stock phrases; even “quietly persistent” is worn like a tool in his belt rather than a badge. The only thing keeping this from 9+ is that the halo fragment, not his flaw, supplies the final click; the horse crown feels like grace rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    The librarian’s quiet obsession with curvature-shelving gives her a singular, credible quirk, but she never makes a choice that risks anything; the “return with news” is observational, not consequential. Interiority is rich—ozone scarf, negative-curvature aisles—but remains static; no contradictory impulse forces a visible cost. The boy and the woman register only as appreciative mirrors, so status/relationship pressure is absent. The final line admits failure (“have not found”), producing Charged Poise, yet the stance is unchanged from line one, so renunciation feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian’s contradiction—custodian of knowledge yet pursuer of an elusive dream—surfaces in concrete micro-choices (setting out plates, refusing to turn). Emotion is embodied through salt-stung fingers and dawn-drenched palettes; no diagnostic self-talk. The final renunciation costs him the dream’s physical presence yet earns a re-cataloged dawn; the price is legible. Interiority stays anchored to sensory action, though occasional lyric lift drifts toward emblem rather than beat-specific pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s timidity-to-song arc is embodied in micro-choices—handing over the hair, singing the wavering note—each carrying visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“the tug of combs…cursing softly”) rather than diagnostic. The locksmith stays enigmatic yet purposeful, his minimal dialogue and ritual bowing revealing status and intent. The final renunciation of fear is earned through these staged, embodied beats, foreclosing the “no” path with felt vocal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The folklorist’s curiosity is embodied through tactile gear and micro-choices (chalking cracks, biting the apple) that cost air and guilt; the admission “I loved the work more than the woman” crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible price. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The earned partial return of grandmother’s cadence shows credible endurance rather than tidy healing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s interiority is gorgeously textured—embodied in “I walk backwards when nervous” and the tactile handling of porcelain—but the absence of a second on-page character keeps the relationship crucible dormant, capping depth. Micro-choices (pouring, pacing, corking) do trace a credible hierarchy of values, yet the final stance crystallizes without a visible new cost beyond what the library already risks.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.3)
    Miren’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. intervention, solitude vs. communal gift—are alive in every micro-cut she makes; the “seed’s hunger for testimony” externalizes her interior conflict without slipping into label-speak. Her embodied emotion (“breathed on it, the glow shivered”) and tactile ritual (pruning, moss, locket) keep knowledge strictly character-bound. The final renunciation—planting the seed in a mere seam—carries visible cost: she surrenders control of the heirloom to the valley’s collective dawn-watch, earning Earned Stasis. Interiority never drifts into therapy-speak; even the child’s arrival tests her hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The restorer’s solitary labor is credibly embodied—every motion of needle and palm carries the weight of salt-death. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tug between sealing ghosts away and letting them breathe, shown when the narrator “taught [joy] how to rest” beside grief. The final act of lifting the rewoven mask to the face crystallizes a renunciation: no exorcism, only stewardship, paid for with cut fingers and prismatic scars. One hairline slip: the caretaker’s winter-grip catch is briefly observed from outside the POV, a microscopic leakage that keeps this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s “shielded openness” and “methodically curious” traits are embodied in every micro-choice: listening before pinning, refusing to open the vault alone, deciding to frame the tear as a seam. Interiority is concrete (“felt cold air nick my fingertips”), contradictions held in scene rather than summarized. The final renunciation—leaving the saved hush in place—pays off the established flaw/virtue of cautious empathy with visible cost (the map wound stays exposed). No status dynamics or second-character pressure on stage, so relationship bullets correctly ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s calm, analytic patience under lethal pressure is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (filming the globe, copying Morse, pocketing the artifact) externalizes the internalized “physics of letting go.” The contradiction between forensic detachment and tender caretaking gives the voice its charge. No stock phrasing; even the snow-globe crack is felt as a capillary of ruin. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “surrender of reference frames,” which leans label-speak, but it is offset by the immediate cost of leaving the ship behind.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    The balladeer’s interior contradiction—thirst to sing vs. acceptance of quiet—is embodied in micro-choices (tightening bolts, tracing chalk). Flaw: the renunciation at closure is more asserted than paid for; we feel uplift but no forfeiture. Still, the steady “driftingly alert” stance under pressure keeps motive legible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The servant’s gentle, curiosity-driven motive is credibly particularized through tactile micro-choices (humming to bolts, angling goggles), and the final renunciation—leaving the diary open—pays off an interior contradiction between assignment and compassion. Emotional embodiment is mostly vivid (“breath borrowed from cold saints”), yet a few abstractions (“joy beneath anguish”) slightly dilute full irrational complexity. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets skipped; internal arc cleanly tied to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is textured through embodied, character-specific perception ("engine-oil / cinnamon" corridor; brass telescope as father's ghost). The avowed goal—to prove emptiness remembers—does motivate every micro-choice (cloud taxonomy, radio silence naming). Yet the decisive swing toward home relies on external rescue more than internal contradiction; the cost is felt but not paid by a final, irreversible choice on the page. The promise of memorializing is beautifully voiced, but its fulfillment is deferred to log pages we never see, capping the arc just short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s face-blindness is more than label: it dictates the “edges and weights” method used to read the coin and paint the sky, linking perception to action. Interiority stays concrete—charcoal on skin, glaze choosing its path—rather than abstract. The final renunciation (signing with the coin, accepting the mural may outlast him) carries visible cost in the tightening stillness and the dust settling on wet paint. Micro-choices—testing blue until it fractures, matching coin arcs to rings—reveal a hierarchy of values (art over escape) under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The apprentice’s curiosity is concrete—sleeping under charts, compass dust—but the decisive chalk-reading choice is lightly motivated; we’re told of docks-hopscotch memory rather than shown how that past forces this night-risk. Interiority is atmospheric, not contradictory; no visible flaw-cost beyond “pretended not to glow,” which is performative rather than embodied price. Earned Stasis qualifies but the cost is poetic, not tangible. Still, voice-specific attention (compass dust, kettle-lid note) keeps the character individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The locksmith’s interior contradiction—driftwood nostalgia vs. the need to mend time—stays embodied (cedar breath trembles the clocks). Micro-choices (filing the notch, leaving the crescent key) trace a credible renunciation that costs him permanence. Yet the “repair” motive is declared more than dramatized until late; earlier beats lean on atmospheric gesture. The final nod to younger selves crystallizes growth, but the emotional ledger could carry sharper loss.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The collective “we” is credibly individuated through embodied labor, thirst, and grief; micro-choices (climbing, knotting, counting breaths) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction is absent—no one dissents once the bell rings—but the shared flaw (cling to old grievances) is acted out in the mid-stream apology trading, so the renunciation of isolation is earned. Relationships function as crucible: the stranded families force the orchard to become one body, altering status from stranger to kin. Cost is visible in raw hands and the long dissolve of the final bell-rain inside ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific (“bruised awe lived under my ribs”), but the narrator’s agency is largely observational; the filing of one gear is the sole micro-choice that alters the present. The puppet head provides externalized conscience yet never forces a visible trade-off; the final song is tender but not predicated on any prior mistake or flaw. Earned stasis is present—the keeper accepts endless vigil—yet the cost feels abstract rather than bodily or social.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s guilt-rooted duty is palpable in every micro-choice—avoiding ground-touch, breathing in sync, coaxing doorways—yet the interior contradiction between wanting to flee and being bound is only asserted, not enacted in scene. The boy’s nut gesture gives the caretaker a surrogate chance to plant escape, tightening the thorn-halo motif, but the woman remains a prop rather than a crucible. Still, the embodied salt-spray exhaustion and the final, self-sentencing return supply enough earned cost to lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The interior contradiction—guilt over the shredded packaging vs. the childhood “listening”—is vivid and embodied; the chrysalis test in palm gives a micro-choice that crystallizes the new polymer rule. The final renunciation (returning to the city with damp boots and Braiding) carries visible cost and is earned by the river cadence work. Mentor/sister rift is told more than staged, so relationship-as-crucible is weak, but single-POV pressure suffices. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws complicate the closure choice rather than being smoothed away.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vendor’s desire “to find the place where stories begin” anchors motive, but interiority drifts into lyric cipher (“ledger of returned regrets”) rather than conflicting impulse. No contradictory desire is staged in scene; the micro-choice to pour moonlight is poetic but not dramatized as fraught. The ending’s acceptance of the comma-seed registers as quiet image, not visible cost to the self.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The chef’s memory-tasting gift is never explained, yet every micro-choice (scraping the coral, blistering peppers, tasting broth) is grounded in sensory risk that visibly costs him jaw-ache, rust-blood mouth, and final steady breathing. The keeper’s single remembered gate-left-unbarred is compressed into one filament-touch—enough to earn the later quiet stand-taller. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak, and the final jar-saving is a believable occupational reflex rather than savior framing. Only the brother-under-hooves image drifts toward shorthand violence instead of embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “empathetically decisive” trait is dramatized in every beat—her door-to-door listening tour, the rope-and-weight counterweight scheme, her downbeat that launches the canon—so the label is earned, not worn. Interior contradiction is light (she never doubts aloud), yet her body-in-action (palms singing with rope, arms raised for downbeat) keeps emotion embodied. The cuckoo-clock-weight-as-pendulum choice crystallizes her value hierarchy: time-keeping < bridge-building, a micro-choice that scales to communal cost. Closure is a credible renunciation of isolation, paid for by shared labor and the permanent re-purposing of the weight—Earned Stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The helix-minded engineer’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. chaos—are dramatized in every micro-choice (mirror tilts, circuit edits). Interiority stays concrete: “chest tightened with the calm panic of recognition.” The final renunciation—tucking the shards and walking on—pays the cost of accepting impermanence, earned by the prior pulses that literally fractured the tool and the self.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archivist’s interiority is vivid—refusing “glitter,” “starving the familiar”—but the arc is more pilgrimage than struggle; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the promised flaw-to-cost link is asserted rather than lived. The iron crown’s warmth is the only embodied price, and it arrives as blessing, not loss.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sculptor’s quiet renunciation of “cleverness” for a steady pulse is earned; the porcelain-insulator micro-choices visibly cost him the chance at a louder art. Interiority stays concrete—“porcelain skin against the old fractures”—never drifting into label-speak. Flaw is single-note: we never feel him doubt or misstep, so the arc is smooth rather than serrated. Still, the endurance lands as individual, not type, and the withheld-applause image gives a sharp, character-specific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tutor’s exile-guilt and pedagogic drive are credibly knotted; the choice to surrender the basalt king carries a felt cost. Interiority is concrete (“chess is the art of what goes unsaid”), but the emotional crescendo leans on lyrical paraphrase rather than a final contradictory impulse in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s pacifist repairer identity is embodied in the refusal to pry and the delicate acoustic unlocking of the clasp; the inherited mission to “catalog silence” gives every micro-choice a cost. Interiority stays concrete—sound is touch, belief works when heard—without therapeutic gloss. The final signing with both names shows a credible, scaled-to-length change: acceptance of the archive’s burden. The single weakness is that the grandmother remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is implied rather than enacted, capping the score at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is gorgeously embodied (“smell stitched the canopy”) and motives tighten with each beat; the final acceptance of stewardship is earned by the corpse-flower ritual. Ambition is held in contradictory tension—restlessness vs. serenity—visible in micro-choices (soaking roots in jasmine-ash tea, inhaling until eyes water). One slip: elders/villagers drift from distinct faces to choral backdrop, so status pressure is felt but not individualized. Closure carries visible cost: the narrator’s vow “softened,” foreclosing prior ambition while still tending the foul bloom—an Earned Stasis that pays its bill on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the pilot’s perceptions of sap-glow and echo-grammar feel idiosyncratic. Contradictory impulses—awe versus duty, fear of inversion versus hunger to know—co-exist in-scene. The arrow-tip micro-choices (drawing, touching, binding) trace a credible value hierarchy. Only the grandmother’s backstory edges toward label-speak (“she swore it sang”), but the metal’s later hum re-anchors it in present sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The investigator’s calm, procedural interiority stays consistent; every chalk mark and tape ribbon is a micro-choice that externalizes his mentor-trained posture. The moment he hangs the patch on the antenna and watches it hesitate—then pockets it—crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only stated in reflection, keeping him just shy of the top band. Relationship crucible is absent, but the child’s brief presence still acts as a mirror that sharpens his stoic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell ringer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—synesthetic perceptions braid with the aurora to guide every micro-choice. The sculptor remains a functional silhouette, but the POV’s contradictory drive (“work and prayer”) sustains tension. The final renunciation—leaving the hush unfettered—pays the cost of never monetizing wonder; the prior causality of the amber sheet’s “trapped sunlight” earns this. One-POV default met; head-count waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s guilt and need for atonement are palpable through embodied detail and micro-choices (unrolling trembling maps, re-casing the flute). Internal contradiction is alive: pride in craft vs. recognition of catastrophic shortcut. The decisive shift—playing the third note with loosened weave—pays the cost of public emptiness and private shame. Yet the “driven relic keeper” label is asserted more than dramatized; we see the failure’s aftermath more than the original breach choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—using ambiguity as shield yet needing to edit grief—is embodied in micro-choices (borrowing Maris, selecting Caslon, leaving the fragment). The final renunciation of borrowed courage costs the safety of ventriloquism; the earned stasis lands. Maris-ghost stays slightly abstract, but the halo fragment’s warmth/cool cycles give the flaw tactile consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The courier’s tremulous interiority is embodied in every breath and palm-tremble; the pendant’s tremor literalizes his sympathetic vibration, making motivation legible. The widow’s single gesture—breathing into his hands—crystallizes a status shift and shared stakes. Cost is felt when the corridor thins and the mentor’s absence is re-felt. The only bar to 9-band is that the “jittery” trait never complicates the success of the ritual—he is competent under pressure without visible flaw-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mystic’s interiority is rich—"attention is a candle in windy places"—and his contradictory need to prove the unprovable while sheltering his own doubt is embodied throughout. Mara’s arc from sneering scientist to trembling believer is credible because her body gives her away before her mind surrenders. The micro-choice to press her palm to the frost-handprint crystallizes the relationship shift with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "truthful lies" is used diagnostically twice in one beat, a hairline intrusion of label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kio’s interiority is lyrically specific—her need for a border against unraveling, her willingness to thin herself fiber by fiber—yet the brother remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only implied. The final smile and emptied loom show credible renunciation, but the cost is more poetic than viscerally felt. Still, her contradictory impulses (cling vs. send) are woven into every loom pass, satisfying the 9+ test almost fully.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iven’s quiet resolve is embodied in action (hammering hope, mapping chalk, offering memories) rather than labels. The wrist bruise from the tightening silk gives visible cost to his endurance, earning his final smile. Interiority stays sparse but consistent with a meek man who speaks to stone; the single POV keeps pressure coherent. His refusal of fame (“only for work, and for sleep”) crystallizes Earned Stasis without speechifying.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sensory-map-maker persona is lived-in: every beat filters through scent, pressure, haptic memory. Interior contradiction—child-as-saboteur versus adult-as-cartographer—plays out in the micro-choice to re-witness, not erase, the log. Embodied cost arrives when the shard warms against palm accepting irreversible weight. Flaw: the mother’s silence is told more than dramatized, but the protagonist’s self-reintegration is earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s wry self-definition—“I am just the last person who said yes”—gives immediate, particular interiority that persists. His micro-choices (lighting the candle, pressing sea-glass to palm, stacking stones) embody the need to “bottle safety,” yet the arc is endurance rather than change; the cost feels diffuse because the prior keeper’s drowning is told, not dramatized. Reticent skipper functions as silent pressure source, but his choices are observed, not enacted, so relationship crucible stays latent. Emotional stakes stay credible and flawed, but the absence of a decisive pivot or visible forfeiture keeps the arc just shy of high-band impact.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s motive—“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is vivid, but interiority is more atmospheric than contradictory; the child’s arrival shifts caretaking into action, yet her agency is off-stage. The “storm herald” persona stays lyrical rather than pressure-tested; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs the narrator custody or identity. Earned stasis is implied—keep transmitting—but the emotional price is gestured, not embodied. Voice is singular, but secondary pressure from the child is under-choreographed.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dye-master’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the donor heart’s foreign memory—drives every micro-choice (tilting the wing, shifting tables). Emotions stay embodied: the heart “leans,” the room “holds its breath.” The final renunciation—listening without stealing—grows directly from the wing’s earlier lesson, paying a felt cost: he will keep standing “where colors are almost colors,” forever partial. No stock labels; the voice’s perceptual signature (“broken sapphires,” “quietly explosive beacon”) is inseparable from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—“labyrinth sighed like a sleeping boiler,” “measured grief will float”—but the protagonist’s emotional engine stays reactive; no forked choice ever jeopardizes his safety or belief. The micro-choice to press the cracked sextant against the root is the solitary visible wager; it suffices for this length but keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “memory keeper” is vividly interiorized—her warped self-image (“my own seams never fully held”), her tactile rituals (swaddling grafts with spider-silk), and her growing integration (“my scattered selves gather like swallows”) track a credible arc. Flaws complicate action: she doubts, over-reaches, and finally shares scars. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the endurance-poise at the end carries visible cost and is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Protagonist’s reclusive empathy drives every beat; the “staying while leaving” paradox is lived in body and choice, culminating in the handshake that refuses old shapes. Contradictory impulses—flight vs. need to mend—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. Interiority stays concrete (“I mistook proximity for medicine”) and the final renunciation costs him the shelter of anonymity. Micro-choices (notebook sold, knees that stay) track visible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is embodied through tactile micro-choices—pruning, crumbing, pouring tea—each a quiet refusal to forget. Interior contradiction surfaces when self-reproach for “normalizing the wound” collides with the need to keep witnessing. The final shared gesture with the cashier crystallizes a hierarchy of values: remembrance over absolution, practice over piety, with the cost of perpetual vigilance legible in the line “a line thrown from shore that I will have to keep holding.” Only the cashier’s late entrance keeps the relationship crucible from full pressure until the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s “gently meticulous” nature is shown through tactile micro-choices (steadying lantern with mittened hands, slowing breath, lifting palms to lens) that visibly cost him body heat and solitude; the interior contradiction between clinging to order while surrendering to erasure is present in scene, but the final vow’s emotional price is more declared than dramatized—“I would catalog the erased months” tells the forfeiture rather than letting us feel the frostbite of that promise.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lark’s interiority is vivid—her father’s maps, the fob’s tick, her tactile thwart of the thief—but the “sound of trust breaking” remains an abstract want; we never feel her need collide with a concrete personal stake (she neither gains nor loses a relationship). The cutpurse hook, the toppled limes, and her final quiet are all embodied micro-choices, yet the emotional cost is displaced onto the market rather than internalized as irrevocable loss or self-redefinition. Still, her perceptual signature (river winds, tide tables, recorder gain) keeps her singular and the early/late fob reprise supplies a charged poise that almost earns stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skeptic’s interiority is vivid—taste-as-compass literalizes doubt under auroral pressure—yet the renunciation (“I will carry your story”) feels slightly foregone; no visible flaw compounds earlier choice. Still, contradictory impulses (doubt vs. longing) coil inside each micro-taste, and the final cost is felt as the ring’s flavor turns to “alone.”

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s “mnemonically gifted” trait is more than label: it enables the decisive act of drawing the lock whole and unlocks the box without force, a credible payoff. Interior contradiction is present—grief vs. survival economics—and the final micro-choice to sign Vera’s name beside his own shows earned, visible cost. Minor dilution: Vera is off-stage, so status/relationship crucible is absent, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gilded-leaf calligrapher's interiority is vivid—emotions are embodied in leaf-curl, mildew-taste, shoulder-sag. The "wilts near dishonesty" trait is dramatized twice (refusing to gild the lie; halting leaf-post) with visible cost: greenhouse dims, clientele murmurs truths. The final micro-choice—leading the city to the hatch—earns the earlier hunger for lost conversations. Voice remains coherent; no stock therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iri’s renunciation of speech and guarded silence are embodied in micro-choices—salting bells, smudging ledger, trembling fingers—showing interior contradiction and cost. Archive Keepers’ one-beat shift from grasp to bow dramatizes external pressure that alters their stance. The seasonal muteness trait is label-heavy until winter arrival; earlier dramatization would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The android caretaker’s contradictory impulses—obedience to system versus need for ritual containment—are dramatized in the mini-burn scene; the final archival annotation is earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (‘my chest plating’ ‘a rib of code unlatched’) without diagnostic jargon. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: recalibrate pumps vs risk system breach vs keep the child’s ember. Flaw compounds: its nostalgia circuits literally crackle, forcing the burn that softens the roses and itself. Earned Stasis lands: the dome still tilts, but the caretaker now carries both protocol and tenderness, a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The curator’s “inventory stories before objects” stance is dramatized through the choice to circulate the locket and orchestrate the listening circle; the renunciation of sole ownership of Noemi’s letters costs the narrator their authority and completes the arc. Interiority stays concrete (“I could feel the box hear us”) and avoids label-speak. The final act of leaving the mailbox unlocked crystallizes the curator’s shift from collector to conduit, paying the price of control for communal healing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s calm defiance and embodied code-dance are vividly particular; every pirouette tilts real options under water-pressure. The narrator’s fear-to-function arc is legible, but interior contradiction is asserted (“cataloging my fear”) rather than dramatized in body. One micro-choice—aligning our hesitation with the drowned engineers—carries cost, yet the final breath-laugh feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than paid for by prior struggle. Still, the duet of bodies and drowned machines keeps characterization above the merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern-lighter’s grief for his sister is embodied in every micro-choice—pressing flowers, breathing on glass, sealing the tin—so the interiority stays character-specific and contradictory. His competence (lighting, exhuming, navigating gravity pockets) is balanced by the genuine struggle of memory-loss and the risk of stepping into unstable space. The final renunciation—carrying the memory back to the tin rather than into his own head—pays the visible cost of never fully reclaiming her, earning an Earned Stasis that feels scaled to the story’s microcosm. Only the chemist’s voice converges toward the narrator’s lyric register, a minor voice-blend that keeps this just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The summoner’s interiority is gorgeously particular—"eyes bright with inward constellations," "lantern of calm opened and burned without smoke"—and every micro-choice (placing the wing, guiding breath, renouncing victory) is tethered to the core task. The arc of endurance/renunciation is credible, but the absence of any visible failure or contradiction keeps the struggle a touch too serene for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s curiosity about the building’s language is embodied in micro-listening choices; the tutor’s contradictory “dead language tutor” line crystallizes his function. Interiority stays concrete—“ivy strangling and embracing at once” fuses guilt/loyalty. The seal-handover in the meteor light is a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only minor slack: the narrator’s emotional saturation never quite cracks under final pressure, keeping the change one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s “charmed skeptic” persona is vividly embodied in micro-choices—pressing palm to stone, refusing worship but offering carriage—so contradiction pulses on the page. The interiority stays concrete (“winter in my chest, a precise cold that did not sting”) and the final stance is earned: the quarantined memory transferred, the garden silent, the self re-defined. Emotional progression layers credibly from wary listening through dizzy acceptance to the quiet archive. No head-count or relationship issues arise; the solo POV holds. Minor drag: “tragic radiance” is asserted more than dramatized, keeping this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific; the forger’s micro-choices (lowering the key, pressing the thorn into the fissure) visibly enact the renunciation of completion. The contradiction between “traitor” and “measurer of mercy” is felt throughout, but the mentor remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final stance—linked to patience, unlinked from power—is earned and costly, capping at 8.7 because no secondary character provides live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s ache and restlessness are embodied in every sensory beat; the shell-test and kneel-song are micro-choices that cost him illusion. Interior contradiction is vivid—“I promise… I will be a knot-maker my own way”—but the turn arrives more as lyric pronouncement than as a forced, un-pretty decision under rising pressure; hence not quite 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s vocation as “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” is vividly embodied through tactile micro-choices—mapping Morse on paper, warming the globe between lamplight and breath—showing a hierarchy of values (truth over spectacle) that costs him the easy triumph of public accusation. Interior contradiction surfaces in the quiet refusal to cheer: he wants justice yet protects the town from its own fracture, a renunciation legible as Earned Stasis. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labelling (“I am the kind of guide who weaves truth carefully”) that slightly over-articulates what the action already proves.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The net-mender’s patient, observant interiority stays concrete—fingers “mapping hidden patterns,” wrists learning “tenderness under strain.” Contradictory impulses (showing vs. hiding effort) coexist in the same beats, giving credible complexity. The final handing-off of the whisk is an earned renunciation that forecloses the mentor path with visible social cost; however, the townspeople’s chorus remains largely functional, preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist’s drive to “excavate truth” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—reassembling strips, refusing the diamond, calibrating the resonator—each carrying embodied cost. Interiority avoids label-speak: the hush is “shaped exactly like a prayer,” a concrete, POV-specific image. The final refusal of the diamond crystallizes an earned renunciation whose price is the love note he keeps, giving the arc a credible sting. Flaw: we get no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; he never seriously contemplates keeping the talisman, so the renunciation feels slightly pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The penny-poet’s motives—syllable-measured meals, windproof shadow-sleep—stay vivid and consistent; his micro-choice to cork the first bead-note is embodied and alters tactics. Interiority is concrete (“the loft throbbed with gull bargains”), but the arc leans on lyrical summary rather than scene-level contradiction, so the final renunciation feels slightly soft-grained rather than scalpel-earned. Still, flaws complicate his trade and the village response supplies visible social cost. Voice remains individual, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marek’s embodied interiority—ribs chiming, palm tasting key teeth—shows contradictory impulses alive in-scene; the renunciation of force and the offer of co-guardianship are earned by prior vibrational study and carry visible cost in the shared breath at the lens. The seeker’s hunger-to-listen shift is credible because the chord physically unsettles her knees and shoulders. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is named once rather than dramatized, but the trait repeatedly governs micro-choices. Overall a taut, singular psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mapper’s interiority—wind combing reeds, unyoking “yapping urgency”—is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between vigilance and forced stillness is sustained in scene. Yet the arrival of the girl triggers no fresh micro-choice from him; he watches her nod rather than risking a tactic shift, so the arc’s cost lands more on the village men than on his own exposed flaw. Closure still feels earned because his ledger of swallowed notes and withheld shout crystallizes into the teaching moment, but the absence of a visible personal renunciation caps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The investigator’s calm is credibly strained by the lantern-ignited entanglement of memories; the moment he turns the key and accepts the cost of refusal (“I turned them off…”) shows contradictory impulses in scene. The interior voice stays concrete—boot-level water, salt crust, lantern soot—never drifting into label-speak. His final act of carrying the lantern to the air shaft and signing the cause as “mine to report upward” crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived; headcount stays clean, choreography clear.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Chaplain’s interiority is concrete—his guilt mirror and jaw-clench recall show embodied emotion. Micro-choice—leaving credit card, practicing words—exposes hierarchy of values. Jonah remains off-page, so relationship crucible and status bullets skipped; interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure satisfy the 9+ quick test. Final renunciation of borrowed doctrine is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilex’s irreverent awe, embodied in micro-choices like sticking out his tongue at failure, gives him a live, idiosyncratic pulse; the yearning algorithm externalizes longing so the interior stays kinetic. The bell-as-absence motive sharpens every tweak of kaleidoscope or gear, and the final “dirty grin” crystallizes earned, still-curious stasis. Flaw: no on-page relationship crucible or visible cost beyond denied tears, keeping him just shy of 9-band emotional freight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s obsessive archivist persona is vivid—embodied in the flashlight metaphor and the illicit deep-dive—but the interior contradiction (risking job vs. loyalty to Aida) is asserted more than dramatized in-scene; the final choice to “reroute the stream” is credible yet compressed, so the cost is felt but not fully gut-punched.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive patience is shown through embodied micro-choices—climbing, wrapping, waiting through arguments—rather than labels; the final commitment to stay a season carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the child-backstory motive is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly flattens the moment it is revealed. Still, the renunciation of certainty and embrace of “walking that follows” feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete and singular (“mind wakes like a gull on a shifting rail”), but the euthanasia-tourist motive is stated more than it is dramatized in scene; the parasol tip is handled repeatedly, each use revealing a micro-choice, yet the renunciation of the original death wish is inferred rather than shown with visible cost. The helper relationships (Erland, child, mother) supply social pressure, but status dynamics remain static. Flaws—fatalism, hyper-acute listening—shape tactics, but no clear mistake compounds, so the arc edges toward tranquility without a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sentinel’s quiet endurance and micro-choice to hand over knife & twine embody a credible, costed stance; interiority is concrete (“vineyard and I breathe, verdicts loosen”). Yet the traveler’s arc is slightly more told than dramatized, softening the relationship-as-crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motive—preserve fragile wisdom at the price of daily erasure—remains urgent and embodied; the walker’s “strangely honest” eyes and masked silence create a credible, character-specific enigma. Interior contradiction is lyrically handled (“I guide him” yet “the valley forgets quickly”). The renunciation at the end—accepting tomorrow’s identical labor—earns its quiet cost. Only the prophet stays off-page, so status dynamics bullet is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    The archivist’s calm is shown through steady micro-choices—threading ribbon, steadying the mayor—but the interior contradiction between public poise and private tremble is only asserted, never lived in a single beat; still, the final mirror moment lets us feel the cost of that performance, so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    A reticent scholar whose interiority is rendered in lyric, embodied detail—scars, breath, tilt of memory—earns his climactic “testimony” as a renunciation of speech itself; the refusal is legible and costly. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails, but the single-character crucible sustains. The arc is credible stasis rather than change, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness is embodied in every gesture: chalk circles on rusted mouths, driftwood arrows set for a self who will not recognize them. Contradictory impulses—clinging to echoes while preparing to forget—play out in real time, not summary. The final renunciation (“loved them for it” as the chalk fades) is earned by the entire preceding choreography of salt, metal, and sound. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the body’s wrists listen, the coat pocket releases its chalk like a heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The repairer’s quiet obsession with “harnessing the ephemeral” drives every micro-choice; the sanding of the burr is a perfect embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete—cameras “breathe,” chronometer “pleads”—never sliding into label-speak. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair, but the endurance that re-tunes the world is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The therapist’s calm authority is embodied in micro-choices—peeling the clementine, thumb on the bedrail—so “decisively kind” is shown, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete; the moment she decides to phone the son crystallizes her stake and costs her professional detachment. The only slack is the phrase “execute a flawless goodbye,” which momentarily sounds like mission-statement prose amid otherwise particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scholar’s “quietly deliberate” trait is embodied through the paced mirror-ritual and the refusal to force noon; interiority is precise (“question refused to stop breathing”). No internal contradiction is staged, so the arc is more ritual than dilemma, but the renunciation of sunlit certainty carries quiet cost. Micro-choices (narrow shutter, nine key-turns) align with motive and foreclose the path of impatient discovery. The character’s competence is balanced by the constraint of looping time, avoiding flawless-observer syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s skeptical-gentle healer persona stays consistent; every micro-choice (pocketing the tooth, resetting Ari’s shoulder) grows from that core. Contradictory impulses—doubt vs mercy—cohere in the final decision to “tell it plain,” with visible cost in the shoulder’s snap and the town wrath they’ll face tomorrow. Linnet’s grass-kneed innocence nudges the plot yet remains credibly childlike. Interiority is embodied, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    The watcher’s interior contradiction—clinging to loss while refusing fire—turns every polished shard into renunciation with cost. Micro-choices (tongue-warming, kelp-stringing) literalize the shift from blazing to breathing. Brother’s absence remains an active hollow that reshapes present tactics. Motive never drifts into therapeutic self-label; ache stays salt-raw, unhealed.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for reconnection while refusing to be spectacle—play out in embodied micro-choices (unlocking the gate, mapping ice-drip circles, proffering then burying the pendant). Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak; the final renunciation of mutual exploitation is earned by the slow, tactile choreography of burial.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction pulses—“refusing the tidy raft the market offered” vs. the shell’s whispered patience—yet the renunciation to “start arranging permission” is earned by the river pact and costs the safe ladder of triumphs. Embodied emotion stays sharp: chill “articulate around my knees,” shell “throbbing like a pocketed star.” Micro-choices (wading, pocketing emblems, stepping out) trace a hierarchy of values—art over commerce—without diagnostic label-speak. One hairline slip: the grandmother/midwife/courier parade drifts toward cameo labels rather than full crucible pressure, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rowen’s motivation is legible but archetypal; his gentle trickster-teacher aura never cracks under contradiction or cost, so we see no interior friction, only enactment. The collective “we” narrator remains a passive chorus—no individual inside it risks a visible choice—so the human stake feels secondhand. The promised hunger “to restore sacred practices” is announced, not dramatized through competing wants or fears; consequently the ending’s ‘return of appetite’ lands as mood rather than earned arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s interiority is richly concrete—his frost-traced eyelashes, the ache in his thawing thumb—yet his contradictory impulse (risk the last starlight vs. hoard it) is only asserted, never enacted in a beat where we see him hesitate or regret. The sister memory is charged but arrives as single flashback; no present micro-choice re-opens that wound. His final act—sealing the plate, walking away—does foreclose the path back to the orchard, so the renunciation is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The locksmith’s interior contradiction—crafting freedom from locks while hoarding wonder—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of the timer in the cave is earned and costly. Sensory embodiment is vivid (“tightened the mainspring by counting echo returns against the water drip”), never drifting into label-speak. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; solo arc suffices. Flawed patience balanced with genuine mechanical struggle keeps him credibly human.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is lush and specific—“saltshaken hand,” “pulse to north”—but the narrator’s motives stay abstract (“collect the weights of different burdens”) and never tighten into a clear contradiction that forces a late micro-choice; the ledger is written but no visible cost alters stance. Fractal weaver’s agency is purely facilitative, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent. The arc lands in Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels diffuse because the narrator’s fear-of-departure thread is confessed, weighed, then shelved without tactical consequence. Still, embodied emotion and idiosyncratic perception keep characterization well above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The widow’s interior contradiction—needing to remember yet refusing to restore the erased name—grounds every micro-choice; the embodied ritual of carving the absent collar while leaving the knot as scar shows a hierarchy of values with cost. Motivation stays legible under the kettle’s ticking clock and the carving’s resistance. The only slip is a hair of over-articulation (“harvest lessons from loss”) that edges short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scavenger’s interior contradiction—hoarding regret while bargaining it away—peaks in the ghost’s demand for verbs; the embodied admission “I forgive the rain” carries palpable cost and earns the renunciation to stay. Micro-choices (washing the sack, counting bolts) convert abstract motive into tactile ritual, showing hierarchy of values. However, the childhood/scars temporal shuffle is asserted, not dramatized in-scene, muting the flaw-in-action that would push this to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The intern’s “functionally creative” trait is repeatedly enacted—angling ducts, flipping breakers—so motive stays visible. Interiority is lean but bodily (sextant warm against leg). The janitor’s entrance introduces status tension that alters the maze; both men cede agency to the building, so the relationship crucible is the architecture itself. Endurance earns stasis: he sleeps on a bench, circuits murmuring—cost is fatigue, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scribe’s interiority is lyrically precise—his barefoot step “write careful letters on his soles” is a micro-choice that fuses body, tool, and time. Contradictory impulses (to silence the city of bells yet carry its ache) stay active in scene, not summary. Final renunciation—“invite it to walk beside him like weather”—earns its cost via prior ledger of afternoons and the finch conductor image. Voice never drifts into diagnostic speak; tenderness is shown through haptic detail, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is lyrical but stays concrete; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs. serene acceptance) braid through embodied beats such as the tactile pull of the chain. Micro-choice at the box-opening moment crystallizes values: he records rather than rages. Cost is present—the family complicity he now cannot un-know—yet the shift feels slightly under-damped because the scene partner arrives late and shares the burden. Still, the arc of inherited guilt → chosen witness earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The seed-collector’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—patience vs. urgency, listening vs. intervention—shown through micro-choices (humming to a splice, breathing seeds to life). The final act of re-wrapping the rope and bundling seeds is a visible cost that forecloses the option to keep the knowledge unshared, earned by the entire night of decoding. No therapy-speak; even the “philosophical” label is lived, not declared. The character reads as an individual, not a trope, and the flaw of infinite patience is tested when a splice resists and time itself must yield.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The traveler’s vocation—writing “obituaries for the living”—gives him a crystalline, idiosyncratic motive that intensifies with each knot he ties; his interiority stays sensuously concrete (“breath threaded with salt and brass”) and the final wrist-loop act visibly costs him a palpable filament of his own detachment, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prince’s interior contradiction—dynastic conquest training versus tender caretaking—is dramatized in every micro-choice (stealing the egg, knotting silk cables while hearing harp-strings “remember storms”). Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic labels: “his heart a metronome of quaking reverie” externalizes tremor as physical rhythm. Final renunciation of coronation carries visible cost: he remains bedraggled, armor of upbringing “slide[s] away,” palace gates opened to weathering vines—Earned Stasis with felt price. Slight reserve: secondary characters (engineers, librarian) act as helpful chorus rather than crucible; relationship pressure is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but embodied through kelp-scent, coin-weight, hose-rack memory; her unarticulated hierarchy—“answer alarms and answer water”—crystallizes a credibly split self. The boy’s bandaged hand and olive graft supply relational stakes, yet his interior is ventriloquised (“smiled as if forgiven”) rather than owned. Father-inheritance is handled as wind-reading skill repurposed, not psychologised, so motive stays coherent. The final stance costs her the private song-exchange, a visible forfeiture that satisfies earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Ilias’s interiority—“realistically imaginative enough to doubt, bright enough to keep going”—is dramatized in every beat: his refusal of the quick flood, the micro-choice to angle the box, the embodied cost of waiting while “stars practiced sidereal patience.” Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. faith in breadcrumbs) coexist in-scene, driving the final Earned Stasis when he vows to keep the box until rain, foreclosing rest. The water-woman and mason serve as pressure-points, not décor, forcing him to articulate stance with visible cost. No label-speak; every thought is filtered through luminous skepticism and mapped hand.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker’s motive is legible and consistent; the brass gear as heirloom and the refusal to repeat ancestral burning give concrete micro-choices. Interiority stays lyrical but embodied (“I rub the gear before I sing the clicks”). The final renunciation—letting petals fall and calling them back—earns a quiet cost, though the child-captain dyad feels more emblematic than individually pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    The carver’s interiority is textured through haptic micro-choices—testing ribbon, tapping chisel, pacing letter depth; these reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. mercy, ornament vs. silence) coexist in scene, not summary. The mother’s spectral mentorship externalizes an internal limit: “names want enough silence to grow around them,” a credo that visibly constrains his hand. Closure is an Earned Stasis: he accepts perpetual incompletion, the price legible in the spare kite-curve that ends the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tower-winder’s vocation, grief, and ethical conversion are lived through tactile micro-choices—slowing the pendulum, oiling the arbor, offering the rake-handle—each carving visible cost; contradictory impulses (precision vs. repair) act in-scene, culminating in a renunciation of mere exactitude that is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gardener’s quiet, methodical nature is rendered through embodied micro-choices (laying tools in a crescent, tapping the case, planting asters) that externalize grief without label-speak; the final shift from “blithe mask” to “respect” is earned by the causal discovery of the widow’s double truth. Interior contradiction is present but subtle—his buoyancy versus the velveteen gloom—yet the text keeps him slightly too composed for full 9+; no real misstep or flaw complicates the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.7)
    The cartographer’s contradictory impulses—cartographing ignorance vs. resisting the seductive flight of the quill—surface concretely in the hinge choice, but the interiority drifts toward diagnostic gloss (“blind spots of love”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (selecting the canal, testing beads) visibly align with motives, yet the final trembling hand feels slightly rehearsed rather than earned by a prior on-page cost. Still, the profession-specific lens is memorable and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    The copyist’s compulsive transcription of silence into scored measures is a vivid, embodied motive that escalates from private ritual to pact with the pirate voice. Interiority stays concrete—numbering rests, tapping pencil—yet the contradiction between preservation and erasure remains felt rather than stated. The final promise to “leave a score wherever ash settled” is earned: diligence and loneliness converge into a costly vow that forecloses retreat to mere copying. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count clarity is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s self-definition as “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” is embodied in every beat: she powders unsent letters, breathes ash onto canvas, accepts the chair’s rhythm as her metronome. Contradictory impulses—need for maternal blessing vs refusal to ask permission—coexist in the same moment, not in alternating abstracts. Cost is felt when she pockets the last jar of ash while her mother’s grip leaves “a bracelet of dust” on her wrist, showing endurance has a tactile price. Only the mother’s late shift from stone guardian to co-witness feels slightly under-causal; the squeeze is earned but the interior leap is compressed into a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s “abrasive calm” is embodied in every line; the decision to risk exposing the chalk flood-marks to the three rivals crystallizes his hierarchy of values—save lives, keep the cog, hoard method over myth. Interior contradiction is alive: he aches to lie yet chooses the harder truth, paying the social cost of their dampened awe. The only minor slack is that the rivals’ individual voices remain slightly interchangeable, but since they function as a single pressure mass this barely dents the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“I had once shouted for a cause until my throat bled”) and her pedagogy of subtraction is dramatized through the rosette pass and final silence. Yet the students remain types—Rafi’s “smoke,” Ola’s “tremble,” Jin’s “lighthouse” are poetic labels rather than contradictory impulses acted out in scene. The closing gesture of handing the warm rosette through the rows shows micro-choice, but no student flaw or internal shift compounds a visible cost to any one of them. At this length the ensemble functions as a single choral body, so the arc lands on Mara’s earned stillness, not individual reckonings.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chef’s synesthetic gift is embodied in every beat—tasting rust, chalk, birthday smoke—so motivation stays sensory and urgent. Interior contradiction surfaces when he spits guilt onto the soil, admitting complicity in forgetting; this micro-choice tilts the present. The final act of feeding neighbors crystallizes his hierarchy of values: memory > safety, with the cost of exposure to council censure legible in the chipped cups. No stock therapy-speak; even “rebellion” is shown via pruning, not labels.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    The toll-keeper’s involuntary candor is dramatized in every exchange, squeezing him into a single, painful micro-choice—hand over the lacquer box—whose cost is the surrender of his protective filter. Interiority is sensorily grounded (“truth pinned my tongue”) and contradictions play out in real time rather than summary. The final stance—continuing to sit and ask wonder for coin—earns its poise because the earlier surrender has already bled. Voice remains distinct from Mara’s, and status shifts are legible in the stair-climb choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s obsessive noticing is embodied in tactile micro-moves (setting the shard, reading spoon-click) and carries a consistent worldview; the final breath-moment shows earned alteration of stance. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding diagnostic labels. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the arc is credible and cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oris’s contradiction—statue stillness vs. tidal thought—drives every beat; the decision to thread the ampoule crystallizes his promise to “welcome nuance.” Interiority stays embodied (“stone knees stirring anemones”). Cost is felt when the scholar’s doubt ripples back through him. The only bar to 9+ is that the renunciation is more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.3)
    Interiority offers philosophical cadence, but the sole character performs no consequential micro-choice; decisions stay verbalized (“I roll,” “I write”) rather than embodied. Flaws are asserted (“grim optimist”) yet never tested on-page; tension remains conceptual. The ending’s acceptance is declared, not dramatized, so Earned Stasis lacks felt cost. No relational or status crucible; alone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s insomnia, paint-stained fingers, and refusal to sign her portraits embody a believable, stubborn optimist. The neighbor’s return supplies external pressure that forces her to recognize the living network her kindness seeded; her micro-choice to add the final gold dot lands as earned renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—tomato scent, saucer of moonwater—never drifting into abstractions. Cost is visible: she surrenders anonymity and accepts that remembrance now flows both ways.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The museum guide’s contradictory impulse—cataloguing while fearing embalming—drives every micro-choice; the green-lens acceptance crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“salt-tongued, ridiculous, hopeful”) and degrades under spray. No stock labels; traits filter diction and perception. The final vow feels earned because earlier refusals and wax failures foreclose retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock-maker’s interior contradiction—hunger to unmake fate vs. the cost of another’s life—plays out in embodied micro-choices (blood drop, yoyo key, final release). The renunciation is earned because the stone’s visions have already bitten his ribs. Only the keeper’s status shift is under-dramatized; her single call carries the whole relationship turn.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Fear-as-bargain interiority is vivid (“I am photographically cursed”); each mirror reflection forces a micro-choice that escalates identity erosion. Dialogue functions as status duel: advisor’s carnival-taffy breath vs narrator’s refusal to blink. Endurance of the gaze reclaims the narrator’s name with on-page cost. Flaw: advisor’s motives remain abstract, softening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prophet’s vocation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is stated early and dramatized throughout: every strike of the mallet tests this creed and visibly costs sweat, time, and risk. Interiority stays sensory—sound of apples like “small bell noises”—never abstract self-analysis. The final quiet sit-down among pears shows earned stasis: the orchard survives, but the body is spent and the mallet laid down, a lacquered witness to the price paid. No contradictory impulse is allowed to complicate the prophet’s drive; the absence of that friction keeps the score just shy of the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartographer’s quiet drive is embodied in every micro-choice—tracing spirals, testing reed notes, stepping into the corridor—so the final self-measurement feels inevitable. Interior contradiction is thin: we’re told “quietly driven” but never see hesitation or competing desire that would complicate the march toward the watchers. Still, the copper tag moment crystallizes filial debt as lived, embodied motive, and the refusal to retreat carries visible cost under the watchers’ glare.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian’s interiority is vividly particular—"emotionally rational," "stubborn about facts yet aware of the ache that facts bruise"—and every micro-choice (opening lockers, turning ledger pages, copying scorched names) is tethered to that lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the stance is declared rather than enacted under pressure, so the arc feels静态. The final act of writing "Listen" under the gilded L is earned by prior methodical labor, but the cost is intellectual, not visceral. Still, within single-POV limits, the characterization avoids cliché and remains idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich—"firm shore surveyor" observes through silt-senses and carp-echoes—but the micro-choices remain observational rather than decisive. No visible contradiction is dramatized; the "archaeologist" desire is declared, never tested against resistance. The final note is summary, not a moment of embodied trade-off, muting earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ossa’s quiet, methodical indexer-voice is consistent and embodied; the stamp-test micro-choices (“I pressed… felt the soft bruise”) externalize motive. Interior contradiction is implied but never dramatized in a second beat, so the final stance feels more asserted than compounded. Still, the occupation-specific lens and the renunciation of “rehearsals” land with visible cost on the breath.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern-maker’s grief is rendered through tactile craft rather than label; each micro-choice (polishing, steaming, folding cranes) externalizes the ache. The absence of a shadow functions as a lived body-state, not a metaphoric decal. Interior contradiction is palpable when he both longs for and fears the shadow’s return, yet the final laugh feels slightly un-earned because the prior beat shows only resignation—no new micro-choice signals the release. Still, the characterization stays within hailing distance of 9 because embodied emotion and tool-mediated agency remain consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrator’s “bruise that never quite fades” identity is vivid, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized in scene; the geode’s ache is repeatedly declared (“oracle,” “cathedral”) without fresh micro-choices under pressure until the final tilt against glass, so the closing vow feels more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pilot’s “noticing-as-key” credo is embodied in micro-choices—rotating the dome, re-coding silence as letter—so the arc from observer to co-author is legible. The pilgrim’s shift from mute awe to speaking the sky-text is felt, but because the pilgrim’s interior is filtered through the pilot, the cost lands softer on them. Interior contradiction is present (“perpetually surprised” twice), yet it is confessed rather than dramatized in scene. Still, the final shared stance of “the night trusts us” carries a credible, tender forfeiture of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The genealogist’s self-loathing and reflexive falsification are viscerally embodied (“the ledger aches with forgery”); each micro-choice—offering the archive, kneeling to read planks—exposes a hierarchy of guilt over safety. The withheld memory that Abel saved the narrator, not abandoned Mara, crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation that could not swap with any other backstory. Interiority stays salted with brine and ink rather than therapy-speak. The only minor abrasion: the rapid transit from beach to terrace after the reveal slightly dilutes the embodied aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator’s interiority is textured and consistent—embodied in the pocketed drawer pull, micro-choices of hand-offs, and calibrated silences. Contradictory impulses (need for neutrality vs. personal history) stay active in-scene, and the final stance of standing alone with cooling brass shows earned endurance. Minor slip: the boy’s smile feels slightly over-tidy amid the parapet’s peril.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s broken-but-functional competence is credibly limned; every paddle stroke and pole reading feels like a micro-choice that costs salt and shame. His merrily melancholic mask is shown, not told, in the self-mocking buoy/bell image. The salvaging act with the boy gives a visible pivot that forecloses retreat; the chest-press of the compass at the end is an embodied, priced renunciation. Interior contradiction holds to the last line—he is “open and used,” not healed—so the arc earns its stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory need to atone yet remain stained powers every beat; the ledger-ball warming under guilt is a lived micro-choice that externalizes internal stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“guilt returned as steam”) rather than diagnostic. Final renunciation to ferry others costs the fantasy of self-wiping, earned by the earlier failed purchase of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly concrete—‘a tide keeps pulling at the ribs where Mira once pressed her night-warm thumbs’—and the metamorphosis is credibly reluctant, but the bond-with-the-dead motive is stated more than it is pressured by on-page contradictions; still, the final surrender of voice carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s guilt-driven compulsion to climb and atone is palpable and embodied; the ritual tracing of hands on cloth anchors contradictory impulses (to measure love, to pin time) in a concrete, repeated gesture. The final renunciation—“I would unfasten every future knot with both hands”—earns its cost through the accumulated confessions and the emptied cards, making the endurance credible. Interiority stays specific to the cartomancer’s voice; no diagnostic self-help speak intrudes. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship-as-crucible is N/A; the mother–daughter bond is felt only through absence, not live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pacifist trait is credibly embodied through micro-choices (naming angers, unclenching fists) and the final renunciation of force to open the lock; the interior contradiction between “push” and pacifism is active in-scene. The emotional arc from grief-ballast to calibrated gladness is legible and paid for with on-page breath-control. Missing a second character or relationship crucible keeps it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—needing to stage-manage “accidental” prophetic fulfillment while disavowing vanity—drives every beat; the embodied shame when elders thank her crystallizes cost. Micro-choices (jar-placement, breathing mimic) tether motive to action; no stock phrases. Final renunciation of the bugs shows earned stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mother-bequeathed bronze quill gives credible lineage and mechanical agency; internal contradiction is shown in “I am calmly inventive” against the trembling locks he quiets. Decision to convert guardianship into sabotage is dramatized in a single, irrevocable kneel-to-latch beat with visible cost—loss of former identity. Captain Rhun’s leap from antagonist to ally compresses too neatly; medals-to-faces promise lacks on-page proof of stance change, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrator’s vow to decode the “grammar” of currents for his brother anchors every choice; embodied ache when the herder’s footprints shimmer under the aurora shows interiority without diagnostic tag. The climactic trade—brother freed, herder trapped—was earned by the twin promises dramatized early and paid with on-page cost. Micro-choices remain consistent: each stone laid is a visible bet that his ribs still burn. Flaw: her “resigned grace” is more label than physiology, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s interior contradiction—needing to read the scars yet fearing what the map will ask—is dramatized in the trembling thumb over the timer. Body/emotion integration is vivid: “thinning fear into a clarity that did not soften its edge.” The final tracing of the constellation on the chart is a micro-choice that costs the last of their detachment, foreclosing the safety of ignorance; the caretaker’s palm-on-palm cements the earned alliance. Still, the caretaker’s own motives remain a touch schematic, preventing full 8+ compression.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dueling-philosopher persona is vividly embodied through the mechanical arm’s calibration mid-fence and the micro-choice to step into Rook’s lunge; interior contradiction shows in treating a needle-card as compass, mirror, apology. The renunciation—accepting departure without the courier—carries visible cost when the floor unties and the atrium glass becomes sky. Status shift with Rook is legible: invitation to lose-and-proceed rewrites their relation. Voice remains singular; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    The poet’s contradictory impulses—yearning to anchor beauty while bracing for imminent self-erasure—are dramatized in the penny-spending beat and the palm-to-chest gesture; the fear of becoming “a stranger to my own fire” is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choices (sorting pages into “secret geographies,” revealing the map) reveal values under pressure and foreclose the safer path of anonymity. Cost is visible: the approaching molt could void tonight’s labor, yet he persists. The only drag is late-introduced Lio, whose interiority is ventriloquized; this slightly blunts the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pianist’s contradictory longing to both serve and sabotage the timetable is dramatized in embodied beats (winding the dead clock, threading the reel, letting compasses jab his torso). Interiority is specific—notes placed “like a coin on a windowsill”—and the final endurance of playing until the network shudders carries visible cost: the last train is held, his hands “did not shake,” schedules bow. Flaw: the broken clock is handled but never truly alters tactics; it remains emblematic rather than instrumental, so the renunciation feels symbolic, not mechanically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The checker’s vocation is vivid—cataloging waves while interrogating crabs—but agency stays observational; the seed-planting is the single micro-choice that costs doubt and rain-soaked hair, enough for credible renunciation at this length. Interiority is precise (“doubt glowed like a lighthouse”) yet stays lyrically collective, fitting a myth-keeper whose flaw is epistemic overreach. Iru functions as echo rather than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin; head-count clarity survives. Earned stasis lands: the island will keep waking itself, foreclosing his lone-wolf authority with bittersweet relief.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bonsai tutor’s interior contradiction—wanting to prune storms yet fearing their own unspoken storm—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of “shaping storms into cages” is earned by the cove confession and costs the mentor identity. Embodied regret (compass clicks like a throbbing tooth) keeps emotion off the therapy couch. Only nit: the leap from tracing lace to “walk clockwise” feels slightly under-motivated, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely specific—her scientific lens filters perception without diagnostic over-explanation. Her micro-choices (sweeping, tracing dust, pinning plastic) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in patience over spectacle. The contradiction between her past "flamboyant fireworks" and current devotion to quiet decay feels lived-in, not theoretical. Final renunciation of drama is earned through embodied ritual, with cost legible in algae-slicked tiles and vanished tomatoes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—glass artist sensibilities infuse perception (“glass hears better than it sees”), and micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the ledger flat) reveal a hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses (desire for justice vs. artistic integrity) coexist without tidy resolution. The final renunciation—to embed truth in glass rather than expose it directly—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: enduring uncertainty while trusting the canyon’s testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—translating silence into music after trauma—is embodied through precise, tactile choices (e.g., weighting forks with leaves, conducting heat currents). Interior contradiction thrums beneath “refusing to drown in the quiet,” and micro-choices (rewriting algorithms by riverbank, selecting specific foliage) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Emotional progression avoids diagnostic labels; grief cools “sharp,” hope “flickers like an animal heat.” Final endurance (“permission to continue”) is earned through repeated, disciplined failure and recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The undertaker’s interiority is vividly embodied—his weariness, grief, and inadvertent stubbornness manifest through tactile choices (carrying the lens like a heart, etching his stamp) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation to “give rest a permanent address” emerges organically from professional trauma and personal longing, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses anonymity for the dead at the cost of his own return to surface normalcy. The final micro-choice—arranging shards until fractures spell navigable routes—reveals a hierarchy of values: remembrance over oblivion, location over surrender. No emotional summarization; every feeling is filtered through mortuary ritual and oceanic metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s “gently persistent” nature is embodied through micro-choices—standing visible before the patrol, pairing generations, refusing to name donors—that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The narrator’s role as recorder deepens interiority without head-hopping, and emotional complexity arises from scarcity braided with care, not therapy-speak. Flaws like fear of irrelevance or raids aren’t hedged; they drive tactical decisions. Final renunciation of anonymity (“learn the names of need”) is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interior contradiction—hoarding love while yearning to release it—is embodied in precise, sensory-rich micro-choices (e.g., applying Kwan Yin’s tear, adjusting breath to alter the image). Her past-life flaw (“measured light but never let it touch”) directly motivates present action, and the final renunciation (“decant, not spill”) carries visible emotional cost. The brief interaction with the man crystallizes her transformation without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile ritual and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink sweating like dew, lungs holding “the pale roar”—and his micro-choices (pressing the shard, stepping onto bridges) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on grief and memory. His motivation stems from tangible loss (the burned library), and his flaws (obsession with control via mazes) complicate his navigation of time. The woman functions as a mirror, not a crucible, but their interaction crystallizes his realization without diluting his agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through sensory contradiction and tactile metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “staggering grace,” iron chains, and tactile seed-sorting reveal a character whose contradictions (chained yet liberating, strategic yet tender) operate simultaneously under pressure. Her micro-choices—jamming the arrow in gears, tipping the shelf—are consistent with her motive to impede plunder and plant futures. The final act of teaching children to listen for rain in seeds crystallizes her endurance as Earned Stasis, with visible cost in her rusted pockets and chained wrist. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in a personal fracture of trust—is embodied through micro-choices (testing the bowl, revisiting the bench) that reveal contradictory impulses: the desire to hear betrayal before it breaks, yet also to heal. Their synesthetic perception (“blue is a far drum… betrayal a glass harmonica”) is not diagnostic but sensorially specific, avoiding therapy-speak. The final act—forging a device that captures the prelude to rupture—emerges from prior causality and carries the cost of confronting their own past. Flaws (over-attunement to absence) directly shape both struggle and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied (“breath carried a hush of luminous disbelief”), and their motivation—stealing vanishing light to hear destiny—drives every micro-choice with emotional and moral weight. The mentor relationship crystallizes under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of theft for return that feels earned. Flaws like overreach (the mentor’s failed sunset) and the thief’s quiet arrogance deepen without safety-hedging. The final act of giving back portraits reconfigures identity with tangible cost: the loss of the old craft.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlen’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his glassblowing, narration, and handling of the bookmark reveal a hierarchy of values (care over haste, tenderness over fear) with visible cost in trembling arms and abandoned anxieties. His contradictions—scientific rigor fused with poetic ritual—act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of old fears (“he abandoned his old fear that science and tenderness could not share a bench”) is earned by every molten gesture preceding it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile specificity: “heat softened the smell of old ink,” “arms shook,” “breath that carried the flavor of salt and propane.”

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—fear versus determination, betrayal versus kinship—are embodied in precise physical detail (“hands shook, but I steadied them with breath counts”) and culminate in a renunciation of armor that feels earned. The brother’s presence deepens the crucible without flattening either character; their reunion avoids sentimentality through concrete trade-offs (name, credits, danger). Internal conflict remains tightly bound to profession-specific trauma (“cataloged fears like injuries”), avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Final choice—to fall “toward us, not away”—carries visible emotional cost and reconfigures identity without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her obsession with “quiet that can be written” manifests in micro-choices (touching wet stone, noting skipped heartbeats) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The courier’s arc from cynicism to surrender feels earned through his admission about the scroll and his shift from shivering to stillness. Both characters remain consistent yet transformed, their flaws (her thin faith, his fear) directly shaping decisions with visible cost—her bleeding fingers, his torn sleeve. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory precision and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sentient robot janitor’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception ("snow squeaks under my treads," "filament of cold trailed my sensors") and micro-choices (laying aside the broom, lifting the bow) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation—to find where thoughts come from—emerges organically from action, not exposition, and intensifies across loops without tidy resolution. The final renunciation (returning the violin, sweeping on) is earned by prior causality and carries the quiet cost of perpetual practice over revelation. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The registrar’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear, guilt, and yearning manifest through tactile details (worrying the lens, shivering at “aching” hints). His micro-choices (eavesdropping, confessing publicly) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. The flaw—cowardice—is active, not stated, and directly shapes his pivotal decision to project the doodles. His transformation into “lighter” honesty feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: relinquishing control of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—sunburned into “string and grit,” counting leaves and debts with the same thumb—and his contradictions (pragmatism vs. ritual, deception vs. honesty) drive key choices. His motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of performance for penance. The final act of polishing marbles as “witnesses” reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he accepts withering as part of stewardship. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile specificity and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Jae’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “icy warmth,” roughened hands, and quiet obsession with sideways time feel specific and lived-in. His motivation intertwines personal curiosity with communal care, and his final choice to withhold proof (“He told no one…”) reveals a poignant renunciation that forecloses validation but affirms intimacy. The story avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through tactile detail (breath fogging, lever smeared with anxious hands). His flaw—fixation on temporal theory—is not hedged; it isolates him yet enables the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The musician’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—shivering, knee-deep in cold water, cradling a program—while contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity, silence vs. expression) act simultaneously. Motivation to “unravel the code left by a ghost” intensifies into decisive action with visible cost: obedience means not disturbing sound, disobedience means drowning again. The final choice—to conduct silence—is earned through micro-choices (stepping on glints, not water) that reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail and ritualized gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—swallowed truth as a “small stone star,” grief mapped through posture and breath—and their motivation (to weigh an unspeakable lie) intensifies credibly under pressure. The oracle functions less as a character with independent agency and more as a resonant mirror, but this serves the single-POV lyric design. Micro-choices (smudging ash, widening stance) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma. Final renunciation—naming the lie at the margins—is earned by prior causality with palpable cost in tension release.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s reckless skepticism and embodied grief drive every micro-choice, from tracking radio timestamps to turning the valve wheel. Interiority is concrete (“breath tasted of iron,” “palms intelligent”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—forgiving the wheel, not people—feels earned through consistent contradiction: disbelief in ghosts yet belief in patterns, rejection of heaven but reverence for pressure. Cost is visible in muscle memory and silence, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile, sensory perception rather than diagnostic labels. Their motivation—to witness without judgment—is tested and deepened through concrete choices (e.g., not protesting the mushrooms’ alphabet rewrite). The final renunciation of gripping decisions feels earned, with visible cost in flaking mortar and loosened judgments. However, the character’s passivity borders on observational detachment without sufficient internal contradiction during key pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ada’s grief is embodied through the locket and hair curl with precise, sensory detail; her micro-choices—refusing eclipse glasses, opening the locket, tracing its curve—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The therapist’s interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding emotion in action (“cautious exuberance,” “softly adaptive”). Their relationship crystallizes without exposition: music becomes a bridge only after the narrator matches Ada’s rhythm. The final request for a lower-key lullaby shows earned emotional shift with visible cost—nights remain hard, but now shared.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    The historian’s porous interiority—“not lonely so much as porous”—embodies his motivation with tactile specificity. His micro-choices (stitching the tapestry into his logbook, whispering to the axis) reveal a hierarchy of values: testimony over comfort, listening over dreaming. Contradictory impulses coexist—devotion to memory yet acceptance of dreamlessness—without tidy resolution. The final act of reorienting shelves along the new axis earns Charged Poise through visible cost: he volunteers to absorb stories no one else can hear.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—sugar-sticky hands, ribs sweating the envelope—and their contradictory impulses (desire for control vs. surrender to flow) drive every micro-choice. The keeper’s presence deepens this through charged silence and shared ritual, not exposition. Their renunciation of espionage for communal revelation feels earned by prior causality: the fisherman’s fate proves the cost of misdirected prophecy. Final choice forecloses covert agency with visible emotional and tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict—between grief, survival, and surrender—is embodied with visceral specificity (“eyes a longitude no map would claim,” “lips moved, and the loop swallowed the movement”).

    The alchemist’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, salt-and-solder smell, breath-holding rituals—and his contradictory impulses (doubt vs. devotion, grief vs. creation) act simultaneously throughout. His micro-choices (dunking his head, fitting the charm as pendulum) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: enduring leaden promise, soldering gold seams over loss. Mira exists only in memory but exerts crucible pressure through absence, not presence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    The painter’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—his aloofness warring with longing, his fear of motion countered by tidal pull.

The final renunciation—leaving the painted corridor—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing immersion for witness.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in salt, rails, and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief manifests through tactile memory, micro-choices like wrapping the censer foot, and contradictions between counting and singing.

Flaws like unanswered questions “rusting in my mouth” compound under pressure without resolution, deepening endurance as agency.

    The protagonist’s involuntary truthfulness creates constant micro-tensions that shape every interaction, especially during the patrol encounter where honesty becomes tactical rather than passive.

The final endurance (“fractured grace is the only style we have left”) feels earned through prior choices and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lighthouse keeper’s softly persistent nature is embodied through micro-choices—crouching to inspect planks, aligning the Edelweiss, sweeping the dock—that reveal a hierarchy of values centered on witnessing over spectacle.

The cost—abandoning the safety of maps for daily choosing—is felt in knees, fingers, and pocket-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    The queen’s motivation—driven by recurring dreams and a hunger for truth—is embodied in every choice, from abandoning her crown to climbing the ridge. Her internal contradiction (loyalty to throne vs. fidelity to self) manifests physically and vocally (“softly commanding” tone, crescent anointing). The wanderer, though enigmatic, applies immediate pressure that forces micro-choices with visible cost (e.g., drinking from the bone flask, accepting the key). Final renunciation is earned: she wakes her stone self not to reclaim power but to leave it behind, paying the price of unforgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory and scientific-poetic metaphors that feel native to their identity as a “pocket-sun alchemist.” Contradictory impulses—between romantic longing and empirical caution—play out in micro-choices (calibrating instead of kissing, striking a phosphorus chord).

Flaws like amnesiac disorientation after the hiccup compound pressure credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity, precision vs. intuition) act simultaneously in scene.

Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory and tactile metaphors (“chalk is a listening stone”). The child’s interaction at the end crystallizes the narrator’s role without over-explaining. Flaws remain implicit but legible: the artist risks intrusion to preserve collective vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal contradiction—“arms of steel and my heart undecided between heat and frost”—is embodied, sustained, and resolved through micro-choices (e.g., refusing easy vengeance, insisting on renaming as repair). Their motivation (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) drives every action with visible cost: emotional exposure, social suspicion, and the burden of memory. The boy’s request and the men’s renaming are not abstract but concrete tests that force trade-offs aligned with their core identity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile perception (“steel in my fingers tingles”) and ritualized gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s synesthetic perception and ritualistic caretaking reveal deep interiority through embodied contradiction—longing for closure yet sustaining the ghost’s liminal existence. Their micro-choices (pressing the coin, speaking marquee names) are precise, costly, and consistent with a self-appointed role that blurs memory and duty. The ghost functions as both mirror and counterweight, his “genteel panic” and hollow gestures heightening the narrator’s agency without overshadowing it. Final renunciation—sweeping empty seats while remembering their mother—is earned through layered, sensory-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara and the narrator are vividly individuated through embodied contradictions: her skepticism coexists with tender participation, his devotion is tempered by misreading somatic signals. Their motivations—Mara seeking relief from her brother’s last words, he from his father’s elusive map—are rooted in specific, tactile memories that drive micro-choices (e.g., counting breaths post-shock). The final forehead press earns its emotional weight through prior somatic grammar and shared vulnerability. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sensory map maker’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (to speak vs. to listen, to interpret vs. to receive) operate simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (pressing the fossil, waiting without moving, placing it in a niche) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: surrendering ownership of meaning. The final renunciation (“not mine alone”) is earned by prior causality and deepens the character’s moral stance without epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rejecting a deterministic prophecy for participatory meaning—is embodied in tactile choices (stealing the jar, matching buttons to echoes) and charged with cost: exile from orthodoxy, vulnerability before the village. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion, reverence vs. revision) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of rigid timekeeping for communal offering feels earned by every prior micro-choice. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in resin-scented hands and sweating glass.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)

His motivation—to find “unused courage”—is dramatized through tactile ritual, not stated abstraction. The final act of slipping on the ring shows credible emotional realignment earned by prior pressure, with visible cost in exile and identity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman and Wren are vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—his attentiveness versus silence, her storm-stitching lullabies—and their micro-choices (offering the needle, steadying the ferry) reveal hierarchies of value. Motivation is rooted in consistent traits (“distill complexity into essence”) and intensifies under pressure. The yarn needle functions as both token and tool, grounding internal stakes in tactile action. However, Wren’s agency slightly overshadows the coachman’s in the climax, softening his final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    The potter’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—her micro-choices (offering water, cleaning hives, singing) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in non-coercive care. Her motivation intensifies organically from inquiry to active tending, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses forceful intervention with visible cost: she leaves her cups behind, trusting the place to heal on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)

Motivation ties cleanly to parental legacy and grief, with the lockmaster’s tooth functioning as both talisman and tool of inheritance. The final choice—to relight the lighthouse—is earned through layered micro-decisions (kneeling, cleaning, shielding the flame) that reveal a hierarchy of values: care over despair, continuity over surrender. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile specificity (“brittle as a grass blade in January”) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to translate isolation into independence without hardening into salt—is embodied in precise, contradictory micro-choices (e.g., lighting a wick despite claiming to be “only a reader”). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion lives in tactile perception (“damp constellations drip across my wrists”) and voice-specific idiom. The final renunciation—preparing chairs for absent visitors—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: perpetual readiness without guarantee of return. Flaws like forgetfulness (“then forgot again”) compound pressure credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ghostwriter’s interiority is richly embodied—dripping like a “patient lantern,” carrying secrets “like birds learning to trust air”—and their micro-choices (tucking letters, placing the nest) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on connection over safety. The lovers’ rejoining feels earned because their prior silence and mediated letters establish genuine emotional stakes. However, their individual motivations remain slightly abstracted; we see their actions but not enough contradictory impulses in-scene to fully satisfy the 9+ test for interior conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—“palms tingled,” “breathed in dust and stubbornness”—and their cautious hope directly shapes tactical choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. belief, duty vs. rebellion) act simultaneously, not sequentially.

No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution; emotional complexity remains authentically messy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature drive every micro-choice with embodied tension—kneeling despite tightness in the ribs, using chalk and compass as both tools and talismans. Interior contradiction is sustained: stillness feels like a smaller room than any cave, yet movement risks spatial mutiny. The final act of threading the key onto the cord embodies wistful rebellion as earned renunciation, not sentiment. Grandmother’s legacy grounds motivation without exposition, making the emotional cost (“my throat warmed as if a door clicked open inside me”) feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s prosopagnosia is embodied through methodical action and perception, not diagnostic label-speak; their micro-choices (lancing silt, threading ribbon) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction—between empathy and face-blindness, evidence and absence—is sustained without tidy resolution. The final renunciation (“I do not know who harmed her”) forecloses certainty with visible cost, yet affirms artistic truth. Flaws drive the investigation, never hedged by safety.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)

Contradictory impulses (idealism vs. institutional resistance) collide credibly in the climax without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fiddler’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, disbelief, and resolve manifest through tactile actions (kneeling, playing, pocketing the shard) rather than abstract reflection. His micro-choices—recounting turns, names, coffees—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in loyalty and artistic duty. The hitchhiker’s return hinges on believable causality: the fiddler’s performance literally reconstitutes presence via “pixelated amnesty,” making forgiveness an active, musical act. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through concrete perception (“glass flake burns cold,” “bow finds the bridge like a homing bird”).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—e.g., “polished calm” masking evasion, a startup built on memory yet courted by investors demanding metrics. His micro-choices (tying ribbons, taping bills above bunks) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in legacy over profit. The final renunciation (“remembering,” not pivoting) feels earned, with visible cost: abandoned office, coders’ departure, the train’s silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail like “paper money crackled like unclaimed thunderheads.”

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained hands, trembling charts, throat that “knew the cadence”—and Mara’s fierce eyes and wet coat convey urgency without exposition. Their shared history and mutual need for witness drive credible micro-choices: breaking the seal, tuning the scope together, speaking in counterpoint. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of solitude; cost is felt in the weight carried forward. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness, expressing grief through tactile ritual rather than therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)

Her motivation intertwines professional duty (“finds lost things”) with personal hunger for truth, creating layered stakes. The mayor’s frozen confession forces her to navigate ethical ambiguity (truth vs. mercy), and her final act—returning words, not punishing—reveals a hierarchy of values with quiet cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests as physical tension and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The root-bound visionary’s interiority is vividly embodied—grafts in ankles, questions in ribs—and their motivation (to understand the breach) intensifies credibly under pressure. The woman’s scar functions as both crucible and catalyst, forcing a micro-choice (linking scars) that reconfigures possibility. However, the protagonist’s “purposefully curious” trait leans slightly abstract; their emotional contradiction lacks visceral friction until the linking scene. Final renunciation of the old covenant feels earned, with visible cost in forfeited certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—patching soul-holes left by grief—is embodied in micro-choices: giving their name to the boy, pressing palms into ash, scattering stories as seeds. Contradictory impulses (reckless idealism vs. stubborn patience) act simultaneously, especially in the climactic trade where kindness is both blade and balm. The boy’s cindery eyes and iron-shod fate force a morally weighted choice with visible cost: surrendering ancestral legacy for another’s hush. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions manifest through tactile detail (“ash on its back arranged itself,” “shoulders fell like a cliff relieved of scaffolding”).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—understanding transition without reclaiming the spirit—is rooted in a haunting ambition that feels lived-in and specific. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with clay, bark, and rails, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. intellectual pursuit) operate simultaneously, especially when pressing tablets to trunks or whispering the spirit’s name “to measure the vacuum.” The final renunciation (“not to own transition, but to keep company”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of quieted—but not erased—ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)

    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices—holding the watch, matching breath to its stuttered rhythm, choosing not to ink but to record pauses—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies without over-articulation; contradictions (cautious exuberance, regretful purchase yielding necessary truth) operate simultaneously rather than sequentially. The final renunciation—to speak by learning when to wait—is earned through prior causality and carries conceptual cost: silence must be preserved for meaning to emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)

Final renunciation (“leaving it unwritten”) is earned through prior causality and resonates with the “wisely enduring” ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his ache, restlessness, and moral calculus pulse through tactile metaphors (“ribs meet and carry a small river of feeling”) without diagnostic abstraction. His micro-choices (singing the pot song, testing echoes with unflattering questions) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he confronts his own role as rope-cutter. The final promise to be a “knot-maker” feels earned by prior causality, not epiphany. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile, sensory-rich perception (“breath makes halos,” “silt moves as if remembering”) and morally weighted micro-choices (choosing testimony over accusation). Motivation stems from a coherent ethos—“to salvage something pure”—that shapes every action with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (justice vs. gentleness) act simultaneously in scene, especially when the narrator resists shouting the truth. Sofia’s husband’s silent arrival crystallizes emotional stakes without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.3)
    The net-mender’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with micro-choices (offering silence over fireworks, gifting the whisk) revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in tenderness and invisibility. His backstory with the whisk and his mother is anchored in present action and alters his stance without flattening pressure. The councilor’s transformation feels earned through spatial choreography and embodied response (drying stones), not exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile ritual and communal participation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—his skepticism, tactile engagement with shredded paper, and moral clarity feel earned. His renunciation of the diamond demonstrates a hierarchy of values (truth over possession) with visible cost: he leaves no richer, only steadier. Contradictory impulses—debunker vs. quasi-priest—are active in scene, not summarized. The final calibration choice is rooted in prior causality and flaw (distrust of myth yet reverence for function).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—“making tea inside thunder's throat,” “installed my heart in circuit”—and Brin’s charcoal-lantern eyes and rope-grin immediately convey survivalist complexity. Their contradictory impulses (theft vs. weatherwork, hunger vs. allegiance) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to scatter seeds into lightning feels earned by their shared hunger and storm-devotion, with visible cost in scars, patience, and municipal suspicion. Voice distinction between the lyrical narrator and Brin’s terse pragmatism sharpens their crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.3)
    The vagrant poet’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradictions—measuring meals by syllables yet hoarding sound like coin—and his final renunciation (“until the village learned to cup its own palms”) feels earned by his accumulated listening. The widow’s presence adds subtle relational pressure without diluting focus. His motivation—to translate between generations—is dramatized through tactile choices (winding the box, arranging jars) rather than stated longing. No diagnostic label-speak; even epiphanies arise from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marek’s “logically emotional” contradiction is embodied through precise micro-choices—tuning breath to stone, offering the key—and his interiority avoids diagnostic labels. The seeker’s hunger shifts via physical listening (“shoulders and knees”), not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)

The girl’s arrival introduces a credible relationship crucible that deepens without sentimentality. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies toward teaching as resistance. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    The investigator’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—“watchfully calm” yet trembling, empirical yet haunted.

Final renunciation—carrying the lantern upward—is earned by prior causality and flaw (deference to control).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.3)
    Jonah’s internal conflict—between remorse and paralysis—is embodied through the clockwork heart metaphor and mirrored in the chaplain’s restrained agency. The chaplain’s micro-choices (carrying the box, refusing payment) reveal a hierarchy of values: repair over absolution, rhythm over redemption. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; emotions surface through tactile detail (brass filings, velvet lining) and subtextual dialogue. The final nod from Jonah conveys earned endurance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilex’s motivation—“to ring a bell no one hears yet”—is vividly embodied through micro-choices: adjusting the kaleidoscope, whispering to code, marking the hinge with chalk. His irreverent awe feels lived-in, not labeled, and his yearning is shown through tactile ritual rather than therapy-speak. The final tear-on-glove denial reveals layered emotion without over-explanation. His internal contradiction (skepticism vs. faith in longing) drives every action with consistent, character-specific logic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to find where deleted files go—is embodied in obsessive, tactile actions and micro-choices that escalate under pressure.

The final renunciation (choosing voice over silence) is earned by prior causality and carries visible professional risk. Contradictory impulses—duty vs. justice, caution vs. obsession—act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)

    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (suicidal intent vs. emergent care) act simultaneously in scene, not summarized.

The parasol tip and whistle aren’t props but extensions of flawed, evolving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sentinel’s interiority is vividly embodied—his quiet endurance, tactile memory of storms, and restrained empathy feel earned, not performed. The traveler’s contradictory impulses (love vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she “nods to the first and cannot to the second.” Their micro-choices—handing the pruning knife, writing on the map—reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through image and action (“map trembles like a net catching air”).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., guiding the walker, opening pages), and the half-masked walker’s “strangely honest” eyes and restrained gestures reveal a coherent, flawed individuality. Motivation—preserving echoes, not blare—is dramatized through action, not declaration. However, the prophet remains an abstract presence; his influence is felt but his character lacks on-page pressure or contradiction, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “perceptively calm” hands mask tremble to “give their nerves a rhythm to borrow.” Contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. emotional investment) act simultaneously, especially when she reveals the mirror layer. Micro-choices—asking for specific memories, assigning photos to arcs—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on communal witness over archival neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)

His motivation to decode growth’s pattern emerges not as exposition but through tactile engagement, and his final act of testifying without speech feels earned by every prior gesture. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak even at emotional peaks, grounding epiphanies in sensory detail (“dust becomes constellations of practiced neglect”). His contradiction—hating to speak yet loving to hear—is active throughout, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The junkyard prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness and tactile rituals (chalk, driftwood) manifest as embodied contradictions: he seeks future memory through present erasure. His micro-choices—circling statue mouths, resetting markers for his unknowing tomorrow-self—reveal a hierarchy of values where accompaniment outweighs retention. The interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through salt-counting breaths and wrist-bone listening. His final act of resetting the compass despite knowing it will be forgotten earns Charged Poise with palpable cost.

His tactile communion with instruments reveals a hierarchy of values where listening outweighs fixing. The final renunciation—unlearning the expectation of lunar silence—is earned through prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through sensor hums and thumb-weighted adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mr. Ramos and his son embody layered, contradictory impulses—abandonment and longing, silence and song—that culminate in a credible, earned reunion.

The final decision to “refuse to be impatient” feels earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: shadows only speak when loops are closed with care. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatlining mars peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—skepticism and forgiveness coexist in tactile choices like pocketing the tooth or setting Ari’s shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    The earthbound star watcher’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (longing vs. renunciation, memory vs. presence) act simultaneously in scene. Motivation (“share light without fire”) emerges from trauma and shapes every micro-choice, especially the tactile ritual of polishing. The brother’s absence functions as a crucible without flattening agency; the protagonist’s endurance forecloses fire’s return with visible cost (blackened beams, village’s wariness). Final renunciation—choosing patient glass over quick flame—is earned through consistent causality and sensory memory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—pulse, breath, pendant warmth—and their contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. self-protection) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation (“I kept what was mine…”) is earned through prior micro-choices (mapping the floor, sitting in silence) and carries visible relational cost. Voice distinction in dialogue is subtle but effective; her clipped grammar contrasts his lyrical restraint without convergence. Flaws are consistent and consequential—his passivity earlier enables her betrayal, and now shapes his quiet agency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowen’s motivation to restore sacred practices is consistent and embodied through tactile actions—tuning the tendril, teaching hums—but his interiority remains lightly sketched, relying more on archetype than contradiction. The narrator’s emotional arc (doubt softening, then vanishing) feels earned via sensory immersion rather than internal struggle. Flaws are implied but not dramatized as complicating forces; Rowen operates with near-uncanny competence. Still, micro-choices (kneeling to listen, coiling the tendril post-ritual) reveal a hierarchy of values aligned with care over control.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    The alchemist’s motivation—translating heartbeats into maps to guide others home—is rooted in grief for his sister and embodied through micro-choices: unsealing starlight sparingly, arranging objects with ritual care, softening his shoulders to “loosen the ribs of the orchard.” His patience isn’t passive but a physical discipline that forecloses haste, costing him time and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The locksmith’s motivation—rooted in his mentor’s belief and his desire to “store wonder”—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (tightening springs by echo-counts, machining gears). His peripheral focus isn’t just stated but enacted: he catches glints “sideways,” listens to “wrongness” in mechanisms, and harvests echoes with calibrated patience. The final renunciation—leaving the timer behind—is earned by his consistent ethos that “some keys should stay where they learn.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in brass prisms, water drips, and nested bells.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief as “wet wool,” fear as a “map I had refused to read”—and their micro-choices (orienting the body, cradling burdens) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The Fractal Weaver functions less as a person than a mythic catalyst, but this aligns with the story’s accumulative/textural lens. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; contradictions pulse in real time (“love that refuses to loosen even in thaw”). Final renunciation—carrying weights without apology—is earned through precise, tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)

The final renunciation (“absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness”) is earned by prior causality and resonates as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scavenger’s interiority is vividly embodied—regret as currency, ambition as sludge—and his contradictory impulses (to flee vs. stay, to bargain vs. admit) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)

Final endurance—sleeping on a bench after engineering mercy—is earned by consistent causality and carries the quiet cost of unpaid labor.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    The scribe’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradictions: his hunger for the city of bells wars with fear that he’ll “eat the music,” and his shame masks tenderness. His micro-choices—refusing to wind clocks, writing blank notations—are consistent with his introversion and deepen his renunciation. The final shift from avoidance to kinship with his dream feels earned, not epiphanic. Cost is visible in what he relinquishes (rebuilding) and what he accepts (weather-like coexistence).

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—understanding the city’s foundational lies—is embodied through precise actions (crate hook, rope winch, sundial) and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, quiet correction over revenge.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    The traveler’s motivation—to understand the geography of healing—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., using the thread, projecting presence) and contradicted by his own walled interiority.

Their intimate geometry yields credible emotional progression without therapy-speak. Both characters remain flawed, specific, and constrained by their circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prince’s interiority is richly embodied—his “quaking reverie,” tactile tenderness with the egg, and renunciation of conquest feel earned and contradictory. His micro-choices (scavenging harp wires, fasting, speaking only in lullabies) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The shift from lineage of conquest to caretaking is credible because it emerges through action, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—“softness can be structure and not surrender”—and micro-choices (rubbing the gear, triggering petal rain) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her struggle against generational trauma feels urgent, not abstract, and her renunciation of fire-as-solution is earned through repeated demonstrations of its harm. The child and captain serve as pressure points that crystallize her stance without diluting focus. Flaws are active, not decorative: her fear of being “an heirloom pretending to be alive” directly informs her method of teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)

His motivation—to decode intentions—is credibly rooted in loyalty to the widow, and his final act of planting poppies earns a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: he shoulders silence as steward of her secret.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    The copyist’s motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is embodied through meticulous, tactile actions (scattering ash, tapping pencil) that reveal a hierarchy of values: diligence as devotion, silence as scoreable material. Her internal contradiction—between preserving memory and enabling new articulation—is sustained without resolution, culminating in Earned Stasis: she accepts the role of hidden conductor. The cost is legible in her renunciation of visibility (“Nobody outside… would see my instrument”) and her sleepless vigilance (“Even sleeping, I kept time”). Cinder functions less as a character than a projection of the broadcast’s voice, but this ambiguity serves the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—“porcelain cracks in her eyes,” “memory sighs up as paper dust”—and contradictions pulse beneath every action: the need to expose versus protect, to scatter ash yet preserve memory.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her throat “bled” from shouting, now she “conducts unfinished chances”—and her micro-choices (placing the rosette, lifting hands for rests) reveal a hierarchy of values. Rafi and Ola’s wary dynamic functions as crucible without flattening into stereotype; their conflict carries generational weight yet remains specific to their glances and tones.

Flaws (e.g., past complicity in forgetting) aren’t safety-hedged but woven into the seed’s very nourishment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    The toll keeper’s involuntary truthfulness manifests in embodied choices—offering the matchbox, revealing the tray—that carry visible cost and foreclose paths (e.g., denying passage without wonder). Mara’s charcoal-ringed eyes and smoke-scented palms reveal her under pressure, and their dynamic crystallizes around reverence versus urgency. Interior contradiction thrums: candor isolates him yet defines his purpose; he climbs not from heroism but “stubborn desire to preserve wonder.” The final renunciation—returning to his desk—earns stasis through consistent motive and tactile micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Oris’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—stone knees stirring anemones, thoughts carried like current—and their motivation to “welcome nuance into a certainty” drives every micro-choice with visible cost. The scholar’s resistance creates genuine relational pressure, and Oris’s incisive kindness manifests as concrete action (threading the ampoule), not label-speak.

Her internal contradiction (yearning for connection yet working in solitude) pulses beneath every action without diagnostic self-awareness. The neighbor’s return crystallizes her arc not through epiphany but through mirrored behavior: he now paints too, proving her belief was not delusion but seed. Final blink—“dream awake”—is earned endurance with visible cost: years of sleepless nights transformed into communal language.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Curator’s interiority is richly embodied—fear of becoming an “embalmer,” salt-tongued hope, historical burden—and their micro-choices (baking initials, accepting the lens) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Senka functions as both pressure and mirror, her status clear in ritual gestures and object-handling. The protagonist’s flaw—historical orientation as both gift and curse—drives every decision without safety-hedging. Their final renunciation (“I promised to return seasonally”) forecloses permanent rescue but affirms cyclical care, earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to step beyond fate’s design—is embodied through specific, contradictory impulses: his “neatly inventive” hands yearn for control yet seek surrender, and his regret is tactile (“barnacles on my ribs”). His final renunciation of the alternate timeline in favor of the keeper feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost (abandoning his father’s stopped hour, lovers, and personal ambition). The keeper functions as a crucible, not just a presence—her call crystallizes his choice without melodrama. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are rendered through sensory detail and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear as a debt, existence as contingent on gaze—and their micro-choices (writing paradoxes, feeding the clasp into the lock) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The whispering advisor functions as both external force and psychological projection, avoiding flatness through voice distinction and ambiguous agency.

No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarization mars the crisis beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)

Interiority is concrete and voice-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. Zaya’s brief appearance functions as an extension of the protagonist’s method rather than a separate character arc, which fits the single-POV default. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but the earned stasis of weather becoming orchestra shows credible endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—quietly driven by maternal legacy and unanswered questions—is embodied in micro-choices (testing the whistle, stepping into glare) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction pulses beneath restraint: fear versus obligation, curiosity versus survival. Emotions are tactile (“light like a bell,” “pressure that bruises”) and never diagnostic. The final act of walking into measurement is earned by consistent character logic and carries irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s emotionally rational temperament is embodied through micro-choices—copying names, writing “Listen,” delivering the ledger—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interior contradiction (truth vs. mercy) acts simultaneously without therapy-speak. The grandfather’s legacy isn’t just backstory; it pressures present action via the key and the rose’s fall. Final renunciation of “easy righteousness” is earned by prior causality and tied to tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The surveyor’s interiority is vividly embodied—“boots remembering former thresholds,” “stoically sensitive”—and his micro-choices (wresting the latch, placing notes) reveal a hierarchy of values: witnessing over repairing. His motivation—to become an “archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is dramatized through tactile, costly acts, not declared. The final renunciation (“not to repair the past but to map its living gaps”) feels earned by every prior gesture, with emotional cost legible in the bioluminescent memory and unreturned fox bark.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ossa’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her “tranquilly perceptive” temperament manifests in embodied choices (e.g., waiting for the blackout to hear truth) and micro-decisions (hiding the stamp where it belongs). Her moral suspicion isn’t abstract but enacted through archival rigor, and her final act of concealment carries the cost of solitude. The contradiction between her desire for truth and the necessity of secrecy pulses beneath every action without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lantern maker’s grief is embodied with precise, contradictory physicality—“thin as a thread of smoke” yet capable of “thickening light”—and his micro-choices (polishing stones, folding steam-crane letters) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in loss. His motive—to guide his shadow home via origami cranes—is dramatized through tactile craft, not stated abstraction. The final renunciation (“It does not return to him, but it loosens”) earns Charged Poise with visible cost: the ache no longer drags at his ankles, yet the shadow remains absent. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, tool, and sensory ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (grief vs. vigilance, numbness vs. sensation) pulse through micro-choices like pressing the geode to glass or perturbing current “by a breath.” Motivation stems from trauma refracted through precise sensory memory (“long minute after the blast peeled my ears”), not exposition. The final renunciation—remaining awake, keeping “the measure open and unclean”—is earned by every prior beat of endurance. Flaws feel lived-in, not curated; the oracle-shrapnel both burdens and guides.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    The drone pilot’s interiority is richly embodied—sharp-eyed yet tender, calibrated for kindness by story’s end. Their motivation (“to decode the frequency of belonging”) intertwines with micro-choices (soldering a sextant cradle, adjusting algorithms to read silence) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The pilgrim’s wince-and-wind answer and trembling hand over blank paper deepen relational stakes without exposition. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their flaws (his noticing without finding, her exile from finished spaces) drive credible, costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s guilt and self-deception are embodied in tactile, contradictory impulses—e.g., “I told myself I am recording the heart, but the ledger aches with forgery”—and his final renunciation (“keep one page, so you remember what forgetting costs”) is earned through prior causality. Mara’s presence forces reckoning without melodrama; her quiet fury (“tempered regret, the same climate that lives in old photographs”) avoids caricature. Both characters act from consistent blind spots: his cowardice masked as protection, her need for truth over comfort. The micro-choice to burn the archives—and keep one page—carries visible moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s “uncommon thoughtfulness” manifests as embodied restraint and micro-choices under pressure—flinching before touching the boy, using the drawer pull as a tactile anchor—not as diagnostic self-awareness. Interior contradiction is present in the tension between neutrality and inherited peacemaking (grandmother’s legacy). Secondary characters apply immediate, legible pressure: Raglen’s scar-gnawing silence, Della’s urgent claim about the dying boy. The final renunciation of neutrality—offering grain, invoking shared history—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“jittery mouth,” “faith flickering in the pupils”—and his contradictory impulses (retreat vs. responsibility) act simultaneously when the boy appears. His micro-choice to guide them despite self-doubt feels earned, with visible cost in shame and effort. The “broken but working” line crystallizes a credible endurance that forecloses isolation without false redemption. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—forged in guilt, not evasion—is embodied through tactile choices (e.g., selecting doors by “regret softening,” holding the warming baseball). Interior contradiction pulses in every beat: seeking forgetfulness yet craving accountability. The final renunciation (“I chose to stay”) earns its weight through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests as physical sensation (“eyes watered as if guilt returned as steam”).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (steadiness vs. tidal grief), micro-choices (laying the slip, choosing “let me in”), and sensory memory cohere into a fully realized psyche. Mira’s practicality (“she asks the price”) grounds their dynamic without flattening her mystery. The final renunciation of plain speech feels earned through cumulative emotional and linguistic stakes. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through spice, breath, and bone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s guilt, maternal longing, and ritualistic devotion are embodied through precise sensory detail and micro-choices—pressing palms into cloth, offering a comb to the wind—that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her “willingly perplexed” stance isn’t stated but enacted, especially in her refusal to ask when she’ll fail again, only where to kneel. The internal contradiction between cartomantic control and maternal helplessness fuels every action without therapy-speak or abstraction. Her transformation is renunciatory (Earned Stasis): she accepts perpetual imperfection, and the cost—lost time made visible—is felt in suspended tick-motes and unsaid apologies.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s pacifism, grief, and gravitational embodiment form a coherent, contradictory interiority that drives micro-choices—smiling without fleeing, naming unused angers—that directly enable the climax. Their steadfastness isn’t passive but active renunciation, with visible cost in emotional labor and calibrated buoyancy. The final promise to “only unseal what could be tended” crystallizes a hierarchy of values rooted in prior struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through weight, breath, and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her shame over “accidentally” fulfilling prophecies, her renunciation of money/time/coincidence, and her quiet orchestration reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her micro-choices (placing bottles, asking others to listen with ribs) align precisely with her motivation to guide without spectacle. The child, fisherman, and volcanologist apply immediate, differentiated pressure that clarifies her stance without flattening her agency. Final renunciation—freeing the bugs, refusing myth—carries visible cost: anonymity in service.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—sparking a silent revolution through inherited craft—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., using the bronze quill holder to open locks) and rooted in maternal legacy. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, expressing tension through sensory detail (“corridor tastes of iron and rain”) and action. Fara and Rhun apply immediate, legible pressure that forces stance crystallization without flattening the protagonist’s agency. The final renunciation of spectacle for “hearth” feels earned, with visible cost implied in the shift from fear-based guarding to consent-based vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in a brother’s disappearance and a vow to decipher tidal grammar—is embodied through visceral, specific imagery (“promise burning in my ribs”) and culminates in a renunciation that accepts transformation as cost. The eel herder’s precognitive curse manifests not as exposition but as physical ache after each accurate gesture, revealing interior contradiction between knowledge and agency. Their final choice—to become a listener, not a rescuer—emerges from prior causality and carries visible emotional and existential weight. Both characters feel singular, their voices and worldviews inseparable from the story’s texture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear rarefied into clarity, hands steadying “furiously tranquil”—and their motivation (to map scars) drives every micro-choice. The revelation of the teacher’s identity reframes their past without over-explaining, and their final act of timing thunder carries emotional and thematic weight. Contradictory impulses—censorship versus expression, fear versus courage—coexist organically. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (greasy envelope, chrome button like a pulse).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—mechanical precision versus philosophical inquiry—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., using the needle card as both compass and weapon). Liese and Rook exert immediate, character-specific pressure that forces stance crystallization. The mechanical arm isn’t a gimmick; it shapes tactics and reveals limits under stress. Final renunciation (“a door cannot be fenced”) emerges from prior causality with visible cost: surrendering combat for entry.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vagrant poet’s molting identity and Lio’s quiet competence form a relationship crucible that compels tangible action—rebuilding the library—and each micro-choice (spilling pennies, opening the false bottom) reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in transience and resistance. Interior contradiction pulses through lines like “my current personality glow and crack,” embodying emotional complexity without diagnostic labels. The molting trait isn’t just stated; it constrains urgency (“before my next molting makes me a stranger to my own fire”) and charges every gesture with ephemerality. Final renunciation—trusting the next self to find the tin—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The pianist’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile metaphors (“keys stitched from postcard ivory,” “compasses whose needles flickered”) and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values—defying timetables to honor emotional truth. His motivation (“to surprise fate with an unplanned encore”) intensifies into high-stakes improvisation, culminating in a renunciation of mechanical time that carries visible cost: the station’s pause, the delayed train, the broken clock left behind. No diagnostic label-speak mars his emotional arc; longing remains steely, not sentimental. The final smile at the broken clock earns Charged Poise through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—doubt “glowed like a lighthouse,” emotions manifest through tactile interaction with seed, conch, and soil. Iru’s presence creates a crucible: their shared dream-memory forces a joint act of faith that reconfigures both characters’ roles. The final choice—to plant the seed—is earned by escalating doubt, testimony, and luminous uncertainty, with clear cost: surrendering control to the island’s listening ear. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (rigor vs. whimsy, empiricism vs. myth) drive every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (discipline vs. regret, silence vs. speech) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. Micro-choices (tracing lace, laying compass on rock) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the loss of the one who mattered, the abandonment of forced bonsai aesthetics. The final renunciation—pruning only what asks—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional weight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through tactile, precise perception.
