    The pianist's motivation to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" drives consistent action through the arbor journey, and his strategic creativity manifests in how he navigates the flickering compasses and improvises at the arbor stage.

However, internal contradiction remains mostly stated rather than embodied in simultaneous impulses, and the emotional progression through the surreal journey lacks concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's empirically whimsical methodology creates a distinct voice with concrete contradictions (rigorous fairy tale, cataloging waves while asking crabs for sources).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to find "the color of unspoken apologies" drives consistent action through embodied gestures (tracing lace, following compass).

The final choice—translating silence into music as a practice of staying—is earned by prior causality (the capsized ferry, the failed first attempt) with visible cost (the blistered lilies). Contradictory impulses act in scene: the need to translate silence battles the risk of misreading sadness.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through lines like "I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid."

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)

    Character motivation is clear and rooted in a unique occupation, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation ("We did not cheer") is an Earned Stasis foreclosing a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The debunker's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire for tangible truth over myth.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marek’s characterization is superb, with his "logically emotional" trait driving his unique tactical choice of sonic absolution over force. His final choice to offer the key is earned by his established method and her revealed backstory, creating a resonant reconfiguration. The seeker’s shift is equally well-motivated, her hunger "shift[ing] shape" through the stone's sound, not authorial fiat. A hairline deduction for a slight summary feel in her village's history, but the embodied micro-choices under pressure are flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)

    Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("a watchful dreamer by practice, not by choice").

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rowen is vividly characterized through concrete actions ("spun his tiny wrench," "kneeled, pressed his ear to the roots"), but the first-person POV character lacks interior contradiction or embodied emotion, serving more as a witness.

His motivation to "store wonder" is dramatized through his meticulous actions, and his final choice to leave the timer behind is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with a quiet, felt cost. A minor deduction for a slight abstraction in his core desire, which is more told than shown in a single line.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, complex trait (orchestrating coincidences as philanthropy). Her internal conflict is shown through the "old prickle of embarrassment" at fulfilling prophecies, revealing a fear of vanity that complicates her actions. The final choice to free the bugs and seek understanding feels earned by her established need for texture over spectacle. A slight deduction for the prophecy element feeling slightly convenient rather than a fully dramatized flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait ("calmly inventive") and a maternal legacy. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the quill holder to quiet the locks, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance ("guarding consent instead of fear") is an Earned Stasis with a visible cost, though the transition with Captain Rhun feels slightly swift, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist's motivation (lingering promise, debt to brother) is clear, concrete, and intensifies to compel the high-stakes choice to become a listener. The eel herder's precognitive curse is a compelling, character-particular flaw that visibly constrains her actions with cost ("the ache that followed every accuracy"). The final choice to continue her work is an Earned Stasis, a credible endurance foreclosing a path with felt cost, motivated by the prior causality of the rescue and her sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("thinning fear into a clarity that did not soften its edge"). The final choice to "measure how long their courage would echo" is earned by prior causality and the alignment of personal and civic scars, with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is precise and embodied, with the mechanical arm and philosophical stance informing micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to step into the gate is earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in the acceptance of departure. Liese's diplomatic fierceness and Rook's logical aggression provide legible secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vagrant's molting identity is a potent, character-specific trait that informs their urgency ("before my next molting makes me a stranger to my own fire"). Micro-choices like handing out pennies and reading aloud reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The core motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" is dramatized through concrete action, though the internal contradiction between their fleeting self and enduring mission could be more actively at war in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("steely longing," "hands that did not shake"). The pianist's motivation intensifies credibly from observation to active defiance, culminating in a wager against fate.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—renouncing spectacle for patient repair—is clear and continuously embodied in micro-choices (sweeping slowly, pinning plastic, tracing dust spirals). Her scientific reflex shapes tactics and interiority without therapy‑speak. The former penchant for “flamboyant fireworks” vs. present humility gives credible internal tension. The cost is modest but felt: she forecloses dramatic shortcuts for a laborious, unglamorous method.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clean and pressure-shaped: find who tried to kill her and decide what to do with the ledger. The internal conflict is on the page—guild justice vs. destruction—resolved by the annealed “midpoint” choice with visible conceptual cost. Embodied perception (sand chilling bones, rod singing) reveals psyche under stress. If anything, the rival remains off-stage, trimming relational crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (“translate silence into music”) drives concrete choices—building the system, aligning forks, conducting—and the refusal to elegize the sunk choir adds contradiction and cost. Embodied detail (“language of wrists,” weighting forks with leaves) keeps emotion particular rather than labeled. The endurance at the end (“permission to continue”) reads as Earned Stasis. Minor lack: the internal struggle in the present beat is understated, largely offloaded to prior attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear, specific interiority (“measure days by the weight of names”) and a consistent motive (to give rest an address) drive concrete micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses surface credibly—fear versus duty—without therapy-speak, and the manual’s warning tests resolve. Actions align with traits; “inadvertently stubborn” is dramatized by continuing despite miscall risk. The closing endurance (keeping to “arranging shards”) feels like earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The choral “we” is vivid and embodied through concrete micro‑choices, with Mara’s motives legible in action (one ring, night book, pairing teens with elders). The patrol scene reveals her values under pressure, protecting anonymity with cost. Contradictory impulses surface credibly (youths’ fear/pride; elders’ fear of raids). Interior specificity is conveyed through sensory and task detail rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, compelling motive (“to find where unused love is stored”) drives concrete, character-specific tactics. The internal contradiction between the mirror-maker who hoarded light and the present self seeking release plays on the page through breath and the camera’s shifting image. Emotions are embodied (heat surfacing with the tear; “storage closet unlatch behind my ribs”). Change is earned and forecloses a path of hoarding with a felt cost of decanting rather than drowning.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is concrete (“to discover the texture of time”) and compounds under grief and guilt from the burned library; pressing the shard, following the submerged bridge, and accepting the cost are credible micro‑choices. Contradictory impulses (“give grief exits” vs. being trapped by memory) act simultaneously on the page. Embodied, character‑particular perceptions (hedge designer’s angle/counting lexicon) keep emotion specific. The final acceptance reads earned rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motive (“to plant resilience in dry soil”) is embodied through tactical choices (decoding, jamming, bundling seeds with her chain). The “chained liberator” paradox gives her depth, though inner contradiction is more thematic than dramatized conflict. Secondary pressure from enforcers is clear but not relationship‑driven. The endurance/cost—remaining bound to a vow amid danger—reads credibly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—find the sound of trust breaking—rooted in a specific wound (“a partner signed my patents away”). Interiority is particular and embodied through tools (coil, bowl) and methods (collecting absences). The shift from chasing rupture to imprinting the prelude reads as an earned renunciation with cost. Slight remove in moments of lyric abstraction keeps us from seeing sharper contradictory impulses under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s desire “to press your ear against destiny’s door” drives concrete choices: decoding the bouquet, cracking the jar, picking the lock, and choosing to “return” light. Interiority is specific and embodied through professional perception (flowers, light, stations). The internal contradiction—thief vs. giver—resolves credibly at the end with a cost of self‑redefinition. Slight softness remains around visible sacrifice beyond the conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s motive—to forge “safe zones for inquiry” from an abandoned site—is clear and embodied through specific, tactile choices (salvaging shards, warming a kiln, placing vessels). His habit of narrating tasks reveals temperament and coping, not quirk. The internal conflict (“old fear that science and tenderness could not share a bench”) culminates in a credible renunciation. Cost is modest but legible (fatigue, scarcity, and a principled commitment that forecloses retreat).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (breath counts, fear as lever), with contradictory impulses—resentment and yearning—coexisting under pressure. The protagonist’s micro-choices (staying, decrypting, climbing, answering without armor) align with motive and escalate credibly. The brother’s quick acceptance and apology feel a touch tidy, slightly softening the complexity of betrayal. Nonetheless, the final renunciation/plan shows earned change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Two distinct, legible motives drive the scene: the oracle’s compulsion to “write quiet” and the courier’s conflict between orders and doubt. The courier’s on‑page turn (from scoffing to carrying the booklet) is earned through the listening ritual. Interiority is embedded in sensory action rather than labels, though the oracle’s interior contradictions remain largely idealized, not thorny. The visible cost (her bleeding fingers, her staying) grounds the endurance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied through task and texture: “hesitation leaves streaks,” the broom/violin choices, and the acceptance of practice over revelation. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity; composure vs. streaks) operate simultaneously on the page. Micro‑choices (setting broom aside, lifting the bow, returning it) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—accepting no grand revelation—reads as earned endurance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear from the outset—“to thaw mistrust with transparency”—and evolves into a risky, public confession that costs social capital and status. Contradictory impulses (keeper of ledgers/hush vs. hoarder of the lens/cowardice) act simultaneously and drive the decisive choice. Embodied moments (“my heartbeat is a drum in my wrists,” the lens “glows in my palm”) ground emotion. The closing renunciation (admitting fault, inviting judgment) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he wants proof the garden knows him—and his choices (rituals, planting the marble, confession, trimming, leaving the gate unlatched) align under pressure. Contradictory impulses—pragmatic superstition vs. honesty—collide at the fountain. Embodied emotion lives in tactile actions (polishing, kneeling, offering soil). The change reads as Earned Stasis: he accepts cost (admitting the lie, accepting wither) to recalibrate the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Jae’s motives (care for the mantas and a stubborn need to prove sideways time) drive every choice, from pulling the lever to setting markers afterward. His competence and gentleness cohere into a credible, particular interiority (“listening without shiver,” “icy warmth”). Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal—he rarely wavers under pressure—yet the quiet concealment of his own delayed selves suggests an earned, private cost. The final acceptance of proof “as an affection, not a test” lands as a measured evolution rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (unravel the ghost’s code) meets embodied fear/curiosity, with micro‑choices that reveal values (following reflection maps; stepping only on glints). The internal contradiction—reverence for silence vs. the need to act—animates the baton‑raising moment. The acceptance of the “conductor of silence” role reads as earned and specific. Slight limit: the musician’s prior flaw set is implied more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystal—she seeks to “weigh” a swallowed lie—and her contradictory impulses (protection via concealment vs. the bodily cost of carrying it) act in scene. Embodied micro‑choices—reaching toward the gentian, widening stance, starting confession at the margins—reveal a hierarchy of values. The oracle functions as a precise pressure source without flattening the protagonist’s interiority. The final renunciation (speaking the truth) is earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—he comes to weigh a “swallowed truth”—and the hand/steel bias governs micro-choices (lifting, counting threads, reopening). Contradictory impulses surface (“religiously skeptical” yet chasing a ghost shift; “hands, disobedient, turned the wheel”). Embodied perception (“breath tasted of iron,” “palms intelligent”) grounds emotion. The renunciation at the end (forgiving the wheel, rejecting spectral consolation) forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific interiority and a credible ethos (“sworn to witness change without judgment”) guide micro‑choices like counting pleats and refusing to protest the mushroomed alphabet. The tension between loosened grip on reality and the oath is present but not deeply dramatized in a single pressured beat. Embodied moments (mortar seasoning tea, finger tracing tunnels) keep emotions grounded. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rich, embodied interiority and micro‑choices (matching Ada’s tapping, asking to hold the locket, setting it on the guitar) reveal a distinct, competent but vulnerable narrator; Ada is spare yet deeply particular. The relationship functions as a crucible with palpable risk in opening and sharing the locket. The arc lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—Ada’s grief remains but is reconfigured, with a credible felt cost. Slight safety in uniformly sensitive responses keeps it shy of a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The historian’s motive—collecting what walls have heard before silence erases it—is clear and drives tactile choices (probing the flue, stitching the fragment into his logbook, shelving along the new pull). Interiority is particular and embodied (“porous… like wind through an unlatched gate”). While contradiction is understated, the porousness versus solitude tension registers as an earned renunciation when he “volunteers” to absorb stranded stories. The visible cost is quiet but present in his acceptance of burden and reorientation of his space.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear—“transpose life into a new key”—and choices align (taking the specs to the lighthouse, choosing “You already know”). Interiority is distinct and embodied (“hands sticky with sugar and salt”). The keeper dynamic adds light pressure and textured status play without stealing focus. Cost is subtler than harrowing, but the social reconfiguration and risk of exposure register credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Father Ilario’s motivation and tactics are sharply defined, and Mara’s conflicted consent emerges through the “contract” with grief. Interiority is mostly externalized via image and device rather than body-led feeling, but key micro-choices (asking permission; Mara standing; the husband’s hand) reveal values under pressure. The husband functions as secondary pressure without diluting focus. The final renunciation feels earned by the prior rhetorical probing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and particular: the “cryptic fortune cookie writer” makes micro-choices (laying out “instruments,” mapping memories, lowering voice, refusing words) that reveal values under pressure. Motivation coheres (to conduct unheard symphonies without frightening silence) and complicates behavior credibly. Contradictory impulses—longing for sound vs. guarding silence—operate simultaneously. Slightly abstract embodiment keeps it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority with embodied, character‑specific perception (“let my muscles forget their covenant with the ground”). The contradiction—urge to defy gravity vs. the need to surrender—plays out in concrete micro‑choices (hovering a finger’s width, then lowering). Motivation is coherent (“retrace what I kept losing,” “labyrinth of self”) and culminates in an earned renunciation. Slight abstraction at times keeps some emotion at a remove, but the final choice reads credibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s goal (to thaw numbness) is clear and embodied through tactile perception and micro‑choices (bringing the reverse‑player, consenting to Oko’s method, stitching the filament). Her interiority feels specific (skin, bones, remembering of feet) rather than labeled. The internal contradiction—competent teacher fearing deadened feeling—registers but never truly strains her tactics, making the arc feel slightly tidy. The closing acceptance costs her comfort in forward motion, but the price is subtle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and idiosyncratic (“pressure fell not forward, but sideways”), with contradictory impulses—serenity versus threat—held simultaneously. Choices arise from character: decoys, coded isobars to the archivist, and the lateral exit. The on‑page endurance/renunciation is credible: refusing confrontation to protect integrity at felt risk. Dialogue with the wet‑hem figure sharpens status and motive without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, compelling motivation (to understand scent-triggered grief) drives concrete choices: bringing the UV lantern, opening the vial despite dread, and staying through the flower’s unveiling. Contradictory impulses—aromatic caution vs. hunger for meaning—act simultaneously in scene. Emotional embodiment lands (the “buckles me to the floor” memory; tears archived), and the final reorientation (vial as compass) feels earned. Minor risk of lyrical summarization, but it’s anchored by tactile actions and costs.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is precise (“discover the texture of time”) and enacted through concrete micro-choices (snuffing the lantern, looping the rope, asking to be shown “how time bruises”). Interiority is idiosyncratic and embodied (rope as “grammar,” silt tasting), with a credible contradiction between mischief and mercy. The renunciation—braiding past into present rather than cutting it away—reads earned and costly. The energy being’s silent pressure sharpens the narrator’s stance without displacing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—“to unbind the silence” and find beauty in the unfinished—is clear, embodied through choices (playing incomplete songs, gathering objects, deciding to tend “halves and almosts”). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (the ear trained by breakwaters; rosin drawing voice from maple). There’s limited internal contradiction, but the gentle acceptance of cost (abandoning bonfire tradition, taking on “gentle obligations”) reads as an earned endurance rather than a neat epiphany. Dialogue with Lark sharpens values without flattening them.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct, embodied interiority: a dealer who sells “counterfeit emotions” yet cares, negotiating affection vs detachment. Micro-choices (asking why though already knowing; letting Rhea take the petal; charging little; writing nothing) track motivation under pressure. Rhea’s motive is specific and credible, and their status/knowledge dynamic stays legible. The change lands as earned restraint rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motive—uplifting the unnamed dock workers—drives concrete choices (starting the Ledger, forgiving demurrage, planning discounts) and she risks social capital by publishing quiet names. Her “cautious exuberance” threads through action rather than label alone, and Jun’s counter‑texture complements her. Interiority is lyric rather than deep psychological torque, so the internal contradiction (risk vs recognition) is felt but not combatively dramatized. The closing key‑handoff is a credible renunciation of sole custodianship with a mild but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑specific motive (“graft myself onto community”) drives concrete choices (ear sculpture reply, pact with Farrin, marking whispers, embedding shards). Interiority is textured and embodied through work and “luminescent ache,” with a credible endurance at the end. The flaw “boldly sympathetic” constrains tactics and exacts cost (tenderized, ongoing ache). Internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharp, but sufficient for this quiet arc.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation (“find the place where echoes are born”) is precise and animates micro‑choices: tracking cadence, borrowing seconds, widening the oval, then choosing to release rather than trap. Interiority is embodied (cold pendant, hand shaking) and character‑particular (observer’s ethics vs. intervention). The renunciation—uncaging and then sealing the oval despite debt—reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost. Minor note: internal contradiction is present but could sharpen once more under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise—he seeks coherence rather than reunion—and his actions (arranging fruit, speaking names, threading the rope through the eyes) reveal a character who solves grief through craft. Contradictory impulses are present: secrecy versus the desire to “understand the mathematics of emotion.” The final stance—carrying an unsolved theorem—reads as earned endurance with cost. Interiority remains concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, particular interiority: his vow “to become visible to those who need you” conflicts with fear of exposure, producing micro‑choices (guiding the girl vs. staying hidden). Embodied methods (felt pads, chalk routes, caches) reveal a meticulous, gentle temperament under pressure. The renunciation at the end—crafting visibility through traces rather than stepping into sight—feels earned and costly. The girl is lightly sketched, but that suits the single‑POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—compulsion to arrange versus a learned practice of listening—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (tying knots that “sigh loose,” stepping aside at the jasmine–hop “treaty,” keeping a ledger of what she didn’t force). Embodied images anchor emotion (“droplets…like second thoughts,” the linden leaf crisping in her pocket). The external pressure of customers and weather tests her stance and elicits costly restraint. The final vow forecloses her old tactic with a believable price: relinquishing authority and speed for attentional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    The painter’s motives and contradictions are clear—insomnia, mistrust of water, hunger for meaning—and her choices (pocketing the brooch, agreeing to return it, prying open the resin) reveal character under pressure. The relationship with the keeper plays as a crucible that deepens, not dilutes, her drive. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“gulls threaded a cry through my ribs”). Slight softness: resistance is minimal, so change feels gentle rather than wrestled from conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motives (guide to deliver, village benefit; pilgrim to serve) meet an embodied contradiction when the narrator reaches to stop the pearl and loses “certainty.” The baker’s history (yeast, markets) particularizes him, and his choice to offer the pearl upward reveals values. The narrator’s renunciation is earned and costs status and self‑definition. Minor: the village stakes are evoked but not tested directly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist’s motives and micro-choices are precise and character-specific (asking for the ring-tap cadence, turning the valve, writing “tone: none,” gifting the valve). Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and occupational lens rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle—“reactively visionary” who nonetheless initiates a practice—but the personal cost to the narrator remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as risk. The relationship with the woman carries quiet pressure without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is legible from the first lines and intensifies as the “meticulous route mapper” must trade control for listening. Interiority is specific (maps, punch, arrows) and embodied in micro‑choices: aligning arrows to heartbeat, punching “fear and habit,” folding maps until borders dissolve. The contradiction—prizing spaces between lines yet held by patterns—drives the change. The renunciation at the mouth (“Unbutton them”) lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s “sympathetic skeptic” stance is enacted through concrete choices—offering tea but refusing ghosts, aligning the tile yet insisting on discipline, and finally risking vulnerability by naming personal losses. Contradictory impulses coexist on the page, especially in “disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs.” Lio’s presence sharpens the crucible, revealing a hierarchy of values (care and truth) under pressure. The visible cost is the narrator’s relinquishing of sterile detachment for a charged, shared room.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—an immortal refusing endings seeks the afterword of goodbye—and choices align (leaking the rumor, activating the fragment, paying memories). Interiority is specific and idiosyncratic, with concrete micro‑choices under pressure. The Lio dynamic adds pressure and a credible relational cost (“a face that had sworn not to forgive me”). Internal contradiction (refusing endings yet chasing post‑goodbye) is productive, though the emotional struggle remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motives are vivid and particular: the narrator’s hunger for a “fair trade” collides with a legacy of cons, producing concrete choices (ledger, refusal to lie, hand steady on Arman’s shoulder). Interiority is embodied and precise, not abstract. Micro-choices under pressure feel real and value-driven (theatre for the camera, timing the breach, taking evidence instead of money). The cost—risking legal and moral exposure—is felt without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    A singular, credible sensibility: the stationer’s patient craft and ethical stance (“a workable grammar for waiting”) root every action. Motivation is legible and sustained; micro‑choices (charting hums, refracting light, choosing endurance) align with traits. The main limitation is a near‑absence of contradictory impulses or friction that would expose deeper fault lines under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid—he’s a “survivor of my own erasure” seeking the “texture of memories”—and his tactics (collecting fragments, confronting the widow silently) align with that drive. Contradictory impulses surface: desire to reclaim vs. refusal to name or accuse, culminating in placing the label and leaving. Interiority is concrete (bitter taste, oily constellations) rather than diagnostic. The cost is an earned endurance: he relinquishes direct restoration of identity in favor of a charged, risky exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich interiority and concrete micro‑choices (tuning the peg “until the string tasted the wind,” thinking of failure to move the compass) reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche (“gloomy cheerfulness”). Motivation is clear and sustained, and the closing renunciation of certainty for kindness reads as an earned stance shift. Slight softness in on‑page cost keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Nessa’s motives are clear and intensify under pressure: protect the carnival’s memory while engaging the consortium. Contradictory impulses act in scene through the quiet war with her brother and the risky trade with the liaison. Micro‑choices—using the chip, stamping the pact, reorienting rafts—align with her “orderly intuitive” nature. The cost is felt: she buys only a season and exposes local grammar to outside power.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—arrive early to witness and prove the last glacier moth—and actions map cleanly to that aim (vials, camera, breath control). Interiority is specific and embodied, balancing professional rigor with filial tenderness (“a kept star from a vanished guild”). The contradiction—proof‑gathering versus anticipatory grieving—complicates the peak beats without neat resolution. The Earned Stasis at the end (witnessing without saving) carries a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, competent protagonist with tactile, sense-led tactics and a steady ethic of care; the “not panic but precision” pivot under fog pressure reveals character. Limited contradiction—calm rarely frays—keeps the interior arc modest, but micro-choices (more bowls, code tweak, pointing) are grounded and motivated. Relationship with Mirel is functional and supportive, adding gentle pressure without deflection. The cost is mostly cognitive and temporal rather than moral, but it reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and acted upon: the editor follows condensation, braves the culvert, opens the locker, and turns the valve. Interiority is particular (“not brave, but… subtly confident”), and the fear of taming the wild complicates the victory. Micro‑choices under pressure read specific and embodied. The earned endurance at the end—choosing to listen and let the stove speak—feels like a credible renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tuner’s motive—restoring shared balance—drives concrete choices (striking the fork, pacing routes, inviting townspeople, naming a “payment”). Interiority is conveyed through tactile, character‑specific noticing (“urgency played his ribs like strings”) rather than labels. The mother’s wariness and the children’s curiosity add relational texture without hijacking the POV. Slight limitation: conflict remains emblematic; the tuner’s contradictions (patience vs. urgency) rarely force a fraught trade beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific (save the sub by exploiting the temple’s acoustics) and the interiority is embodied and character‑particular. The contradictory impulse of panic vs. chosen stillness (“by overriding instinct”) recurs and meaningfully shapes tactics. Micro‑choices under pressure—unsnarling the line, where to place the transmitter, when to hold still—reveal values without speechifying. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with cost (time/air risk accepted).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is specific and sustained: he rows back to “chase hush” and control the story before discovery. Contradictory impulses—legacy of false alarms vs. a “truer bell”—are dramatized through tactile choices (pressing the lattice to the tube, setting it over the drain, planning measured answers). Emotional texture is embodied in sensory actions rather than labels. The renunciation of inherited lying for a costly, measured stance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, character‑particular motives (keeper lacks the “heart key,” promises not to “wake grief”) guide choices and foreclose paths (ignoring the trader; accepting loss as the ghost fades). Interiority is embodied through tactile, specific actions (threading the bead, pruning cadence as vow). Contradictory impulses—longing versus restraint—are dramatized rather than labeled. The final endurance (keeping her vow without her) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and tactile choices (“sew a long tether… dot every seventh knot with ink”) reveal a stubborn, ritual‑minded optimist. Motivation is consistent and embodied in action rather than label. The chief limitation is low visible struggle; she meets little internal contradiction under pressure once inside the labyrinth. Leaving the plate reads as a credible cost aligned with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is specific and embodied: “time hesitate like a held breath,” the tooth/coin/heel images, and the ache of “home as a rumor” all root motive in felt experience. Contradictory impulses—hired to document vs. yearning to restore faith—play simultaneously and drive micro‑choices (listening with feet, returning objects). The decisive acts (rebuilding the sundial; choosing to stay and tend) align with a deepening, not a flip. Cost is present as renunciation of departure and professional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (choose the right alias and delivery) with credible tension between urgency and the ethic of slowness. Embodied interiority in tactile acts (kneeling, grit on knees, pen as metronome) avoids abstraction. The internal contradiction—send vs wait; concealment vs truthful naming—culminates in an earned refusal to mail yet. The patient hold shows cost-bearing endurance rather than pat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular: she listens to stitch rumor into revelation. Contradictory impulses—jester’s mask vs. serious risk—operate in scene (“I disguise wisdom as foolishness…” and acceptance of blame). Micro‑choices (pricking her finger, loosening falsified routes, dousing the ash, asking for sleep) reveal values under pressure. The endurance choice at the end (to carry the stained rumor and keep watch) feels earned with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is concrete, self-implicating, and pressured by contradictory impulses (to leave before cruelty vs. to stay and listen). Micro-choices—anchoring, lowering the shard, asking for “that hour,” practicing stillness—align with a felt flaw (premature leaving). The final renunciation (“go home and not decide… share the hinge”) lands as earned stasis with cost. Shame and tenderness remain unresolved enough to feel honest, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and specific: a translator whose compulsion to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” governs tactful, embodied micro‑choices (turning the coral, starting with the boy’s boats). The relationship pressure with mother and uncle is delicately staged and alters their state by the end. Internal contradiction is quiet but present—balancing reverence for grief with the audacity to interpret a child’s cast into a bridge. The cost is emotional exposure and the risk of misstep in a fraught space, credibly borne.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and sustained (“I had come to rediscover lost joy”), and actions track: attempt the film, then cede authorship to the “knowledge network.” Interiority is textured (“pensive mirth”), with tactile attachments (the shard) that reveal values. Internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressured—more serenity than friction—so cost is more implied (sharing authorship) than felt. Still, micro‑choices under pressure (inviting correction; reversing the last frame) credibly reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is specific and embodied—using the hobo nickel as straightedge, oracle, bell—and contradictory impulses (faithful restoration vs. curiosity) act in scene. The confession “I admitted fear that a perfect restoration erases the hands that kept living” earns the later choice to let underdrawings whisper. Micro‑choices (tapping rhythms, rolling the coin, asking questions into the parabolas) reveal values under pressure. The change costs her certainty and strict fidelity while preserving story.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive—defiant protection of untaxed thought—drives every choice from founding the club to triggering the public “choir.” Interiority is vivid and object‑charged (the seed’s weight, sweat as “second language”), though internal contradiction is light; confidence outruns fear. Kline adds gentle counterpressure without crowding the POV. The final micro‑choice to stage the public rehearsal under threat reads earned and aligned with the established rogue‑scholar trait.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motives and contradictions are vivid: the insomniac curates darkness yet seeks an armistice, hesitating before breathing a vow. Micro‑choices (humming messages nightly, pressing sea blooms, finally consenting “in the damp, uncertain air”) reveal hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is consistent and particular to the poet’s sensorium (ink, salt, nacre). The cost—relinquishing “sharpness as safety” while still sleepless—reads as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied (a caretaker devoted to preserving forgotten names), with credible contradiction between “gently systematic” craft and a faltering heartbeat under pressure. The past failure (rain‑dial) and vow deepen stakes without speechifying. Micro‑choices (hum catalog numbers, stitch without piercing tone, test own name) reveal values. Slight limitation: high competence keeps risk perception modest on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (“restore trust after silence”) drives concrete tactics (composing, staging, inviting a test). Contradictory impulses (“carefully reckless”) play on the page via the stele memory and the risk of inviting Lio back into dialogue. Micro‑choices—placing pages where the archive “listens,” offering the quill—reveal values with cost (vulnerability, ownership of past harm). Slight softness: Lio’s quick move from brittle to collaborative faces limited resistance, keeping pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Singular, specific interiority (“machines are only honest when they are allowed to care”) and a live contradiction (market vs. ash) drive choices. The machinist’s micro‑decisions—refusing to name names, tuning to the catenary, pledging songs—align with motive and reveal values under pressure. Embodied beats (the tremble, ear to rock) keep emotion concrete. Slight ease—competence rarely falters—keeps it just shy of the most searing arc.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, embodied interiority ties fear to tactility (scale, skylight, beam), and contradictory impulses (guardedness vs. release) operate simultaneously. Micro‑choices under pressure—the thin slips, the recalibration with the chip, the decision to risk the choir—feel inevitable from prior wounds. The relationship with the violinist exerts real pressure though kept at a distance. The final loosening hinge is earned and paid for with risk rather than tidy self‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise (find/understand the father via “thresholds”), and the refusal to descend is an earned endurance with cost. Interiority is specific and embodied through grain, wind codes, and the terrace’s mechanics. The contradiction—longing vs. keeping distance—operates in-scene and culminates at the seam. Minor abstraction in a few thematic statements does not blunt the emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—“to learn the rhythm of belonging without pretending to be native”—and actions align (the shared exhale, the truthful answer to the algorithm). Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual rather than labels. The relationship with Rin adds pressure and capability without overshadowing the narrator. The cost is mostly conceptual (vulnerability and renunciation) rather than a sharp on‑page sacrifice, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct, embodied interiority with a credible professional ethos; the “cheerful gloom” contradiction animates choices. Motivation is clear (find why the path vanished), and micro‑choices (summoning the bird, rerouting with seeds) align with values. Internal conflict remains gentle—more courtesy than anguish—so cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, choices reveal a specific hierarchy: duty to travelers balanced with deference to the land.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    A precise, idiosyncratic interiority drives micro‑choices—planting a question in the janitor, instructing the girl, tilting the bishop—that reveal a mind trained to coax chance. The performer’s values (connection over applause) are dramatized, not told, with a credible endurance at the end. The janitor and girl apply gentle but present social pressure that sharpens the performer’s aims. The only limit is the low-intensity emotional risk; conflict remains finely calibrated rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—inscribing a resistant memory on skin—is clear, particular, and enacted through precise micro‑choices (observing gaps, dotting, charging negative space). Embodied emotion shows via “obsidian grace” and tide‑trained gesture rather than labels. The cartographer’s presence applies gentle, relevant pressure without stealing focus. Internal contradiction is muted (confidence outweighs risk), which trims peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, concrete, and profession-specific; his ethos (“mend light”) drives choices from the pond ritual to salvaging ferry boards. The boy’s question applies immediate human pressure that sharpens his values without tipping into didacticism. Contradictory pulls—spectacle/investor vs. communal care—coexist on the page and resolve to an earned stance. The visible cost is mostly conceptual (risking spectacle and timelines), but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is lucid and embodied; he’s driven to “translate pain” and the porcelain box concretizes that aim. Contradictory impulses—his refusal to forgive himself vs. his compulsion to return the saved figures—play at once. The relationship functions as crucible: her gaze to his hands and the shared opening are pressure tests with cost. The final renunciation (“less a debt, more a pathway”) reads earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (“recalibrate our days”) informs concrete tactics, and the narrator’s competence feels earned through tool use and ritual. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers under pressure, so change reads as refinement rather than contested transformation. Embodied emotion lands via tactile details (salt, tide, torchlight) rather than labels. The final stance (teaching the village) is credible but pays only a subtle cost (relinquishing solitude/control), not a sharply felt one.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑POV interiority is rich and particular: a vow‑driven listener whose micro‑choices (follow ivy, warm the negative, hop through hopscotch, read the letter aloud, bind the strip) reveal values under pressure. The central contradiction—beautifying vs bearing legacy’s weight—surfaces in “map it faithfully or shirk the weight with pretty symbols.” Embodied cost registers (“my name slid away like a coin down a tide drain,” the shawl of burden). The arc lands as an earned acceptance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crisp and sustained: to convince mirrors to show possibility rather than hospital-taught defeat. Interiority is embodied and particular (the borrowed heartbeat “eager…to outgrow me”); contradictory impulses (desperation braided with discipline) operate in scene. Micro‑choices—following the prism parapet, matching breath to the rafters’ drip, singing specific “stay/if/unless”—reveal values under pressure. The renunciation of command (asking rather than ordering the glass) lands as a credible, costly stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    The negotiator’s motives and method are consistent and embodied (“operatively gentle,” letting the wind ride the argument, inviting children) with credible micro‑choices under pressure. Dialogue stages moral calculus (“redemption without penalty… penalty without horizon…”) that the narrator reframes into actionable work. Internal contradiction is mild (resolve versus doubt) but present as weariness and patience-as-armor. Secondary figures (old soldier, general) apply live pressure and reveal character through response.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory impulses (amoral financier vs. hoarder of echoes) act simultaneously and drive micro‑choices: he funds drought yet kneels to “release” an egg as a bell. Interiority is precise and embodied (salt cutting boots, spine slackening). The final renunciation—letting the egg turn to powder to preserve only echo—feels earned and costly. No hedging of his moral stain, which deepens rather than softens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Her motive—defying the palace’s lullaby—drives every micro‑choice, from kneeling to rethreading the looms, with embodied restraint (“bodily poetic”) shaping her tactics. Interiority is implied through sensory focus rather than explained, avoiding therapy‑speak. The main limitation is minimal contradictory impulse on the page; she rarely wavers, so the cost reads as risk rather than an internal struggle. Still, her disciplined chastity reframed as power adds character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is specific and ethically fraught; the narrator’s self‑indictment (“ethics I had not yet earned”) and micro‑choices (setting down the stick, stopping mid‑drawing) reveal a real conflict. The arrival of the woman forces a status reconfiguration and an immediate on‑page adjustment of the plan. The final renunciation (inviting subjects to cut scenes; no applause) reads earned and carries cost. A slight blur around Sorin versus the narrating calligrapher keeps the secondary relationship underused.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—an “esoteric realist” seeking witness through nonverbal signals—and actions align: silence, knots, patterns, and final weighting with resin. Contradiction (skeptical of fantasy yet asking for witness) generates tension without breaking plausibility. Micro‑choices under pressure (not speaking, arranging the heartbeat, pausing for the hawk) reveal values. The cost is quiet but present: renouncing permanence and speech in favor of fragile, time‑bound gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—atonement through craft—and the “technically gentle” self‑description governs micro‑choices with the rope and wax. The grandmother’s bell mistake anchors credible guilt and cost. Contradictory impulses (shame vs. calling) operate in scene without therapy‑speak. The final endurance choice (“stay, cast, listen”) reads earned and forecloses flight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority (“names are maps…mine is a maze”) and motivation shape concrete micro‑choices: breaking the wafer, feeding dream‑translations, and finally opening the door. The internal friction between algorithmic duty and chosen invitation is dramatized, not merely stated. Bodily/sensory anchoring under pressure (“bunker becomes a lung…”) keeps emotion embodied. The renunciation of captivity carries a felt cost as she steps into the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s frugality, skepticism, and reverence create a credible contradiction that tightens into a vow. Choices on the page—aligning wires, pouring water, pressing the bead, pledging maintenance—flow from those traits. Embodied detail (“the air hummed against my teeth,” “pepper and rain”) grounds interiority. Cost is explicit: oil, hours, and a renunciation of spectacle for stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s “scheming pacifist” motive is specific and consistent, and Rell’s embodied resentment (jaw, spine, prickles) gives concrete pressure. Micro‑choices—touching the neck, co‑opening the lid, kneeling to return “unspent years,” accepting the box—track a credible shift. The cost (relinquishing resentment and the defenses built on it) is felt, though the turn glides a bit smoothly. Still, the change reads earned under this fable‑lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivations are clear (save the district by “capturing” the dream) and evolve credibly into care over control. Interiority is specific to Ilen’s craft (“worker of surfaces”) with embodied action guiding emotion. The relationship pressure is live—Noor’s falter (“breath shook”) creates a crucible where Ilen adapts. The change lands as earned endurance/care rather than triumphal trap.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s vocation and flaw (“good with cracked timbers… bad with goodbyes”) drive choices, with the renunciation of opening the tin reading as a credible cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (quartz eye, craft praxis) and actions align with motives. The relationship with Mira applies gentle, relevant pressure that modulates tactics (psalter reading, shove, shared work). The final endurance—waiting for the daughter—feels earned and forecloses an easier, self‑soothing path.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear (pursue forbidden knowledge; honor the vanished aunt) and acts under pressure against fear of being “rewritten.” Embodied beats—shaking hands, the cameo burning—ground interiority. The key choice (pressing the cameo, then eating the dull fruit) earns the closing stance shift. A touch more contradiction at the moment of biting could heighten felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistently pursued, with concrete micro‑choices (declining the lamplighter’s offer, promising the apprentice, using “conjugations like ladders”) revealing values under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied by a singular sensibility (“catalog holes,” “corridors skipping echoes”). Internal contradiction is subtle—rule‑breaking caretaker vs. reverent listener—but doesn’t fully torque into a sharp dilemma. The closing stance (rescue missions turned inward) feels earned and forecloses tidy perfectionism at a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear (to find the garden) and the internal contradiction—discoverer vs. person—acts in scene. Embodied texture (“trapped freedom thrummed in my ribs,” the cold jar) grounds the abstraction. The decisive renunciation (“unclasped… one hand letting go of the ledger”) credibly forecloses a path. Slight remove from concrete bodily beats in midsection keeps it shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“translate confusion into clarity”) drives concrete micro-choices: knot‑reading, cadence‑counting, refusing to step fully into the stairwell. The interior conflict—order versus the seduction of mystery—is legible without therapy‑speak. The solution comes a touch too smoothly, with limited visible strain or error under pressure. Still, the closing renunciation (omitting the door in his note) reads as an earned, character‑specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: protect maps and make space for coexistence. The narrator’s fear (“ribs clatter”) coexists with practiced calm (“pretended confidence”), giving credible contradiction. Micro‑choices—reading ice, selecting the corridor, aligning and tapping the stone—reveal craft under pressure. The change is an earned endurance: he accepts ongoing tending rather than a cure‑all.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive: the custodian seeks both to save wanderers and to “prove that coincidences have meaning.” Micro‑choices under pressure (trading water for the map, trimming and seating the shard, aligning mirrors) reveal values. Internal tension—skepticism vs faith in coincidence—stays subtle but present, not contrived. Emotional embodiment lands in tactile beats (listening to the shard’s “mute cries” with wrists).

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rich, specific interiority—“binder not a page” versus the hunger to “bleed ink”—drives a credible, risky shift to offer a personal memory. Contradictory impulses act on the page (custodian of others vs. self-assertion). The choice to speak the plum memory arises from prior pressures and lands with a felt cost. Emotional texture is embodied via tools (quill) and ritual (shadows), not labels.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and active—arrive to “defy the gravity of hopelessness” by teaching light to “play seriously.” Interiority filters through a precise professional lens (filtering fuel, mapping wind), and micro‑choices abound (following the mosaic note, choosing placements). The Lark relationship adds a crucible for decision and a pact that reframes action. Slight softness: minimal internal contradiction or visible personal cost beyond labor and risk keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation and inner conflict are vivid and particular: love vs vocation, patience vs urgency, embodied through the cicada’s weight and the grotto’s hush. The narrator’s “warmly observant” impulse both steadies and endangers the moment (you “perhaps felt abandoned”), showing real trade‑offs. The decision to go inland is earned by the prior weighing of futures and the method of circling truth. Slight safety in the partner’s quiet limits complicating status shifts, but the relationship pressure still reads.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is vivid and particular (greedy to “collect the flavors of different silences”) and drives concrete choices: climb during the inversion, limit exposure, and ask the father to “taste.” Contradictory impulses are live (“made of exits” yet tempted by too much hush). The final shift—inviting the father into her pursuit and agreeing to redraw entrances—feels earned with a modest but felt cost. Minor note: the father’s interior remains off‑stage, but his on‑page reaction credibly pressures her.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivations are clear and embodied: the operator’s vocation (“teach silence how to comfort”) drives precise micro-choices (dimming light, opening windows, slowing drift). The mathematician’s “fluidly logical” nature shows in her questions and habitual computing, with a credible soft reversal when she stops calculating. Interiority is specific and textured without therapy‑speak; the singer memory injects cost and prevents tidy uplift. Slightly limited by the relative gentleness of conflict, but the earned relaxation reads as a meaningful reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear (find the stair, prevent a century of silence) and refracts through a bookish, caretaking temperament; the “ache of libraries” vs. “crown hunger” is a crisp internal conflict. Micro-choices—using the ruby, warming and peeling the wall, choosing to leave the throne unbound—align with that ethos. Quin functions as a foil (doubt vs. bravery) and joins the final choice without stealing POV. The cost is chosen restraint rather than triumph, credible for this character.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motive—to steward pain and teach breathing to what suffocates—is consistent and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (lifting the ring, denying the girl’s wish to vanish, stepping aside). Contradictory impulses (“burns bridges carefully” vs. returning to keep watch) complicate her stance credibly. Emotions are conveyed through tactile images (scars waking, cold ring) rather than labels. Slight abstraction at times keeps us a half‑step from visceral heat, but not enough to blunt credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation and contradiction are vivid: a pyramid-scheme survivor who craves value yet fears predation, choosing risk when “let the vow cut you” arrives. Micro-choices under pressure—turning the chamber, seating the bolt, signing her name—align with her stated aims. Embodied perception (“IOU scars that itch”) grounds feeling in action. The final acceptance of responsibility reads earned and forecloses the safety of blame.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is specific and embodied—tea‑like shadows, lacquer scent, the crank’s knurling—tying motive (uncover truth) to tactile choices. Contradictory impulses (shame, duty, grief, and relief) act simultaneously at the key beats. Agency is clear: she sets the machine, reads the ledgers, interprets the ash, leaves her seal, and renounces rebuilding. Slight softness: the external counterpressure is minimal and the revelation meets little resistance beyond her internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: he seeks “the shape of possibility” and renounces the old vow. Interiority is specific (visor unsnapped, gorget clasps, breath, shivering bliss) and the mother’s program personalizes the stake. Contradictory impulses (trained for thunder vs murmured allegiance) act in scene. The final choice—pressing the kernel to his tongue—feels earned and carries the cost of foreclosing other possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—“broken‑hearted” yet “tactfully hopeful”—play out in micro‑choices: pulling the box, reading the dust, amending the record, and making the envelope. Emotions are embodied through tactile noticing (dust crescents matching finger habits, the “talc‑gray air”). The choice to add an addendum and not resolve the address is an Earned Stasis with cost. No stock psychology; the archivist’s lens is specific and lived‑in.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is crystalline and enacted through concrete choices (key, hinge, code), with embodied perception (“penny metal and rain on paper”) grounding emotion. The quiet-clerk/underestimated-rebel tension reads as a lived contradiction rather than a label. The only limitation is the relative ease of her operation—little on‑page resistance to test her limits. Still, the final renunciation—remaining the hinge rather than the hero—lands as an earned stance with implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and particular: an oath-bound musician preventing a prophecy’s completion. Interiority is embodied through breath, embouchure, and the sax as “amulet against remembering,” with the teacher-memory adding contradiction (duty vs. grief). Micro‑choices under pressure—register shifts, feathered breath, whisper placement—reveal values. The cost is endurance and isolation, felt in the final “absence I have made” and the oath that “holds.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV interiority is vivid and particular, with tactile micro-choices (delaying the reach; tray placement) revealing a careful, ritual-driven temperament. The shift from interpreting leaves to “building new monuments from seeds” reads as an earned stance change. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatic (competence vs. restraint), so pressure on a deeper flaw remains light. Still, actions align cleanly with motive and culminate in a credible reorientation of role.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and intensifies: grief-tinged precision gives way to risk and adaptive curiosity. The “uncertainly certain” stance functions as live ambivalence at key beats (choosing to step through the falls, assembling a clock of water). Micro-choices are tactically specific (counting spray beats, braiding pulses) and reveal a values shift. The renunciation of cage-like exactness carries a credible cost scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clean and specific—atonement through measured, material ritual—and every action aligns with the “balanced alchemist” ethos. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“throat full of luminous regret”), with credible contradiction between proof and wonder. The micro‑choices (testing variables, repairing the cup, pressing the coin) reveal a hierarchy of values. The Earned Stasis—accepting she won’t return while carrying the tether—feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, particular interiority (“modestly fearless” as practice) guides compassionate, non‑judgmental tactics. Micro‑choices—plucking misaligned strings, laughing with a crack, pressing the tooth to stone, standing aside at the clearing—reveal values under pressure. The renunciation (cannot enter the clearing) lands as earned cost. Minor safety in always‑competent handling prevents a perfect 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crisp and embodied: seeking a “mathematics of mercy” arises from surviving interrogation and the proprioceptive “gift.” Micro-choices—stepping deeper, writing with breath, knotting the strap—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. vow to limit harm) are dramatized rather than told. The caretaker beat crystallizes endurance as earned renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—recovering a lost name to “honor overlooked histories”—and actions align: placing the lens, speaking coordinates, gathering letters, naming. Interiority is embodied through sensory lexicon (tar, iron, hush) and the practiced “stillness while moving.” Contradictory impulses are subtler than ideal (competence dominates), but restraint (“I drank nothing…did not want a third [world]”) registers a cost-bearing choice. The painter adds light pressure, sharpening the narrator’s stance without hijacking the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct interiority and motive—“I repair elevators by day and argue with ghosts by night”—drive a credible, specific curiosity that becomes obligation. The internal conflict crystallizes at “To engage the mechanism meant admitting the debt,” showing contradictory pulls (duty vs. curiosity) acting in scene. Actions (dust‑reading, tile‑lifting, backward winding) align with this worldview and reveal character under pressure. The cost is understated but present in accepting responsibility and carrying the barrel as “a receipt.”

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Desire and duty collide convincingly: the operator longs to grant a perfect instant (rooted in the mother memory) while protecting the library’s buoyant imbalance. Micro‑choices—unscrewing the bottle, aligning to frost, pulling the lever—expose a hierarchy of values under pressure. The brief indulgence in perfection followed by codifying “wobble” reads as earned renunciation with cost. Interiority stays embodied through tactile imagery (ink, frost, platen) rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation and interiority are vivid and consistent: a defunct revolutionary-poet seeking proof beyond longing. Contradictory impulses (superstition vs method; hunger for consolation vs demand for evidence) are dramatized through the mirror‑covering “method.” Micro‑choices escalate (ordering shrouds, public readings, requesting a storm) and reveal values under pressure. The earned endurance at the end—accepting the revolution’s failure while revising the archive—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: reclaim the city’s light through craft and truth. “I wilt near dishonesty” is dramatized with the watchman’s lie and the confession about the stolen lullaby, giving us a credible flaw that shapes tactics. The renunciation of the shadow is a concrete price that aligns with values established earlier. Internal friction (guilt vs. duty; truth as both weakness and strength) runs through the negotiation and payment.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and character‑specific: a pragmatic collector of smells who pursues small, tactile miracles while courting the unknown. Contradictory impulses—list‑making sense versus surrender to failure—coexist and drive choices. The grief turn (“hinged awakening… that clicks but does not close”) feels earned by prior images. Minor note: the “widow was his widow” deduction arrives a touch conveniently but still aligns with the character’s perceptual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear—salvage and “reimagine passage”—and choices align with craft-competence under pressure. Interiority is textured and embodied (“trusting grain the way surgeons trust arteries”). Internal contradiction is mild (resolve outweighs doubt), which slightly softens complexity. Still, the vow at the end reads as an earned endurance shift rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline and sustained: the narrator’s drive to decode night-blooming translates into concrete tactics (scaffold study, waiting for twilight drafts, season-long labor). Interiority is specific and embodied through scent, glass, and labor rhythms. Internal tension is quiet but present (reverence versus inquiry; patience versus urgency). The closing acceptance—“my murals were doors”—reads earned by months of costed endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline and consistent—“to uncover truth in tension, not relief”—and every action aligns with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (arranging debris, feeding punches) and the felt cost of the scorching reverie. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. refusal to look away) operate on the page. Minor abstraction in some lines lightly distances us from bodily specifics at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iria’s motive—reviving the city without wishes—is coherent and enacted through concrete micro-choices (lantern placement, charter-writing, bell-ringing). Her refusal of “false comfort” reads as character-specific resolve rather than a label, shaping tactics. Internal contradiction is light; she’s steady more than torn, so cost is more conceptual than felt personally. The sailor adds light relational pressure but not deep status shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation (to archive emotional patterns) is vivid and tested against a credible counter-impulse (mercy through omission). Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile ritual (rainwater, wax thread) and occupational detail. The renunciation—folding the parchment and leaving the prophecy unarchived—earns its cost from prior vows and childhood imprint. No safety hedging: the narrator accepts reputational and ethical risk to protect a child and the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline (to keep and return “borrowed time”), embodied through naming, singing patterns, and planting. Interiority is specific and tactile (“furiously tranquil,” breath as “frost-laced bells”). The piece lacks pronounced contradictory impulses in scene; resistance or fear is muted, which trims complexity. Still, micro‑choices (naming Return, placing the cap, stepping through seasons) align with an earned acceptance of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear interior tension between procedural duty (throw the switch) and an ethic of listening yields a credible, character-specific choice. Embodied perception (“feel whether the wood and hemp had agreed to be one”) grounds emotion without labels. Reni’s presence adds pressure and shows leadership style under scrutiny. Slight hedge: the protagonist’s competence smooths struggle, keeping the felt cost restrained rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic; the janitor’s empathy for machines leads to concrete micro-choices (matching breath to fans, kneeling to “align” ears). The internal contradiction—hiding after heartbreak yet choosing radical attention—culminates in a credible renunciation at the boundary. Embodied emotion (copper/tea floor, honeyed light) grounds the lyric reflections. The final stance (polish marks into guidance) is earned by prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is precise and consistent: a former contract broker turned witness preserving “unspoken words.” His agency intensifies under pressure with the queen’s arrival; accepting culpability and marking the sigil read as an earned renunciation with cost (stings, heat, moral reckoning). Interiority stays concrete via tactile images (comb lectern, warmth), not labels. Minor note: contradictory impulses (guilt vs. caretaking serenity) are present but could surface with one sharper moment of hesitation before the sigil.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent: the narrator seeks to “understand the texture of time,” choosing tactics (pocketing the fragment, coded garage sales, waiting the hinge awake) that reveal character. Interiority is sensory and particular rather than diagnostic. The relationship with Lio adds pressure by reframing method, but internal contradiction is gentle—there’s little friction beyond renunciation of numerals. The earned endurance at the end carries cost (accepting waiting) but remains soft-focus rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, coherent motives (to “discover beauty in the incomplete”) drive the poet’s concrete choices, especially tending the boy rather than retrieving the kite. The boy’s embodied grief reads true (“wind inside him”), and the poet’s warmth steers action without feeling generic. Slight idealization of the poet-sage and limited contradictory impulses under pressure keep it shy of the very top. Still, micro-choices (feather offered, ribbon repurposed, raft released) reveal a credible value hierarchy with a felt price: accept loss.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—work over sorrow to leave a living legacy—and actions align (wiring, grafting, convening a council). Interiority remains embodied and particular (ears to stone, ink smudged with soil and salt), avoiding diagnostic shorthand. The internal conflict is quiet but present (teaching children “nothing of timelines” while racing a clock). Cost registers in fatigue and the final renunciation, though contradictory impulses could surface more under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation (to test an “artificial pilgrimage” without surrendering skepticism) is vivid and consistent, with embodied tension in gestures like the raised eyebrow and the careful handling of amber. Contradictory impulses—ritual versus inquiry—act simultaneously and guide micro‑choices (offering the talisman, pressing it to the pane). The change to “home is a rate constant” reads earned though the felt cost is subtle rather than acute. Secondary figures apply light pressure without diluting the single POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is specific and embodied: he replaces conquest with listening and cultivation, and his micro‑choices (following birds’ “grammar,” cracking pods “with a coachman’s care,” training vines on bayonets) align. Interiority is indirect but vivid through tactile labor and old‑tongue “translation.” The arc is an Earned Stasis: he persists in costly, patient work against salt, wind, and history. A minor limit: little visible internal contradiction; his stance is steady rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—turning the leaf into a bridge to her sister drives every act from barter to trek. Interiority is embodied and specific (“ears like folded flags,” “nose knew how grief fermented”). Contradictory impulses (longing vs. resignation to drought and delay) are present, with an Earned Stasis cost at the end (connection achieved, separation persists). Harbor’s small agency beat (dragging out the cylinder) adds relational texture without diluting the single POV.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied: the “blessed pariah” carries visible contradiction that informs choices on the deck. Micro‑choices (adjusting the circle, redefining the compass, writing the vow) reveal values under pressure. The cost—accepting a stigmatized identity and a mutable north—feels earned. Slight remove from any second character limits crucible dynamics, but the solo arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is coherent (a chivalrous thief who “takes only what harm has taken first”) and tested through micro-choices, especially embedding personal penance promises into the swapped pieces. Contradictory impulses—“cautious abandon,” fear vs. wonder—operate simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of wages and acceptance of ongoing mending registers as earned cost. Minor limitation: the teacher’s presence at the end adds affirmation but little additional pressure on the protagonist’s internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—archiving “small gestures” in a hostile regime—is vivid and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (coaching walkers, choosing words, refusing spectacle). Contradictions (former “crisis actor” vs. real survivor; “benevolently ruthless”) play on the page, not just in labels. The renunciation of the victim script creates a credible before/after with cost. Secondary figures are sketched but functionally pressure the POV without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (recover the “shape of home”) and credible internal conflict (self‑erasure vs. reclamation) are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices: accepting the feather, touching the stone, choosing what to seed, moving the shame‑encyclopedias, and speaking the final hello. Embodied sensations (feather barbs, stone warmth) keep emotions specific. A brief urge to deny (“I wanted to deny it”) provides a live counter‑impulse but could tighten with one more on‑page hesitation under peak pressure. Overall, the change reads earned and carries a felt cost: confronting past shame and relinquishing the safety of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (self‑forgiveness) catalyzes concrete micro‑choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses—competence vs. guilt, urge to “brilliant sacrifice” vs. slower tutelage—are dramatized, not told. The choice to leave pigeons frozen as a living cost memorializes flaw without neat absolution. Emotional texture is embodied through chess/weave attention rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The artist’s motive (reprice forgiveness through communal refracting) is clear and consistently dramatized, with guilt over the mentor providing credible pressure. Micro‑choices—launching the sessions, withholding the child from paying, offering to pay twice—reveal values with cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“felt the vibration climb the palm like a warning”). Slightly idealized steadiness undercuts deeper contradiction, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is concrete and particular: salt-and-solder hands, breath held in a cistern, and “kintsugi intentions” all expose lived contradiction between doubt and vow. Motivation (to conjure meaning, to ask the “right question”) drives specific actions: tracing pockmarks, soldering seams, fitting the charm. The final stance—acceptance of pattern over resurrection—carries felt cost and reads earned. Minor lyric heightening never detaches from embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—“intimately aloof” yet compelled by “salt ghosts”—and the micro‑choices (following the brine/smoke path, dipping the shell, painting only a breath, leaving the corridor) align with the vow and its cost. The fear is acknowledged without melodrama, and restraint at the climax reads as character‑true. Slight softness: the struggle feels mostly lyric rather than frictional, with limited on‑page resistance beyond declared fear.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive—proving whispers over shouts—drives concrete tactics (steeping petals, humming, using the vial). Interiority is specific and embodied (“loses its need to be right”), with a credible tension between restraint and the urge to assert. The mentor dynamic briefly but effectively pressures the desire to be believed. The earned endurance at the end (workful listening) forecloses the easy path of horn/shout without tidy sanctimony.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and embodied choices: she builds, sets out, places the censer foot, accepts a route with rather than to Mara. Contradictory impulses (search vs. acknowledgment of irrevocable loss) act simultaneously, especially when the needle settles “in the loss itself.” Motivations are consistent and escalate credibly from repair to ritual. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motives and constraints are crisply embodied: a rational forager compelled to tell the truth who still chooses to smuggle, hide, and invite scrutiny. Contradictory impulses (evidence vs rumor; transparency vs concealment) act simultaneously on the page and drive tactics (mud on the eye, knot-hole, honest invitation). Emotional texture is specific (“laughter snagged…notes that cracked”), avoiding stock labels. The Earned Stasis of continuing the practice despite risk feels motivated by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive (“investigate by… observing gaps”) animate concrete micro‑choices (searching seams, testing the notch, deciding to signal). The eccentric keeper’s worldview coheres without safety‑hedging. Internal contradiction is subtle—faith in signals versus doubt in the answering light—but present. The endurance choice at the end (witness over shrine) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular: the promise to Ruth and the lure of the “doorway of decisions” drive each micro‑choice. Contradictory impulses—retreat to “maps that ask nothing back” vs. stepping into the seam—are dramatized rather than told. Embodied emotion shows in sensory anchors (electric air, water pressing shins) and object‑relation (the chip’s weight aligning steps). The final renunciation of ease (taking the chip back, crossing the risen creek) reads earned with a modest but felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clean and persistent—she leaves the crown to pursue the dream’s riddle—while contradictory impulses (“I do not want the throne to end” vs. refusal to be a “ghost of unasked questions”) sharpen at the grotto. Interiority is embodied through tactile images (salted crown, wind combing braids) rather than labels. The relationship with the wanderer functions as a crucible that tests resolve without stealing agency. The wake/merge choice is earned and carries a credible cost flagged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and particular, with embodied choices (“we do not kiss; we calibrate”) revealing a value hierarchy under pressure. The relationship functions as a crucible, as the friend’s whispered dare redirects tactics and intimacy. Motivation is consistent—scientifically romantic devotion to presence—though internal contradiction is subtle rather than acute. The earned renunciation of romance for “repeatable wonder” reads as a credible, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and singular, with a credible tug‑of‑war between envy for past selves and a disciplined present that “bows to chaos without kneeling.” The micro‑choices—using jealousy as a method, bargaining with feral nostalgia, refusing to descend to correct the funeral—reveal values under pressure. Motivation (to distill chaos into narrative) drives every action and is tested. The Earned Stasis at the end (keep walking, accept non‑resurrection) feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct, embodied interiority (“I learned to hear what cannot declare itself”) and micro‑choices under pressure (keeping the door unlatched, teaching “the breaths”) reveal values. The father’s relinquishing of the clamp screw (“from her bag, which is all I have left”) shows credible cost and deepens him beyond a function. The narrator’s tremble/calm contradiction is lived on the page, not declared. Change lands as Earned Stasis: a chosen posture of attentive holding with visible cost honored.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and particular—transform scars into legible runes within a single held breath—and actions align with that goal. Interiority is embodied (lungs as gates, pulse unlatching, steam as page) and admits contradictions (shame versus ritual composure, superstition versus scholarly method). Micro‑choices under pressure (which scars to prioritize, when to drink) reveal values with cost. The change reads as an earned endurance: she reconfigures her relationship to pain through ritual rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is precise and pressured: to apologize and reconnect before the orchard falls. Contradictory impulses—profession as rumor‑monger vs. loyalty/guilt—act simultaneously and drive choice. Embodied emotion arrives through tactile, idiosyncratic perceptions (jasmine, iron filings, “cracked teacup” metaphors). The final decision to risk career capital by calling the foreman is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear (“unravel cosmic illusions”) and pursued through concrete micro‑choices (opening the dictionary at Listen, loosening straps, naming illusions). The interior conflict—certainty surrendered for listening—reads earned (“Each pace gave away my certainty and returned a clearer question”). Embodied perception is distinct (warmth in the stone, hush filling the chest), with a credible renunciation at the end. The only limit is a largely solitary crucible that keeps interpersonal pressure off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (“to understand what clocks really measure”) drives concrete micro-choices: staying after shift, heretical valve nudges, counting backwards, and the final refusal to “correct” the lag. Interiority is embodied and particular (gull-bone needles, blood drip timing), with a credible tension between protocol and intuition. The small physical cost (the cut) and the reputational risk of the note make the endurance/renunciation feel earned. The epiphany is lyric but grounded in actions taken on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives (teaching the farm to “listen without fear” while testing grief) are vivid and drive specific micro-choices: not rushing the cat’s classification, tracing steam back to a strut, and re‑tuning shelves. Interiority is distinct and embodied through spatial/music metaphors that reveal worldview under pressure. The internal conflict—control vs. letting go—operates in‑scene and culminates in a credible renunciation. Slight limitation: external pressure is gentle, so the cost registers more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and particular, with a live contradiction (thrill of risk vs. stewardship) driving concrete choices: she follows the scrawls, lifts the lantern, takes the theorem, and reframes her teaching. The gambler/professor lineage feels earned rather than labeled, especially at “Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater.” Emotional cost is present—she accepts responsibility against inherited impulse—though it’s quiet rather than searing. Relationship pressure with the father is off‑page but active enough to sharpen her motive and the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motive—“to teach endings how to begin”—is embodied through concrete micro‑choices: spinning the disc to “tune her breath,” looping lines, routing a crew, and pointedly not speaking to the child. Her cultivated estrangement creates a live contradiction: she facilitates intimacy while refusing entry (“If she entered, she knew the room would tilt toward her”). The cost lands when Rojo hangs up without goodbye and she stays outside the doorframes. A minor limit: secondary figures are vivid but off‑page, so relationship pressure is mediated rather than direct.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s motive (“I did not repair, I remembered”) governs every micro‑choice—asking for proximate causes, walking the jetty, drawing lines—revealing a coherent, particular psyche. Emotions are embodied through tactile acts (steeping the nib, mapping fingertip to plank) rather than labels. The woman’s need is sketched efficiently and pressures the archivist’s ethic without collapsing it. The final renunciation—stepping back—reads earned and costly in its restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The logistician’s motives (cure loneliness via logistics) are clear, embodied, and tested under storm pressure; the narrator’s stance shifts from observer to participant. Contradictory impulses—“desperately jocular and softly tired”—surface in on‑page choices (moon rock protocol, assignments, postcards). Micro‑choices reveal values and cost (promises made under a leaking skylight; sleep traded for maps). The ending’s quiet renunciation of name in favor of work lands as earned stasis rather than sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and particular (seek the stillpoint to learn grief’s contours, not erase it), and micro-choices under pressure (following pitches, kneeling, dowsing, consenting to “axis”) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (skin-language, ring temperature) rather than labeled. The internal contradiction—merchant of certainties vs. refusal of erasure—registers, though frictive ambivalence could sharpen earlier. The final endurance choice (carry grief as axis) reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—shame and precision, doubt and agency—are embodied and tested when they steal and use Del’s pen. Micro‑choices (breathing with the Quiet, refusing to look at the pen, drawing terraces instead of words) reveal a distinct hierarchy of values. The relationship with Del applies gentle pressure that alters tactics without stealing agency. The earned shift to “strange comfort” forecloses self‑flagellation in favor of responsibility with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arin’s goal is clear and embodied through specific micro‑choices (asking the bell’s rust for permission, letting the tide wash the map, carrying the empty camera as a vow). The internal tension between honoring silence and “disrupting the obedient quiet” reads as a credible, character‑specific conflict. The advisor applies subtle pressure that shapes tactics without stealing agency. Emotional texture (“joyful sorrow”) lands through action rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—protect readers, find Miren, decode the archive—and actions align cleanly with those aims. Contradictory impulses (arson as preservation; “volcanic tenderness”) operate simultaneously, not alternately. The protagonist’s final renunciation/recommitment (“lending of breath, not pages”) is earned by the breadcrumbed discoveries. Minor ding: solutions come a touch easily, minimizing felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: bridge to Mira despite medical control, with a credible cost (accepting donors, surrendering to security). Interiority is vivid and particular, showing rebellious poise alongside tenderness and fear. Micro-choices (perching, tapping codes, stepping onto the bridge, giving wrists) align with values. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis that forecloses a simpler “recovery” path.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ivo’s competence, tactile knowledge, and quiet confidence are vividly embodied (“knows each weld seam like a vein,” reading walks), and his wager with Rade shows stakes-aware agency. Interiority is specific (coin as pause cue) and actions align with motive. However, he encounters little internal contradiction or visible struggle; the outcome feels relatively easy for him. The relationship dynamic with Rade turns, but the cost to Ivo remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, embodied interiority (“a familiar door in my chest lift and breathe”) and credible micro-choices (taking and angling the mirror) reveal grief, shame, and a hard-won openness. The guardian’s pressure is cleanly external yet intimate, catalyzing action without speech. Slight mythic idealization of the guardian trims the grit of human flaw, but the narrator’s contradictions land. The renunciation/endurance at the end feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (to slow a town through “humble rebellion”) animates concrete actions; interiority is specific (“title never fit my shoes,” trembling plans). Contradictory impulses—strategist vs. doubter—coexist on the page. The earned renunciation at the end (“live with our next moves unfinished”) feels credible, though the cost remains subtle rather than bite-hard visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is clear and specific: shed “hardshell,” speak the true name, and cross to fix what vanishes. Interiority is embodied and contradictory—“combative tenderness” and the fear/desire of being witnessed create live friction. Micro‑choices (detaching lines, lifting the scrimshaw, inviting the crowd) align with stakes and reveal values. The change—public self‑naming and acceptance of visibility—forecloses the old guarded stance with a felt social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—preserve “lightness in grief” under a coercive happiness regime—and every key act (handling the inspector, teaching “unflaggable” pause, turning off the mics, the final on‑camera refusal) coheres with it. The narrator’s moral ambiguity is dramatized, not asserted, through teaching compliance postures while smuggling hush. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular; the “blank face” as both costume and insurance feels lived, not labeled. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost in risk and vacancy.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses—fear versus longing to gather—are embodied in the “we” and sharpened by the poet’s invitations (breathing together, stepping across the inlaid line). The former guard’s badge removal shows a credible cost and micro-choice under pressure. The poet’s motive (to dissolve boundaries) is consistent and enacted in scene. Interiority is carried through tactile images rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivo’s motive—to find beauty in imperfection—is embodied through sensory substitutions (flavoring smoke, feeling cobbles) and plant-coded choices. His trade of the cherished brush and the jar of smoke shows real cost and commitment. The relationship with Mira is deftly dramatized via botanical exchanges that pressure and then enable his decision to stay. Internal conflict (wanting color vs. accepting a different awakening) resolves credibly in an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—to design an honest, reparative listening pilgrimage—guides concrete micro‑choices (unlocking the cabinet, deploying the lens, pausing when a listener flinches). Contradictory impulses (guiding vs. refusing spectacle; knowing vs. “without pretending we understand”) are dramatized rather than told. The response to the volunteer’s grief shows embodied empathy and adjustment of tactic. The quiet renunciation—ending without destination—reads as an earned stance with a subtle cost of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular: a mourning jeweler seeking a viable practice of grief after Devin’s death. Interiority is embodied through tools and processes (lockets, wire, projector) rather than labels. Micro‑choices—pressing Illuminate, using the stencil, creating the wire ritual, deciding to wait—track a credible endurance with cost. The contradiction between self‑blame (“I had mangled both”) and service generates authentic tension without neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Two vivid figures emerge: the tactile, curious apprentice and the precise, ethically rigorous cartomancer. Motivation aligns with action (accepting any currency; using tools to “multiply paths”), and small choices reveal values under pressure (reframing the last client’s ask). Interiority is specific but not deeply contradictory; the narrator’s inner conflict remains understated. Still, the relationship dynamic and embodied craft give the piece lived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clean and sustained: to seek forbidden knowledge without conquest. Contradictory impulses are dramatized through micro-choices (refusing the tablets’ bargain, “avoiding patterns,” accepting alteration while renouncing publication). Embodied emotion reads specific (“my saffron-veil historian credentials trembling,” the compass warming, twilight dyeing fingers). The final renunciation (“I did not publish…”) carries credible cost and aligns with established values.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s motives (preserve hope vs. protect the library’s balance) drive concrete choices—agreeing to help, using the river stone, bargaining with the vines, and paying with her stored dreams. Interiority is embodied and specific (“trained by years of listening to colors fade”), not label‑speak. The cost lands on her—she loses the life she didn’t live—an earned renunciation. Minor note: Ilen is lightly sketched but functions as focused pressure rather than dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is rich and specific: the handler refuses rage in favor of precision, pares the terrarium, and makes the measured cut. Conflicting impulses—hope versus skepticism, compassion versus self-respect—play simultaneously (“We will take only what refuses to heal”). Micro‑choices under pressure reveal values and cost. The endurance at the end (inviting scrutiny, renouncing ornament) is earned and forecloses easier paths.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Compelling interior contradiction (“closure seeker who opens wounds”) fuels concrete choices: descending without a lamp, letting plants lead, and breaking Mira’s hourglass. Embodied detail (numb fingers, pins of sensation) grounds emotion. The sacrifice of the hourglass reads as a felt cost aligned with her flaw. A hairline risk remains around how smoothly the “displaced miracle” motivates the exact ritual, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (to locate where unused love is stored) guides tactile, character‑specific choices (threading film, palm to gate, opening letters). Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory metaphors that feel earned. The self‑implication—finding boxes stamped with her own name—creates credible internal conflict. Writing “a new goodbye that said, stay” registers an earned, value‑laden shift with implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and sustained (the burden of hearing unspoken words), and micro-choices under pressure read specific (aligning, copying, resting, returning). The gift/curse contradiction is active on the page and informs tactics. Some feeling states are summarized lyrically rather than dramatized at peak beats, slightly softening the felt cost. Overall, interiority and action cohere with credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (“to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners”) drives concrete micro‑choices: humming the charm, flipping/whispering to the clock, choosing the shortest night, not looking too soon, placing spores. Interiority stays embodied through tactile images (cold drafts brushing knuckles; pacing gravel). The guard’s contradictory state (dreamless caretaker vs. “occasionally everywhere”) adds tension without tidy resolution. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with felt cost (no dreams, ongoing duty).

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coherent interiority with a clear motive (“rediscover the wild frontier”) and a live contradiction (“I did not want to repair it” yet choosing to). Embodied perception is specific and character‑particular, turning engineering metaphors into feelings. The repair choice feels earned by the ache in the hum and the practiced method. Slight remove from visceral emotion keeps it shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, embodied motivation (“to find where unused courage waits”) drives concrete micro‑choices: stepping into a skiff that floats on choices, selecting bends that resemble old fear, and finally reaching for the shimmer. The internal contradiction—fear of the wrong way versus compulsion to go—acts simultaneously on the page. The change at the end (reaching and carrying the skiff within) feels earned by prior steps and patience. Secondary pressure from the guides remains facilitative rather than coercive, keeping the protagonist’s agency central.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (pain as metronome; shocks as letters), with motives clear: to remain through winter and renegotiate the price of safety. Micro-choices under pressure—pocketing the bolt, consenting to repair, sitting despite pain, and ultimately choosing to remain—feel earned. The bellhop’s presence applies soft but tangible pressure, turning gestures into stakes. Slightly low on contradiction-in-action beyond endurance, but the endurance reads as an earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyr’s motive (to expose a pretender without blunt accusation) is clear and consistent with his “regally unpretentious” methods, and Serane’s pride and tremor read on the page through action (following bookmarks, the ink’s reveal, the tears). Status dynamics are legible: Lyr’s quiet control versus Serane’s brittle authority. Interiority is mostly externalized via objects and ritual rather than direct thought, costing a shade of psychological complexity. Still, Serane’s renunciation carries credible cost and feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is precise and sustained: the keeper seeks to learn why paths vanish and adapts tactics (pressing “Assemble,” decoding taps, convening the village). Interiority is specific to a diver/monitor’s sensibility and avoids platitudes. Contradictory impulses (skepticism of the key’s label vs need to risk pressing it; scientific inference vs communal ritual) create live tension. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting a road that only exists in time) feels earned with a subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive (find meaning/find the Lark/father) is clear and embodied in tactile choices (ear to deckplates, closing the circuit with skin). Her internal tension—risk versus need—is present if understated, surfacing in “permission” after the siren chirps. Actions align with her non‑fighter stance while still showing agency. The endurance/change at the end (from echo‑hunter to orientation‑bearer) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lida’s motive—evolve tradition with intent—is clear, rooted in lived history and embodied via her plant‑telepathy and insurgent past. The oath to wait versus her choice to act supplies credible internal tension without melodrama. Micro‑choices (following the reeds, confronting the council, unsealing alone) align with her values. The emotional cost is mostly social and implied rather than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rafi’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a trauma-tempered gardener seeking “doors, not denial,” who freezes at rotor noise yet moves through Leda’s tasking. His embodied responses (“named sensations… waited until they shrank”) and the steadying of his hands at the end feel earned. Therapy-lexicon risks are offset by concrete action and sensory anchoring. The change is an endurance stance with cost: he keeps choosing care under a persistent wound.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, embodied motivation (“descend into necessary darkness”) drives concrete micro‑choices: mapping suits to shelves, choosing the stair, improvising a wick. Contradictory impulses—self‑salvage vs. saving a place she doesn’t own—surface (“save a lighthouse…or save her eye”) and inform the act. Emotional texture stays character‑particular (artist’s attention to faces/lenses) without therapy‑speak. The closing inscription credibly seals a stance change with a felt cost of responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: return to end the market born of a mentor’s death and a craft’s abuse. Interiority is specific (“serene anger,” “consciously wild stillness”) and actions align (spilling ink, reading patterns, refusing the throne). The final renunciation is earned by prior craft knowledge and history with disappearing ink. Minor note: internal contradiction is present but subtle; the temptation scene could press cost even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and particular, with a credible contradiction between duty and the hunger to provoke change. Micro-choices (warming the seal, ritualizing hesitation, timing breath) reveal values under pressure. The cost—professional risk and betrayal of archival purity—is felt if not yet cashed. No safety‑hedging; the narrator accepts ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (tend mercy and continuity) drives concrete micro‑choices: asking visitors to sheathe knives, tying the scrap to a rose, redirecting blame into naming seedlings. The “bounty hunter’s pacifist daughter” paradox animates her restraint without sermonizing. Emotional texture is embodied through tools, heat, and sand rather than labels. A minor softness: she rarely falters; struggle is felt but largely managed.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fisher’s motive—listening to recover a coastline rather than trophy-taking—is clear and consistent, and micro-choices (casting silence, planting the spike, relinquishing the map) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is specific (“calm is a net you mend every hour”) and embodied through tactile rail‑spike handling. The internal tension between seeking and surrendering culminates credibly in the final give‑back. Slight distance from sharper flaw exposure keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, consistent drive (“to discover hidden truths”) expressed through concrete micro-choices: the wager to shutter the lens, placing the nib, and calling the board. Contradictory impulses (devotion to truth vs. mercy and heritage) are embodied rather than labeled. The caretaker’s pressure sharpens her choices without stealing agency. Minor: the caretaker edges archetype, but he still reveals complexity and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich interiority and a credible, contradictory drive (pretending to map forward while atoning) guide concrete micro-choices: consulting the recorder, inking the client, then tattooing themself. Embodied costs show in images like “crossed my pulse like a bridge.” The relationship with the sleepless mother is brief but applies focused pressure. Slight abstraction in places keeps the body at a half‑step remove, but the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and character‑particular (“chalk is a listening stone”), and her micro‑choice to interject versus letting the hush self‑govern reveals a real value trade‑off. Contradictory impulses (facilitate vs. not smoothing with “lovely lies”) are present without being over‑tidy. Secondary figures are sketched efficiently with specific tells (the bearded man’s “small landslide,” the moss‑shawled child). The cost is subtle—she chooses mess over mastery—yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) drives concrete choices: aiding the boy, summoning the men, refusing vengeance in favor of tasked renaming. The internal contradiction (“warm coldness”) is embodied through steel arms cradling shards and the plaza’s careful cadence. Slight softness: the men’s compliance comes too easily, reducing visible resistance to the narrator’s ethos. Still, the final renaming reads as an earned endurance with implied social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motives are clear and embodied through synesthetic perception and ritual caretaking; the cashier/conductor self‑image grounds choice when the ghost panics. Internal tension—preservation versus “finish letting go”—is present but understated. The decisive act (pressing the coin, speaking marquee letters) aligns with established traits. A slightly deeper on‑page cost to the narrator would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motives are clear and particular: easing grief by retrieving memory through a jointly devised method. The narrator’s anxiety (misreading taps) and Mara’s skepticism/affection give live contradiction. Micro‑choices under pressure (counting down, resuming; codifying taps/breaths) reveal values. The emotional shift—Mara not flinching, shoulders softening—reads earned and paid for through vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation (becoming a voice without ownership) is clear and consistently tested by choices of restraint: listening, negotiating, and finally leaving the fossil. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“factually mystical,” counting drops like syllables), with embodied actions under pressure. The storm forces a credible trade‑off between safety and stewardship, revealing values. A mild lack of contradiction (the narrator is very composed) keeps this shy of the top band but it reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motives are vivid and specific (rebellion against a lock-like script; oath reframed), and actions align: theft, the jar’s opening, the communal offering. Contradictory impulses—devotion to craft vs. defiance of elders—coexist on the page. The cost is gentled (“confessed without punishment”), so the crucible never fully bites. Still, interiority is rich and embodied through concrete work with sand, resin, and buttons.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motivation (scarred body, pillbox history) fuels specific, pressured micro-choices. His “prudently daring” tactician’s mindset manifests in the snow‑code method and the measured disposal of leverage. The relationship with Len tightens choices and reveals character through silent codes and the ring reveal. The final renunciation (film to sea) feels earned, with a credible cost and an interior realignment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: deliver the parcel/promise and “distill complexity into essence.” The coachman’s micro‑choices (offering the needle, committing to the crossing, finding rhythm on the oar) reveal a patient, attentive temperament under pressure. Relationship dynamics with Wren sharpen the choices and evolve credibly (“your road is water tonight”). The emotional cost is quiet but felt: accepting fear and labor as part of the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive and steady, character‑particular interiority; her micro‑choices (giving the last water, shaping/firing cups, placing them “in each timeline”) align with a disciplined ethos of holding without forcing. Contradictory impulses are subtle rather than dramatic, skewing toward serenity over friction. Visible cost includes water sacrifice and time/effort under heat. The endurance choice at the end (to be that someone elsewhere) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clean and compelling (to rekindle the light for the living) and anchored in specific traits (fire-escape gardener, locksmith’s child). Interiority is embodied and particular—the bitting gauge, patched skiff, brittle wick tie grief to action. Contradictory impulses (tremor vs resolve; wistfulness vs pragmatism) play in-scene. The final choice reads earned, with a felt emotional cost coded in the quiet surrender of the shackle and the shake in the wrists.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motive—translate isolation into independence—embodied through careful, task‑based choices (wick, pitch, atlas, herd song). The interiority is particular and sensorial, though internal contradiction is subdued; the narrator remains highly competent with little true slippage. Cost is felt conceptually (risk of shelves dropping, endurance) but not deeply personalized as loss. Still, the micro‑choices under atmospheric pressure reveal values credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is lucid (to connect all things; to help two estranged lovers) and the keeper-of-secrets vs. public staging tension gives real stakes. The decisive choice—tucking and then unveiling the letters—feels earned and character-specific. Emotions are embodied via tactile acts (threads, bowl, leaves) rather than abstractions. A touch more on the narrator’s fear of betraying trust would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—“Static had tempers; silence had accents”—and the narrator’s ethos (cautious hope held until evidence) drives choices. Temptation vs. principle surfaces under pressure when the wave offers tenure and the dean offers a chair. Embodied moments (tingling palms, hiss to breath to friction) ground the thinking. The renunciation at the end feels earned and costs status/power.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is particular and embodied—the breath of a claustrophobe used as tactic, the “tightness behind my ribs,” and the chalk/compass micro‑choices under pressure. Contradiction (claustrophobic yet keeps walking) actively shapes decisions and risk tolerance. The retrieval and public threading of the key show earned endurance with a felt social cost (defying the Council). A minor limit: the emotional price is more atmospheric than cutting, keeping this shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s prosopagnosia and methodical temperament drive concrete choices (lancing, refusing to pocket items, painting people without faces). A credible contradiction—hunger to know versus renunciation of certainty—culminates in “I do not know who harmed her.” Interiority is particular and embodied via tactile engagements (knot, ribbon, rebar). Minor distance from on‑page interpersonal friction limits the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (honor the ancestor) drives concrete choices, and “nervously confident” manifests in the bold but anxious activation of the panel. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spongey dread,” “like a rickety priest”). Relationship pressure appears briefly but effectively via Liza, sharpening the moral calculus. Minor note: the cost to the narrator remains mostly institutional/social rather than personally perilous on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my hands vote otherwise,” “a heart making drum corps noises”), with a credible contradiction between skepticism and committed belief. The fiddler’s choices—following the fluttering map, descending under the bridge, playing “the measure that forgives”—align with motive and escalate cost. Relationship pressure with the hitchhiker culminates in a felt shift (“You did not have to… but I did”). The change toward future‑leaning counting reads earned rather than announced.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear (to understand why paths circle back) and actions align (founding the startup, tying ribbons, refusing to overpromise). Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile images (paper money, ribbons, dusk maps). Contradictory impulses—enterprise versus custodianship; calm restraint versus investor pressure—are present but mostly accrue in summary rather than dramatized turns. The renunciation at shutdown reads earned and carries felt cost (emptied cars, useless bright ribbons).

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motives are clear and particular: fear-bound withholding (weeks of avoiding the telegram) yields to a risked opening and a practice of dialogic decoding. Interiority is sensuous and embodied (daylily rasp, red lamps, dome clicks), with credible micro‑choices (asking Mara to answer back) that reveal values. Pressure is gentle but real: the renunciation of solitary mastery for vulnerable witnessing. The relationship dynamic is restrained yet distinct, with mutual urgency and a lived history (her father’s dome) shaping stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: a guarded professional finder driven both by hire and by a private curiosity about mirrors. Micro-choices under pressure (mapping circles, committing the single seed, negotiating “eat only the lie”) reveal values and risk tolerance. Contradictory impulses surface credibly—warlike serenity vs. a heart that “unbends one unmilitant notch.” The mayor’s presence exerts credible external pressure without needing direct dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (“roots in my ankles and questions in my ribs”), with credible contradictory impulses (“anxious elation” making them “brave and foolish”). Micro-choices under pressure are clear: consenting to scar-linking, heeding the leaves, stepping onto the maze, refusing the gardeners, proposing a braided vow. The graft to the mapletree functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and perspective. Slight softness: the gardeners yield quickly, so the protagonist’s cost feels more conceptual than acutely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline from the first line and borne out by micro-choices (giving the boy the narrator’s name; planting what cannot be kept). Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding abstract labels. The “reckless idealist” contradiction animates action, though internal push‑pull under peak pressure could tighten further. Visible cost lands in giving up the grandmother’s last stories.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and conflicted: the vow to “feel nothing” fights the involuntary recognition of the houndstooth scrap. Micro‑choices (measuring first, then repricing the scrap) reveal values under pressure. The visible cost is loosening the factual armor to admit Leon and the burn mark’s meaning. Stakes are mostly internal but scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is precise (reestablish the arbor’s harmony; seek “the physics of transition”), and actions align with the “kindly methodical” temperament in tactile, specific ways (walking node by node, pressing tablets to bark). The internal contradiction—haunted ambition versus acceptance—operates in scene and resolves credibly in the closing realization. Embodied perception (grooves, hums, rails’ undertone) keeps emotion concrete. The cost is the renunciation of “owning transition,” earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct, embodied narrator with a coherent professional ethos; micro-choices (asking “who she is today,” taking her to metallurgy, using the creel and bells) reveal values under gentle pressure. The woman’s need is legible and specific, though her interiority remains thin. Internal contradiction is implied (keeper of routine preserving wonder) more than dramatized in conflict. The arc lands as earned endurance rather than decisive self-risk, limiting peak charge.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character‑particular interior conflict—“isolate, calculate, fortify” vs “listen, braid, release”—drives credible micro‑choices. The inspector’s perceptions (turning off sensors, palm brightening inward) embody emotion without therapy‑speak. The renunciation of “safety for solitude” lands as earned. Minor idealization (competence without much mess) trims the edge of flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, idiosyncratic interiority with embodied guilt and craft: the chronicler’s copying of coordinates and transect thinking reveal character under pressure. Contradictory impulses—need for control vs. surrender to the river’s truth—operate simultaneously. The final shift (marking the margin, stopping asking the river to be them) is earned by on‑page experience and costs the protagonist a self‑protective misbelief. Minor note: the “daringly methodical” self‑label risks neatness but is supported by behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and particular (“to find the library of unspoken words before silence hardened”), with embodied contradiction—“cautious exuberance,” guilt over the watch, and a vow not to “touch its bones.” The final stance—accepting the cost of burning the first letter and becoming a messenger who “speaks by learning when to wait”—is earned by patient micro‑choices (listening to “the speech between ticks,” breathing to write). Emotional texture is concrete via object handling and breath-work. The only small limit is that the cost manifests mainly as pledged renunciation rather than an immediate sacrifice enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation: a provenance researcher torn between paycheck/empire and a promise/dream. Interiority is embodied and specific (fern murmur, coffee “peasant astronomy,” the “mulberry ache” at his ribs). Micro‑choices escalate credibly (tightening the bow, placing the cup, choosing to play, catching the final drop). Slight idealization—legal/financial consequences are implied more than dramatized—keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline (to “capture one last spark”) and actions align: tuning, placing the chip, anointing, sealing. Interiority is embodied and particular to her craft, balancing control and grief. Contradictory impulses (belief vs guild’s skepticism, duty vs letting go) are present without overstatement. The final endurance—keeping shimmer, not resurrection—reads as an earned renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystal: a caretaker seeking contentment after forgiving a mother she fled, with the heirloom hairpin as emotional lever. Interiority is embodied through tactile choices (climbing, pruning, planting map scraps) rather than declaratives. The renunciation of the hairpin registers as a credible cost that fits her “kindly decisive” ethos. Internal contradiction (attachment vs. caretaking duty) is quiet but legible and drives the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivations are crisp and lived-in: the narrator sells doubt; Lark fears certainty yet seeks truth. Contradictory impulses act on the page (saving boats vs. electoral integrity), culminating in “speak and set terms.” Micro‑choices (unhooking the brake, asking what she wants her people to become) reveal hierarchy of values. The cost is credible and accepted without safety‑hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motives (“study disappearance… learn how to be seen”) drive concrete micro‑choices: dropping the stone, enduring withholding, agreeing to “release” in the village vision. Interiority is embodied and specific (“Patience tasted of lake smoke and copper”). The mentor‑student dynamic applies pressure without flattening either character; his reverse‑ageing and gentle refusals sharpen the narrator’s need. The earned change—accepting vanishing as presence with cost—reads credible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    A clear, particular interior guides credible micro-choices: tying the arrowhead to the cord, choosing stillness, tuning breath to birds, and finally casting the point. The central want (“learn to navigate without moving”) is dramatized rather than told, with embodied checkpoints (hum, flock patterns, tremor on the cord). Contradictory pulls—craft motion vs. chosen stillness; tool-use vs. renunciation—surface without overstatement. The closing choice to leave the stones and keep the cord empty reads as an earned renunciation with felt cost to identity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline (resisting automated imagination to find “the sacred in the simple”) and actions align: climbing, fitting the keystone, refusing ownership, and setting up the blank‑paper table. Interiority is embodied and particular (“the cold rang like a tiny bell in my teeth”). Contradiction is active: “underachieving” as a lid vs “mage” as a fragile cup, culminating in the renunciation to be “apprentice forever.” The only limitation is the absence of an external foil on the page to sharpen conflict via relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: a lamplighter seeking the literal “color of sound” reveals a temperament that “hides behind truth.” Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. vow‑making) coexist credibly and are embodied in patient underwater reading and breath control. Micro‑choices—diving, handling the key tag, accepting the vows’ discipline—align with motive. The final renunciation (to “light the pier without tiring of attention”) is an earned endurance stance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s role as “cast lots decision maker” gives a precise internal conflict—control versus surrender—that tightens through action. Embodied specifics (coins as “compact planets,” Sori’s callused palms, “black dew” of doubt) ground emotion. The turn where shame “falls away” earns the shift by prior beats demonstrating reluctance and competence under pressure. Relationship dynamics with Sori are understated but functional, providing immediate counterpressure and steadiness.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline (naming fears to redress Miren’s loss), and micro-choices under pressure are vivid (taping the atlas, steadying it, using the scythe as a focusing line). Contradictory impulses register on the page—“useless tenderness” alongside the grim craft. The final renunciation/commitment to ongoing work feels earned with visible cost (no triumph, only a “new corridor of work”). A minor hedge: the internal conflict is mostly lyric rather than dramatized through a live interlocutor.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Efan’s motive—steady belief in “plausible impossibility”—is enacted through micro‑choices (counting drips, threading seaweed, timing syllables) under a sunrise clock. His “brittle devotion” threatens to snap and shapes gentle tactics, a credible flaw. Interiority is concrete and embodied (aching knees, salt‑sung back). The fisherman’s brief presence provides a soft relational crucible without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (duty vs. memory) drives precise micro‑choices—naming foundations, pocketing the label only with cause, convening people despite orders. Contradictory impulses coexist credibly (bureau neutrality vs. humane stewardship). The choice to gather residents reads as an earned renunciation with implied professional cost. Minor softness: his personal ache around the blue label could cut deeper in-body once under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she refuses to read the formulas, privileging wonder and embodied listening. Contradictory impulses (ledger vs. lullaby) are dramatized through micro‑choices (small flame, ribbon ritual, placing the reliquary under roots). The felt cost is a renunciation of control/certainty in favor of calibrated trust. Quiet but credible change culminates in “walked out carrying nothing but balance.”

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear, embodied interiority with contradictory impulses: confident pattern‑reader versus guilt over a prior failure (“the scar he keeps is a line under our friendship”). Micro‑choices under pressure—green‑blue lanterns, rail‑taps, withholding apology—reveal values. The relationship pressure with the pilot culminates in the charged nod, an Earned Stasis that accepts ongoing cost. No safety‑hedging; competence is balanced by doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, specific interiority (“ego death survivor,” frost of numbness) and credible micro‑choices under pressure culminate in initiating the final test and rendering a joint verdict. Contradictory impulses—detached recorder vs. invested kin—coexist on the page. The emotional thaw reads earned by observed practice, not declared epiphany. Minor note: Rae and Neri’s interiorities remain external, but that’s apt for the POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—to protect a fragile, meaning-first design ethos against louder profit—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (planting the seed, drafting rules, locking the annex). Contradictory impulses (stewardship vs. commercial pressure) are lived rather than told, especially in “Profit would trickle, but meaning would flow.” Embodied perception (cedar, ozone, damp planks) grounds interiority. The cost-bearing endurance at the end reads earned for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Desire is clear and particular: he’s vowed to “restore lost laughter,” and his tactics spring from that vow. Interiority is embodied through ritual and pain (knuckles reddening, kissing the pull cord), and the “mournfully eager” tension holds. Contradictory impulses surface—yearning for brightness while honoring grief’s weight (“knowing the rungs may splinter”). The quiet endurance at the end reads as an earned stance, not a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline (“I have come to make friends with uncertainty”) and borne out through the binding choice to “wait” and to interiorize rather than cross. Interiority is vivid and embodied (frostbite reading, breath tithe), showing contradiction between homesick ache and chosen endurance. The guardian as foil sharpens values without over‑explaining. A hair of abstraction remains, but the micro‑choices land.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—he intends to interrupt a charted destiny—and the choices (emptying, softening, then snapping the crozier; pressing his palm into heat) arise from that drive. The interior contradiction (“stoically sensitive”) plays on the page as careful, incremental risk-taking under pain. Embodied cost is present without melodrama. Only minor hedge: the doctrine/guild pressure stays offstage, limiting relational crucible complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive (“find the beginning in every ending”) drive concrete micro‑choices: discarding assumptions, pressing the hush to the wound, re‑aiming dishes, threading the star fragment. Embodied reactions (“prickled my gums,” steadied hands) and a credible shift from fear to use of the hush show growth under pressure. The renunciation at the end (leaving the hush and star fragment) reads as a costed stance, not a tidy fix. Minor: internal contradiction is present but could bite harder in one peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, character‑bound motive (“tired of losing arrivals”) drives concrete micro‑choices: keeping the radio on, sketching the lattice, instructing the helmsman, and choosing the tide door. Interiority is specific and embodied (broom, dew, humming bulkheads), with a credible contradiction between craving permanence and embracing tidal uncertainty. The captain provides light counterpressure without stealing agency. The final Earned Stasis—remaining a “permanent transient”—reads earned with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Desire is explicit (“discover the texture of connection”) and enacted through concrete micro-choices: anchoring the thread, inviting a visitor, soliciting the curator’s doubt. Interiority arrives in precise, character-particular terms (“buildings exploited trust, and he owed a debt”), giving him moral tension. The curator’s skepticism provides counterpressure without caricature. The visible cost is quiet—renouncing artifacts for habits—but credible at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and embodied motives (the chain link, volunteering for night crawls) guide credible choices under pressure. A subtle contradiction—yearning for starlight while teaching sonar—animates the voice without tidy resolution. The response to the aliens by enacting edge geometry is motivated and revealing. Cost is present in renouncing comforting light for difficult listening, though it remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct, embodied interiority—“listening becomes a structure I can walk through”—grounds motive and micro-choices (searching, walking despite the supervisor, guiding the call). The quiet flaw/virtue pair (compulsive listening vs. curiosity) credibly drives action. Secondary figures press meaningfully without flattening: the man’s grief and the child’s sparrow‑light voice sharpen the narrator’s stakes. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a touch more on-the-spot friction would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is precise and embodied: “counted drips,” “measured the air seam with my lips,” panic against compulsion. Contradictory impulses (claustrophobia vs. compulsion to return and witness) operate simultaneously in action. Micro‑choices under pressure reveal values (risking suffocation, opening the lock, reading names, leaving the charm). The renunciation of the lucky fleck reads as an earned cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation and flaw are crisply embodied: the compulsion to count heartbeats versus the urge to repair produces concrete micro‑choices (scraping frost with the shard, warming the radio, speaking to interrupt counting). The “death certificate error survivor” identity meaningfully pressures her stance with the digital ghost. Emotion is tactile (iron taste, staccato pulse) and contradictions persist through the fix. Slight safety in tidy competence during the technical repair keeps it just shy of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is specific and sustained (to salvage a dying language) and choices under pressure reveal character: climbing to read birds, building listeners, apologizing to the canyon, and paying with a name. Fear of the curse conflicts with duty without neat rationalization. The final renunciation (giving the travel-name, then choosing to stay as caretaker) reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost. A hair more embodied stress at the moment of payment could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (undercover cryptid researcher) and a credible internal tension between “hero” and “keeper” culminate in a chosen surrender. Specific embodied tells (“ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose,” hairs lifting) ground emotion. Micro-choices—pressing the arrowhead to ear, planting it, singing static, accepting being kept—align with the character’s values. The acceptance carries real cost: autonomy traded for stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (to reawaken beauty) under real pressure, with concrete micro-choices: playing “resonantly soft,” adopting the locust mute, and switching to heart‑rhythm signaling. The internal contradiction (longing vs. fear of punishment) is dramatized, not told. Embodied reactions (bow as conductor’s wand; the wrist reach) reveal character under stress. Only minor note: the protagonist achieves a lot with high competence, with limited on‑page stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, specific interiority and a credible “respectfully rebellious” ethic motivate micro-choices (staying with Mina; delivering without proof). Embodied perceptions (“arm hairs rise,” “heart ungoverned”) avoid stock affect. The internal method—“linking absences”—aligns with his ethics and world, culminating in a modest but earned shift. The only limit is the low on‑page cost of defying regulations.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation and method are clear and character‑specific: a “silent carousel carpenter” who listens, fails by force, then risks voice. The internal contradiction (silence vs choosing to sing) lands as a credible cost and change. Embodiment through tactile craft (sanding radii, routing slots) feels lived. Pressure is mild rather than bruising, but the renunciation of silence and vow to tend the train reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, specific interiority—duty-bound curiosity versus yearning—drives micro-choices (stepping into the “saddle of space,” reciting theorems, choosing to return). Contradictory impulses (refusing “shock” yet needing to “reawaken” the path) feel earned and embodied. The renunciation—to return with news rather than stay—lands as a credible cost. Secondary figures apply light pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, specific motivation (escort vs. own the dream) drives concrete micro‑choices: walking the causeways, answering the sea’s price, pressing the shutter, then refusing to turn as the dream brushes past. The internal contradiction—capture through care versus release without possession—stays active in scene. Emotional costs surface in the renunciation and in filing the photographs under Beginnings “knowing they would never be checked out.” The character reads singular and embodied through tool use and sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, urgent motivation (freeing an idea from fear) and embodied interiority (hair/ribbon memory, the tug of combs) earn the shift to singing. The locksmith applies pressure without commandeering agency; the narrator’s micro‑choices (waiting for starlight, speaking promise without words, choosing to sing) reveal values under strain. Contradictory impulses—desire to invite others vs. dread of a “cracked vessel”—coexist credibly. The change at the end—reframing loss as beginning—feels earned with a felt cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent: a hands-on folklorist returns to recover stolen memories. Contradictory impulses surface credibly—the devotion to work over a past relationship becomes the very truth she must sacrifice to the ring. Micro-choices under pressure (mirrors angled, chalked maps, opening the hatch, biting the apple) reveal priority and cost. The partial retrieval and acceptance of limits read as earned change rather than tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—guarding memory and mentoring resilience—manifested in concrete choices (unstoppering the dusk, serving tea, inviting the child to read). Interiority carries character-specific contradictions (combative tenderness, walking backward under stress) with embodied cues like trembling. The relationship with the child sharpens stakes and reveals status dynamics without sentimentality. The exposure of “stubborn kindness” in front of the council registers as a felt cost and credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miren’s motive—to preserve the orchard’s “color of wonder”—is specific and consistently enacted, culminating in surrendering the heirloom seed. Interiority is embodied through sensory craft (sap, scent “like bread learning to rise”). The brief relationship with the child adds pressure and tests her values through teaching and the choice to plant. Internal contradiction is subtle but present in her insatiable urge to create a “new gesture” versus the cost of giving up the locket’s seed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and embodied in concrete micro-choices (unraveling knots, weighing memories with stones, whispering a hymn, choosing the worst-broken mask). Interiority is understated but specific to a craftsperson’s attention and ethics (“never to banish, only to ground”). The caretaker relationship adds gentle pressure without stealing focus. A richer note of contradictory impulse inside the narrator (beyond the laugh/fall beat) could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s “shielded openness” and oath to “interpret silence with empathy” motivate concrete choices (asking for keys, insisting on the village’s presence, framing the map with the tear visible). Interiority is specific and embodied through occupational perception. The cost is quiet but real—a renunciation of spectacle for communal stewardship. Slightly limited internal contradiction under peak pressure keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is precise and embodied: the diver catalogs, copies Morse, taps flakes, answers the current with “two deliberate pulls,” and chooses to take the globe. Contradictory impulses—quiet analysis versus an urge to “mother the past”—coexist in scene. Motivation (to listen, to understand letting go) coheres with micro‑choices and culminates in an Earned Stasis stance. The cost registers as breath/time and the risk of sentiment in removing an artifact, held in a disciplined, character‑specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, embodied motivation—“seldom-heard” yet hired to articulate needs—drives concrete choices (bolting the plate, encoding maps). Interiority is specific (thirst “that had learned to sing quietly”) and consistent with action. Internal contradiction (prior loudness vs. present patience) is present but lightly tested; success comes a bit easily, with limited on‑page cost. Still, choices align with values and reveal a believable, particular self under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (retrieve logbook vs “seek out the joy beneath anguish”) drives concrete micro‑choices: angling goggles for cipher, calming the elevator, opening and then arranging letters without trespass. Contradictory impulses—duty versus gentleness; myth of Mirek versus purposeful detachment—run concurrently. The final vow and curation choice read as an earned renunciation of possessive impulse. Slightly soft cost keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motive (prove absence remembers, memorialize the father) drives concrete choices: naming clouds as tactics, tapping the frame, threading headings “through feeling.” Interiority is specific and embodied through tools and textures (line through fingers, telescope glint). Internal contradiction (science vs. affect) exists but remains low-friction rather than a painful tear, slightly softening impact. The closing renunciation of drift for reconnection reads earned, with a gentle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is vivid and specific (“mirror the sky inside walls”), and prosopagnosia productively shapes perception and choices. Micro-choices under pressure—rubbing the coin, matching arcs to rings, testing pigment, bargaining for “one more minute”—reveal values and limits without tidy moralizing. Internal conflict is quiet (craft vs. clock) but credible; the endurance/readiness at the end feels earned. A touch more contradiction in-the-moment (e.g., a real risk of abandoning the mural) could have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct, embodied voice with concrete motives—diligent curiosity, humility, and professional focus—drives choices (brew, observe, decode, request trust, steer). Internal contradiction is subtle (quiet obedience vs. risky initiative), but present. Agency is consistent and earned; the apprentice’s pattern-reading under pressure reveals character. A slightly greater felt conflict or cost would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he comes “to learn the rhythm of repair”—and his choices (listening, uncapping the bottle, tuning clocks, leaving objects) track cleanly. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (softening gloves, feeling springs), not label-speak. The main limitation is low internal contradiction; his competence faces friction but little visible struggle beyond gentleness under pressure. The closing renunciation (“borrow and never own”) feels earned, with a modest conceptual cost rather than a wrenching one.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    The collective “we” voice carries concrete motive—survival through cohesion—rendered in embodied detail (wind in our teeth, raw hands on cords). Internal contradiction (“hope here is brambled”) lives alongside action, revealing distrust that yields to earned trust. Micro‑choices under pressure (who pairs with whom, when to pull, agreeing to launch) feel motivated by prior beats. The arc is credible endurance toward a communal renunciation of isolation with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—guard and delay doom—and micro‑choices under pressure (filing the bent tooth, adjusting counterweights, choosing to sing) flow from that charge. Contradictory impulses—fatigue and fear versus duty and reverence—coexist on the page (“If you must fail, fail singing”). Embodied interiority is specific (gloves so thin, breath of oil; “bruised awe” under the ribs). The Earned Stasis at the end (waiting with the flawed machine) feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caretaker’s motive (bound duty born of grief) is vivid and consistent, and micro‑choices under pressure (teaching heel‑to‑hollow, coaxing doors) reveal specificity and resolve. Internal contradiction—reluctant yet exacting, obeying while yearning to leave—undergirds the Earned Stasis. Secondary characters are sketched but effective foils that sharpen the caretaker’s role. The felt cost lands when they choose return over escape and accept only a “little” loosening.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is precise and embodied: the chemist reads water as motifs and tests the chrysalis in her palm. Motivation (atonement through redesign) coheres with micro‑choices (tracing foam, naming “Braiding,” vowing to carry the chrysalis). Contradictory impulses (shame vs. resolve; mentor/sister pressures vs. divergence) remain live through the final decision. The visible cost—choosing lawsuits and scorn—grounds the change.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—she sells “beginnings” and seeks the place where stories begin—and her tactics (quantifying absence, offering ledgers and eraser-dust) align. Interiority is particular and embodied through objects rather than anatomy, which keeps it cool and a shade abstract. The trade (ledger of regrets, eraser‑dust, “quiver of my own unfinishedness”) reads as a credible price but the inner contradiction is mild. A touch more friction or risk to her self‑concept under pressure would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is concrete and particular (“mouth full of borrowed thunder”), with a credible contradiction—wanting to transform pain while resisting saviorhood. Micro-choices under pressure (allowing the filament to touch, deciding to cook, recipe choices) reveal values and cost. The relationship with the keeper is spare but forceful, his grief concretized in his handling of the box. The ending’s change (“stood taller…not erased but subsumed”) is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s motive—braiding a siloed town—drives concrete choices (door‑knocking, shared labor, measured downbeat). Interiority is spare but embodied in tactile actions (rope singing through palms). The “empathetically decisive” trait is dramatized by how she orchestrates consent without bulldozing. Limited visible personal cost keeps it shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: the engineer’s “archeologist of abandoned dreams” drive manifests in concrete tactics (kit setup, timed light, breath calibration). Contradictory impulses surface credibly (“calm panic,” fear vs. purpose) and decisions follow character logic. The final renunciation—accepting fragmentation and leaving with “pathways, not trophies”—feels earned by prior beats. Minor note: explicit personal cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—an archivist driven to locate “forgotten combinations”—and choices under pressure (refusing pompous crowns, privileging vigilance) reveal character. Interiority is specific and embodied through unique perception rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (hunger for discovery vs. deliberate restraint), keeping the emotional price quiet. The felt cost is chiefly opportunity/time, not deeply personal harm, which keeps the arc just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (“to create music in a silent world”) drives tactile micro‑choices with embodied attention. The internal turn—renouncing “symphony” for “pulse”—is motivated and costs pride/cleverness credibly. Interiority is specific (bark, rings, pores) rather than label‑speak. The only limit is the low external pressure, which keeps flaws and struggle gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, particular interiority (exile, mercy reframed as stalemate) drives micro‑choices under pressure. The narrator’s surrender and acceptance of judgment show credible endurance with cost. The relationship with the silent girl operates as a crucible via chess and timing rather than dialogue. Slight softness: the narrator’s fear of trespass and social stakes could tighten earlier for maximum torque.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (recover Anya’s work without “wounding” silence) guides concrete, pacifist tactics and small, revealing micro‑choices (refusal to pry, asking permission). The internal contradiction—eclectic pacifist and “reluctant performer of truth”—is dramatized through ritualized performance to the night and restraint with the clasp. Emotional cost surfaces in the inheritance beat (“My throat tightens”) and the double‑signature. Change is modest but earned: from preparer/collector to heir continuing the archive under a vowed ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and persistent (“to cultivate serenity within motion”), and choices under pressure—planting at the bridge heart, enduring the stink, orchestrating drums—align with a specific interiority. Contradictions (ambition vs. stewardship; fear/taboo vs. necessity) are present and resolved credibly. Embodiment through scent and rope/bridge tactility gives her emotions a lived edge. The cost is mostly social and sensory, a touch neat but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, embodied motivation (honoring the grandmother and saving the orchard) drives concrete choices: following the water ribbon, risking the touch, fusing relic to resin, and planting. The narrator’s fear (“heart tight”) coexists with trained competence, yielding credible internal tension. The cost reads as ongoing stewardship and surrendering the relic’s separateness rather than a dramatic wound, but it’s earned. A richer contradictory pull at the spindle (temptation to keep it as trophy vs. duty) could deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, compelling professional motive (“cultivate foresight in action”) threads through concrete micro‑choices (tape, chalk, radio). Interiority is specific and embodied via sensory bias and procedural thought rather than labels. Emotional contradiction is subtle (confidence vs. refusal to “promise”), but the calm competence can read a touch friction‑light under peak pressure. The brief dynamic with the child adds human stakes without diluting the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—“to certify wonder as essential”—and choices align with it through ritualized action. Interiority appears in textured, embodied ways (synesthetic cues, doubt remembering the city), though internal contradiction stays mild rather than deeply pressurized. Micro‑choices (when to strike, when to pause) reveal values under pressure. The sculptor adds responsive pressure, but the relationship isn’t used as a crucible for sharper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clean and compelling—penance through repair—and the narrator’s micro-choices (uncasing the flute, following the rogue note, loosening the weave, laying driftwood) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied (“silence…bruises”; the flute “remembering fingers”). The admission of shortcuts and pride lands as a real flaw confronted. Cost is felt in the refusal of forgiveness and the acceptance of Lane’s irrevocable absence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and textured—she borrows Maris’s manner to bridge courage, then admits using ambiguity as a shield. Micro‑choices (choosing Caslon, calibrating ink with the fragment, “listening as them”) reveal values under pressure. The contradiction between precision (mathematics of emotion) and fear is dramatized, not told. Visible cost arrives when she renounces reliance on Maris’s courage and repositions her ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The courier’s jittery impatience versus the mentor’s stillness method yields concrete, pressured micro-choices (asking the widow to breathe into cupped hands, holding the pitch, letting the corridor close). Interiority is vivid and embodied through sound and touch rather than labels. The widow applies present-tense pressure without becoming a prop. The ending’s acceptance costs the courier an extended miracle and sharpens the mentor-shaped endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mystic’s motive (“to prove that objects absorb emotions”) drives concrete choices—choosing the frost method, aligning the prism, staging a witness. Interiority is specific and embodied (“attention is a candle in windy places”), and the relationship with Mara evolves under pressure. The visible cost lands on Mara’s side (saying the name), with the narrator accepting a disciplined, non‑hedging stance. Minor hedge: the narrator’s internal contradiction (skeptic‑friendly rigor vs mystic poise) is elegantly held but never risks true loss for the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—send a message to her brother—and actions align with cost-bearing tactics (hair, patience, puzzle edges). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“to send herself she must thin herself”), with embodied doubt answered by “she would recommence.” The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned: the loom empties, and she buries the borders. Slight constraint: internal contradiction is present but subtle rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iven’s motives are clear and consistent—“hammering more hope than iron” and risking breath to steady the town—and his choices drive action. Interiority is mostly inferred through externalized vow-work and embodied cost (the bruised wrist), not direct access, limiting complexity. The quiet endurance reads earned, though internal contradiction is minimal. Relationship pressure is communal rather than one-on-one, but it functions.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (smell, pressure, the shard against ribs), with the protagonist making micro‑choices under pressure (tuning the shard, asking the bay, deciding not to erase). The internal contradiction—refusal to forgive or blame, yet acceptance of responsibility—reads credibly. The child’s “cyclically spontaneous” nature functions as a flaw that caused harm. The final stance (keep the record; map for survivors) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and particular; the keeper’s motive to “protect the tender hush” coheres with micro-choices (lighting the candle, stacking stones, writing “We are still here”). Contradictory impulses (ache versus duty) surface without tidy resolution. The brief exchange with the skipper reveals relational texture through restraint. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stance with a felt cost of solitude and ongoing vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline from the first lines (“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) and actions track it: lighting, steering, listening, naming wrecks, adopting and training the child. Interiority is embodied in tactile, professional detail rather than labels (“cheek against green coolness,” “steer silence into shape”). Change reads as Earned Stasis: a costly, lucid commitment to endure and keep guiding. If there’s a gap, it’s the relative gentleness of internal contradiction; the voice rarely wobbles under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (to understand story magnetism post–donor heart) drives specific micro‑choices: mapping light, tilting the wing, and brewing “indigo steam” to protect the widow. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (craft praxis filters emotion). The shift from attraction to disciplined stewardship constitutes an earned renunciation with a felt cost (restraint over capture). Secondary figures apply real pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is precise and particular—repair and witness—and it coheres with the worker’s embodied choices (sweeping dream dust, aligning the sextant, excavating mortar). Interiority is vivid without therapy‑speak; the embarrassment over “quantified sorrow” shows contradiction and cost. Micro‑choices under pressure reveal values (workman’s tools applied to grief). The change reads as earned endurance: a reconfiguration toward measured sorrow and listening.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—to rekindle a dying realm despite being “scattered”—is clear and steadily pressures choices (asking the trees, swaddling grafts, repurposing the window, inviting communities). Contradiction is embodied: a “keeper” whose own seams don’t hold chooses to let others hold. Emotional texture is concrete (“courage fluttered like burlap”) and actions align with an ethic of bound release. Cost lands as relinquishment and shared scars at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and character‑particular, with a credible flaw—empathy as intrusion—driving every choice. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously on the page (urge to flee vs. knees staying; care vs. boundary). The final renunciation—no return to “old shapes”—lands with felt cost consistent with prior motive. Small quibble: a few aphoristic lines lean toward summary wisdom but remain earned by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific—atonement through care—and the narrator’s contradictory impulses (skeptical of absolution yet craving it) act in scene. Micro-choices (gentle pruning vs. conquest; pouring a cup for the absent baker; tucking crumbs and planting seeds) reveal values under pressure. The arrival of the cashier tests stance without theatrics, and the ending commits to ongoing practice with cost (“line thrown from shore I will have to keep holding”). Minor hedge: emotions remain controlled; a sharper moment of jeopardy could have deepened fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation—guarding resonances—intensifies under pressure, culminating in a self-costly vow. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“steady the lantern with mittened hands,” “listening for resonant signatures”). A mild lack of explicit internal contradiction keeps it shy of perfection, but duty-versus-self is felt at the vow. The final renunciation (becoming both entry and keeper) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lark’s motive is precise and embodied in micro‑choices (near‑purchases, gain adjustment, the fob chain loop), with a credible mix of calculation and instinct. Her curiously steadfast patience carries cost in social risk and moral complicity, not just aesthetics. Kettle and the smuggler exert real pressure that crystallizes into the brittle inhale. The only ceiling is that her internal conflict stays coolly managed; a hair more fray under peak stress might deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s skepticism versus receptivity is dramatized in choices (trusting the ring’s tastes, agreeing to walk the final count, accepting to “carry your story”). Embodied interiority via gustatory cues (“citrus when we strayed near impatience”) reveals micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Mirelle applies real pressure without melodrama. The closing renunciation of “alone” reads as earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise and layered: grief, shame, and survival versus the tug of an “inescapable calling.” Her micro-choices—returning after hours, attempting the combination, then inventing a charcoal fix—are consistent with a mnemonic portraitist whose skill set refracts under pressure. The contradiction (tourist smiles vs. subterranean vocation) is dramatized rather than told. The closing commitment to sign with Vera and “rectify the ledger” forecloses the safer, smaller path with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, specific interiority and motive (“candor in small moments”) drive concrete choices: refusing to gild a lie, investigating the map, and halting leaf‑post. The embodied trait (“I wilt near dishonesty”) meaningfully constrains action with cost. Relationship pressure with the postmaster is legible and alters tactics. A touch more contradictory impulse at the brink of the public stand could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iri’s motivation—preserving wonder against the Keepers’ fear-driven filing—is lucid and sustained, with embodied micro-choices (salting bells, angling the shard, refusing via demonstration). Seasonal muteness constrains tactics credibly and adds cost. Her trembling after the concerted refusal feels earned rather than declared. Secondary figures apply real pressure without stealing POV.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and specific—protect the roses and resolve “inner static”—and it tightens under pressure as the pumps flip and the roses overdrink. The contradiction between system‑obedience (“Systems will not allow it”) and the chosen gesture (the illicit mini‑burn) acts in scene. Embodied perception and micro‑choices (“I miniaturize the burn,” “seed it with the moth wing”) reveal values with a modest felt cost. The change at the end reads as earned renunciation toward a new stance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motive (“prove that listening heals”) and a coherent worldview guide choices (cups, locket, waving the crew in). Interiority is vivid and embodied without therapy‑speak. The “lead through following” tension reads as a principled restraint rather than deep contradiction, so the internal cost is subtle. Still, actions align under pressure and reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (liberate the pinned names) and embodied fear/resolve (“cataloging my fear…”) drive micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Mara functions as crucible and method, her touch cueing a pivotal tactic shift. Internal contradiction—wariness versus calm, ritualized action—reads credibly without therapy-speak. The endurance-based “win” feels earned by prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (recovering the sister’s lost laugh) drives concrete choices: consulting the chemist, trespassing to the whale, exhuming the box, and selecting a memory. Interiority is textured and embodied through lantern‑work, gravity’s tug, and the tin of flowers; no stock phrasing. Internal tension (duty to light vs. compulsion to retrieve) is present though understated. The final endurance/realization feels earned, with a quiet cost in risk and trespass rather than a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The summoner’s motive—hushing a coded prophecy—is clear and consistent, with agency enacted through restraint and attention. Interiority is conveyed via embodied listening (“lantern of calm,” “measured breathing”), though internal contradiction remains subtle rather than pressurizing. The choice not to “erase” but to “release” reveals character, yet the cost reads more as discipline than sacrifice. Overall, persuasive and particular, if a touch emotionally buffered.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clean and specific (to learn the building’s language) and actions align, culminating in accepting the seal. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory attention to pipes, timber, and ritual. Internal conflict is subtle—curiosity vs. the ethics of “agreed upon lies”—but not deeply dramatized as struggle. The final renunciation/acceptance (take the seal; “do not be cruel with truth”) lands with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular (“translate isolation into independence”) and drives concrete micro‑choices: tuning to the shell, negotiating one‑way syllables, and accepting the archive. The accept/refuse beat (“To accept was to keep… to refuse was to let the garden keep repeating it.”) cleanly stages an internal conflict. Cost is carried forward as “winter in my chest,” read as responsibility rather than neat catharsis. Slight limit: the flaw set (skepticism vs tenderness) is elegant but narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—she returns not to complete but to forgive—and her choices under pressure (opening the case, writing, then leaving the verdict blank) align with a coherent moral calculus. Interiority is embodied through tools and gestures (the thorn’s kiss, blood as ink). Contradictory impulses—duty to finish vs. mercy through restraint—are present in scene, not summarized. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lio’s motive is clear and particular—an ache to understand why some voices persist—and choices under pressure (testing against longing, using the shell, singing the pot song) expose contradictions (rope-cutter vs knot-maker). Embodied details (ribs as “a small river of feeling,” the “three seconds” of stone refusing to breathe) avoid generic interiority. The culminating vow feels earned because it arises from evidence gathered and a personal cost reckoning (unsent letters, lightly left faces). Minor abstraction edges into thesis once or twice, but never derails the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority with a principled restraint (“I have learned…you must let people see themselves”) that guides tactics under pressure. The narrator’s vocation and empathy drive concrete micro‑choices (decoding taps, diving, inviting witnesses). A live contradiction—urge to shout vs. chosen gentleness—yields earned endurance at the end. Minor distance from visceral fear in the dive keeps it just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is explicit and embodied: the narrator chooses silence, the parapet, the tea ritual, and the gift of the whisk to compel attention to hidden labor. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“demure audacity,” net‑mender philosopher), with gestures that reveal value hierarchy. Mild internal tension between humility and showmanship runs under the demonstration without breaking plausibility. The final relinquishment of the whisk lands as a credible, felt cost consistent with prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear, consistent motive (“conspiracy debunker”) drives concrete choices: noticing the calm, reconstructing letters, teaching calibration, refusing the diamond. Interiority is particular and embodied (“cone of calm… a hush shaped exactly like a prayer”). Slight deficit in contradictory impulses—the narrator rarely doubts or wavers—so the final renunciation carries modest rather than searing cost. Still, endurance and refusal read earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive (“a project and a sin”) and willingness to “install my heart in circuit” create credible, high‑stakes choices, especially accepting the storm’s “baptism.” Brin’s hunger and Knoll’s shifting power sharpen relational pressure without flattening nuance. Interiority is embodied and particular, with contradictions (hubris/penitence) active in scene. The end registers change as communal—earned without betraying the narrator’s flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (“translator between generations”) drives concrete choices: jarring notes, convening the village, and ultimately renouncing lifelong method. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (“holding the air together”), with a credible cost in promising to end the jar‑trade. Internal contradiction—keeper of jars vs. teaching the village to cup its own palms—lands as an earned shift. The widow functions as relational pressure even mostly off‑stage, refracted through the box.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marek’s “logically emotional” ethos drives concrete choices (refusing force, tuning breath, offering the key) with embodied stakes, and the seeker’s hunger reconfigures credibly under pressure. The handover of the key is a sharp character reveal with risk. The one softness: her pivot happens smoothly, with minimal friction, trimming felt struggle. Still, interiority and action align with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (ledgering bone-notes, “unyoking” urgencies), with a credible contradiction between vigilance and restraint. The messenger and the village men apply real pressure that reveals values in action (redirecting them to “softly purposeful” work). Choices align with an earned ethos rather than declaration alone. The endurance at the end reads as an Earned Stasis with the cost of renouncing spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (trembling assignment sheet; breath synced to the tunnel), with credible contradictory impulses: empiricism vs. the lantern’s pressure and supervisor demands. Micro-choices under stress (turning the radios off, turning the lantern’s key, refusing to surrender the lantern) reveal values. The professional stance is consistent yet challenged, and the final renunciation carries plausible cost. A single on-the-nose aphorism (“risk becomes safety only when communities share it”) slightly flattens the otherwise organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chaplain’s motive—translating apology into action for Jonah—drives every choice from seeking repair to reframing counsel. Interiority is precise and embodied through object reactions (the “thorn” mirroring Jonah’s guardedness). He crystallizes a stance at the end (small, chosen steps; rhythm decided by movement) with a felt cost of ongoing, self‑policed effort. Minor note: the chaplain’s own contradiction could be pushed one shade deeper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ilex’s drive (“to ring a bell no one hears yet”) is specific, embodied through iterative micro‑choices (tuning the kaleidoscope, letting the algorithm choose speed, marking the hinge). Interiority is distinct—irreverence and awe coexist as a live contradiction that guides tactics. Emotional cost lands as quiet endurance and the teary denial at the end; it’s subtle but earned. The only limit is that the personal cost remains conceptual rather than materially consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and sustained: the narrator’s compulsion to trace deletions drives every choice. Contradictory impulses crystallize in the legal-vs-voice fork, with a real cost. Interiority is image-rich yet character-specific (flashlight in the drawer, sensed absence). A minor hedge: the narrator’s emotional degradation under stress stays lyrical and composed, never quite fraying.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation (“map empathy onto action”) is embodied through specific, process-driven choices (the mirror method; proposing shared watches and beacon saplings). The narrator’s patience vs. urgency contradiction is dramatized rather than told, with “I did not bring them certainty; I brought them a rehearsal for it.” Emotional cost lands in the commitment to stay a season and shoulder mistrust from both sides. Secondary characters exert precise pressure (Matilde’s ledger, Harun’s scrutiny) that reveals the peacekeeper’s values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, credible internal conflict between a scheduled vanishing and a newly learned vocation of listening; micro‑choices (tapping seams, storm preparation, accepting the whistle) reveal values under pressure. Emotions are embodied through tactile details (parasol tip as “ivory thorn,” boats knocking like knuckles). The delay call at the end reads as an earned renunciation with cost. A slight lyric remove occasionally softens the felt friction of the suicidal impulse, but motivation remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motives and embodied micro-choices (inviting the traveler, producing knife and twine) reveal the sentinel under pressure, while the traveler’s conflicted love vs. self-mapping is credible. The burned letter reveal sharpens characterization with a tangible wound. A slight ease in the traveler’s shift trims complexity, but the cost of the compromise is felt. Distinct voices largely hold, with only mild lyric convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation (to preserve the echo of wisdom) drives concrete choices—guiding, anchoring, asking how, and adopting peripheral attention. Interiority is lyrical but credible, though internal contradiction is minimal and pressure rarely cracks the narrator’s poise. The walker’s reserve and the prophet’s restraint sharpen status dynamics without dialogue clutter. The endurance at the end reads earned, but the felt personal cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive and specific interiority: the “subtle puzzle archivist” frames method and choices, with calm hands offered as a borrowed rhythm. Contradiction lands (perceptively calm vs. an admitted tremble) and informs tactics. Micro‑choices (circle, mirror reveal, route test, refusal of the ride to face ruins) feel coherent. Relationship pressure is light but credible (the mayor’s deference and communal need), enough for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scholar’s motive—decode growth and assemble a testimony—is clear and coherent with his reticence. Embodied details (paper‑nicked hand, “where pages fought back”) ground interiority. A live contradiction (“He hates to speak, but he loves to hear”) culminates in a choice to “testify by playing,” an earned renunciation of conventional speech. The cost is subtle but felt rather than theatrically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Desire and tactics are precise and character‑particular: chalk circles, ear to iron, driftwood compass, speaking into welded lips. The flaw—precognitive forgetfulness—actively constrains choices and drives him to create future aids. Emotional texture is embodied (listening with the thin bones of his wrists; salt counting him). The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting forgetting, asking only for accompaniment) reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character-particular interiority grounded in tactile craft; the narrator’s patience and listening ethos drive every micro‑choice. The internal tension—certainty versus humility—surfaces credibly in “Noise is not always error” and the later vow to “unlearn” silence. Actions (rebalancing, muting, sanding) align with motive under pressure. The cost is subtle but legible as endurance and renunciation rather than dramatic sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The therapist’s motives and micro‑choices are precise and embodied (peeling the clementine, dialing the son, modulating the hymn). The father and son each reveal layered contradictions through action and subtext (“be here and going,” shard as careful joy). The therapist borders on idealized—conflict within her is minimal—but her decisiveness under pressure reads earned. The shard transfer registers a credible endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motive is precise and persistent (“to find where shadows go at noon”), and their “quietly deliberate” temperament governs tactics (mirrors, shutters, rune). Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic, filtered through a rune‑scholar’s lexicon. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; cost appears as consenting to a binding (“the line slipped under my skin”), not heavy emotional rupture. The endurance/renunciation feels credible at this scale, though a sharper on‑page struggle would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s “forgiving skeptic” contradiction is dramatized through micro‑choices: following Linnet, pocketing the tooth despite doubt, and choosing mercy while setting Ari’s shoulder. Embodied emotion runs through craft‑accurate bone‑setting and the ache of repairs at the end. Ari’s shame and endurance feel lived rather than summarized. The final renunciation—tell it plain, not witch/river tales—forecloses a path with social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystal: to share light without fire, rooted in the brother/fire backstory and a village’s trauma. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (“I set the oval on my tongue...”), not labels. The internal contradiction—longing for a star vs. choosing patient earthbound methods—is present but gentle rather than pressurized. Final endurance/renunciation reads earned, with cost in labor and refusal of blaze.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is lucid and embodied: the narrator seeks to “graft new meaning onto old wounds,” enacting that aim through mapping, proffering, and burial. Contradictory impulses—hurt vs. generosity—surface in “I am not an arena” alongside the choice to return and inter the pendant. Status and consent dynamics (“May I,” “You kept it”) are sharply negotiated without neat absolution. The renunciations (“no art from me,” “no silence from you”) land as earned endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied through recurring objects and tactile choices (wading in; the shell’s “pocketed star”). The central motive—resisting the market’s “tidy raft”—drives credible renunciation at the end. Contradictory impulses (yearlong resistance vs. desire for a pact) act on the page. Slight abstraction in a few lines (“arranging permission”) mutes the felt cost a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is present (doubt softening; the final understanding that “repair is sometimes just remembering together”), but the POV mostly observes Rowen’s agency rather than facing a pressured, contradictory choice. Motivation—restore sacred practices—is clear and consistent, with embodied touches (throats polished, jars warmed by breath). The internal conflict is gentle and lacks a sharp micro‑choice under stress. The final shift reads earned but low‑cost, tilting more toward acceptance than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—“to translate heartbeats into maps” for others when the sky won’t move—and actions align with it across beats. Embodied patience under cold pressure reads as a character trait with cost (frosted lashes, conserving starlight). The sister memory adds a human stake without derailing the present. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; endurance more than conflict carries the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—he wants to “store wonder in the cellar of reason”—and his choices (repairing, mapping, placing, then leaving the timer) align with that drive. Interiority is embedded in tactile work rather than abstract labels, with strong craft-specific perceptions. Internal contradiction is subtle (collector vs. renouncer), yet present in the final choice to leave the timer behind. The struggle is mostly technical and contemplative; emotional cost is quiet but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystal clear from the opening and deepens credibly as the vow meets the practice of weighing griefs. Interiority is particular and embodied (“saltshaken hand,” “ledger of bone”) and the fear revealed near dawn complicates the stated aim. The micro‑choices—asking permission, adjusting stance, naming weights—show values under pressure. Slight neatness in the final acceptance keeps a hair of ambiguity cost from cutting deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is concrete and choice-driven: she refuses to sand the knot, carves a collar rather than a lion, leaves the keepsake tin shut, and decides not to restore the scuffed name. Contradictory impulses—repair versus faithful absence—act in the moment (“absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness”). Micro‑choices track to a value hierarchy of restraint, trust, and ritual. The final renunciations feel earned by prior acts of careful containment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—“to negotiate with my own ghost”—and every choice (climb, bait with stories, pay in verbs, stay) aligns under rising pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with embodied contradictions (a scavenger who must stop scavenging the future). The renunciation at the end (“I stay…”) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor reservation: emotional states skew lyric over visceral at times, but not enough to blunt credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—an unpaid, “functionally creative” intern determined to engineer hope—and actions align concretely (rerouting water, power, air). Interiority is specific and embodied through tools and tasks rather than abstractions. The janitor’s presence adds relational texture without diluting the protagonist’s agency. The change is credible but quiet, with cost framed as ongoing maintenance rather than a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is specific and embodied: barefoot letters on soles, cheek to glass, a ledger of afternoons. The contradictory impulses—hunger for a city of bells vs. fear/shame—coexist on the page and culminate in an earned renunciation-without-rejection. Micro-choices (vow to write no clocks, apology, closing the ledger) reveal values under pressure. The final stance forecloses one path (rebuilding) with a felt cost while honoring tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and sustained—salvage the box to expose the city’s self‑mythology—and actions align (the retrieval, reading, and meeting). Interiority is textured and embodied (“lantern glass polished by rain”), with a credible tension between radical correction and disciplined calm. Personal cost arrives via family complicity (“my father had worked the locks”) that reweights the discovery. The final stance—serene upheaval rather than roar—reads as an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive: to preserve ancient methods through rope reading and seed care. Micro‑choices under pressure (easing the splice, humming to let rhythm loosen time, choosing translation over unmaking) reveal values. Internal contradiction is quiet (patience vs non‑passivity) but credible and enacted rather than declared. The arc resolves as Earned Stasis with felt cost in time and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation and vocation shape every move; the narrator’s empathy and “clerk of explained absences” stance feel earned and embodied. Internal contradiction is subtler—duty versus the bodily cost of crossing that “bridge of presence”—but not deeply contested on the page. The intimacy with the client at the fountain reveals character under pressure. The final act (looping the thread on the woman’s wrist) credibly forecloses a path of denial.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied motive (repair over conquest) with tactile micro‑choices (scavenging, tuning, fasting) and an earned renunciation at the end. Interiority is vivid and particular to this prince’s sensibility. The weakness: opposition is soft (engineers and librarians largely assist), so contradictory impulses under pressure are felt but not fiercely tested. The final caretaking stance feels earned, with an implied social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rich contradiction (arsonist’s daughter/firefighter) drives credible, compassionate choices: she refuses to scold the boy, invokes her father to read the wind, and sacrifices the coin’s thread to bind the graft. Interiority is specific and embodied (sand as ballast, coin as pendulum), not label‑speak. The final stance—becoming “the opposite of a fuse”—reads as earned renunciation with felt cost. Minor note: pressure remains gentle, so struggle is more spiritual than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ilias’s motive—liberate trapped memories—drives consistent, goal‑aligned choices, with his refusal of the broker’s “quick flood” showing values under pressure. Interiority is conveyed through perceptual bias and precise acts (“I doubt as a way to listen”) rather than summary. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (skepticism paired with faith in slow method), with limited on‑page turmoil. The visible cost is time and foregone relief, credibly accepted as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, coherent interior drive—“to share light without using fire”—animates specific choices (tuning the garden, triggering the petal‑rain, giving the gear to the child). Contradictory impulses surface credibly (“heirloom pretending to be alive” versus active stewardship). Emotional embodiment stays character‑particular through tools and textures rather than labels. Cost reads as ongoing vigilance and renunciation rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The carver’s motives and micro-choices are clear and specific, from measuring “breath and silence” with the ribbon to inviting the father to choose a notch. The restraint vs. ornament tension—policed by the mother’s hush—creates live internal conflict. Embodied emotion appears in tactile actions (shallow cuts, then deeper as the father steadies). The endurance-based change (accepting spareness as cost) is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation and interior conflict are precise and felt: the winder’s shift from rigid precision to ethical listening is embodied in micro‑choices (holding the pause, loosening, offering the handle). The grief backstory informs present tactics without derailing the scene. One line edges toward thesis‑speak (“Precision without regard becomes injury”), but it’s supported by concrete action. The final renunciation of correction with the fisherman lands as a credible, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“discover the shape of intentions”) and distinctive traits (“tenderly organized,” blithe yet shadowed) drive concrete micro‑choices: waiting out the clock, tapping the case, decoding knots, apologizing to asters. Internal tension is present but gentle; discoveries arrive a bit smoothly without much resistance. Still, the embodied actions under pressure reveal character credibly. The final stance shift (from blitheness to respect) feels earned by what he learns.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and particular: the “ignorance cartographer” holds a credible tension between generative curiosity and duty-bound constraint. Micro-choices (tower/burrow/canal, then “a hinge”) reveal values under pressure with a felt cost (fear of misuse vs. stewardship). Embodied perception (ice groans, beads migrate) grounds emotion. The resolve to choose hinges reads earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The copyist’s motive—teaching dust to speak—drives each concrete micro‑choice (tuning, cloaking the glow, tapping time, promising). Interiority is specific and embodied through occupational habits (barlines, rests, onionskin, spider‑thread slurs). Contradiction is quiet but present: hunger to animate dust versus caution and pace (“give the dust its tempo”). The earned renunciation is ongoing stewardship and secrecy, with a felt cost of vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is vivid and layered: the narrator needs the mother’s blessing yet chooses to “work without asking permission,” revealing a core contradiction. Interiority remains embodied and specific (ash, resin, letters) rather than abstract. Micro‑choices—taking the letters, refusing placards, placing the chair—track to values under pressure. The final reciprocal witnessing with the mother lands as earned stasis with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is precise and consistent: the narrator preserves methods over myths and acts accordingly under time pressure. The internal pull—“the reflex to agonize over the least harmful lie”—gives way to disciplined choice, revealing a credible hierarchy of values. Embodied, character‑particular perception (chalk marks, silt “like sleeping whales”) grounds emotion without therapy‑speak. Micro‑choices (keep the cog; lead them now; wedge and wind) align to the stated ethos with a felt social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive and contradictions are vivid: “stubborn practice rather than effortless gift,” “expectantly resigned yet offering breath.” Micro-choices (placing the rosette between Rafi and Ola, denoting rests, passing the pencil) reveal values under pressure. Secondary portraits (Rafi, Ola, Jin) are specific through sonic signatures and behavior. The change—shouting to listening, hostility to shared cadence—reads earned with a felt cost of relinquished judgments.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent (to “create something beautiful from the ruins”), and micro-choices—planting despite the ordinance, spitting the greenhouse’s memory, pruning with intention—reveal values under pressure. Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“handled flavors like confessions”; laughter kept quiet not to “scare” the sprout). A gentle-defiance flaw/virtue drives risk without false heroics. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper felt cost to the self might have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s involuntary candor and devotion to ritual motivate concrete choices: enforcing the riddle, revealing the hidden tray, and opening the box despite reluctance. Contradictory impulses—preserving wonder vs. urgency—surface in “truth pinned my tongue and freed my hands.” Emotional texture is embodied through tactile, olfactory cues (smoke, stormfruit, lacquer whisper). The cost is subtle but real: surrendering the guarded object and control to Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive and method drive concrete micro‑choices (placing the shard, reading displacements, leaving lavender, returning the beetle tin). Interiority is idiosyncratic and embodied through sensory noticing rather than labels. The final conceptual shift feels earned by action, though the on‑page cost is subtle rather than searing. Contradictory impulses are muted but present as care vs. judgment (“sanctify me… if I have read you falsely”).

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Oris’s motive—to welcome nuance into certainty—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (threading eelgrass, breaking the ampoule). The telepathic link with the scholar provides credible counterpressure, revealing Oris’s steadiness under doubt. Emotional texture is embodied via aquatic mechanics rather than labels. The conflict skews contemplative, so felt personal cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is vivid and particular (“grim optimist… balancedly daring”), with concrete micro‑choices under pressure: rolling biased dice, chalking lemmas, refusing the rupture. The contradictory impulses (to preserve and to progress) act simultaneously at the crack. The renunciation—choosing not to step through—reads as an earned endurance with felt cost. Reactions to key objects (the chipped die, chalk, apertures) reveal a coherent, flawed, self‑aware stance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is precise and embodied (rouse a stalled canvas/doubting heart; prove strangers remember kindness), with tactile micro-choices (moonlit brush, gold dot). Interiority is specific to Lina’s insomnia and craft, not generic. The contradiction—restless wakefulness vs methodical hope—registers, though it rarely sharpens into a live dilemma under pressure. The neighbor’s arrival adds relational charge without destabilizing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guide’s motive—rescuing dying arts—translates into concrete, pressured choices (inventing the bread-initials ritual, wielding the lens, leading the waterfall test). Interiority is vivid and specific (“nectar armor, sweet and unbearable”) with a credible flaw: the “historically oriented” compulsion that risks embalming rather than nursing. Relationship dynamics with Senka are legible and shift as responsibility is transferred. If anything, the protagonist’s competence smooths struggle slightly, reducing visible cost mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystal: the clockmaker seeks to “step beyond fate’s design,” and contradictory impulses (hunger vs. human tie to the keeper) act simultaneously in scene. Embodied particulars—brass, pitch, blood—ground interiority. The final renunciation is earned by prior setup (the keeper’s silence, the threads’ costs). Minor lyric grandness skirts melodrama but stays character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, pressure‑sharpened motivation (“to trick fear into revealing its weakness”) and embodied interiority (“I am afraid that I do not exist unless someone is looking”). The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—craving attention as solvent while fearing being edited by it—are dramatized rather than told. Micro‑choices (using the clasp, feeding paradox into the dictionary, admitting the core fear) reveal hierarchy of values. The advisor adds live pressure, though the protagonist pays limited on‑page cost beyond confession.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular motive—“turn obstacles into instruments”—drives every choice, and embodied perception (hearing D in the clouds, tapping timbre) reveals character under pressure. Competence feels earned through tactile actions (mallet, crates, dubbing), and fear flickers (“eyes bright with fear and rehearsal”). Internal contradiction is lighter; the narrator rarely falters or errs. The endurance at the end reads credible but low‑cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied: hunger and the mother’s absence funnel into a string of micro-choices (freezing at the crack, slipping on the tag, sounding each note, stepping into glare). Interiority is specific to a “spiral-shell cartographer” who reads world-patterns rather than abstractions. The key tension—warn the city vs. follow the lattice—is live at the peak and resolved with cost. A hairline note: the internal contradiction is present but could tighten one more notch before the final step.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and rooted in the “emotionally rational” temperament; the choice to publish and deliver the ledger is earned by findings and reflection. Contradictory impulses—mercy’s mask vs. light—coexist and are tested on the page. Micro-choices (opening lockers, copying names, framing “Listen”) reveal values with cost. The endurance stance at the end feels credible and forecloses the path of “noble lies.”

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    A singular, coherent interiority blends rigor and tenderness; “Stoically sensitive” is enacted through careful, unspectacular work. Micro‑choices under pressure (wresting the door, threading a line, retrieving the program, tucking notes into mortar) reveal a hierarchy of values. The internal paradox (firmness as a way to hold trembling) is dramatized, not merely stated. The quiet renunciation of recognition at the end reads as earned endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ossa’s motives and method—“a method of gentle suspicion”—are specific and drive all micro‑choices (waiting for the blackout, selecting documents, stamping evidence). Interiority is embodied (“pages dry like leaves,” “the way a promise leans”) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is subtle (tender reverence for the archive vs. ruthless testing of myths), not dramatic. The final renunciation—hiding the stamp near the registrar’s journals—reads as Earned Stasis with a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—retrieve/relieve the loss of his shadow by crafting grief into cranes—and every choice (polishing, lens‑fitting, offering) aligns under pressure. Embodied emotion is expressed through tactile craft (“roughness scratches what should be cradled”), avoiding therapy‑speak. The final acceptance—ache loosens though the shadow doesn’t return—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is muted; he rarely wavers in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    A singular, embodied interiority drives the piece: the survivor’s technical acuity braided with trauma (“a purple cathedral under skin”) yields clear motive and micro‑choices (drift 3 meters, run the sequence, send the dare). Contradictory impulses—grief vs. “bleak exhilaration,” secrecy vs. reporting—coexist in scene rather than as summary. The vow to “remain awake” reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (pain, vigilance, ethical hush). Relationship pressure is minimal (the commander is off‑stage), but the absence suits the solitary crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear desire (to “chart the sky” for belonging) drives concrete choices: pulling the dome, launching drones, soldering the cradle, and crucially reinterpreting blanks as rests. Interiority is specific and embodied through image (“cameras drink photons and doubt”), with a credible relational crucible in the pilgrim’s presence. The change—eyes “calibrated for kindness”—is earned by prior acts of attention. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but it forecloses the old finding-vs.-tuning paradigm.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s flaw (cowardice monetized as “protection”) drives every turn, and his micro-choices—going to the shore, confessing, offering the archives, keeping one page—show contradictory impulses in tension with credible cost. Embodied perception (“gulls stitched small commas”) and object‑reactions (the watch hand) reveal him under pressure. The relationship with Mara functions as crucible; her tempered response reorients his self‑story without absolving him. The renunciation at the end (burning the archive but keeping Abel’s page) is earned and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority with concrete micro‑choices under pressure: the negotiator sets terms (“no horns...”), shows the drawer pull to the conscript, and reframes the snag with the brass’s “two stories.” Secondary figures (Raglen, Della) are sketched with efficient, telling actions. The arc lands as Earned Stasis—holding neutrality at cost—without neat moral smoothing. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is present but could bite harder at the snag.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, embodied interiority—guilt, avoidance, and need for repair—drives micro‑choices, especially the pivot to help the boy despite shame. Contradictory impulses act in scene (avoid open ocean vs. answering the call). Actions align with motive and culminate in a credible Earned Stasis (“broken but working”). A hair shy of perfect only because the self‑awareness is impeccably articulated, verging on curated.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and pressurized: the narrator seeks to counter engineered indifference and test their post-procedure self. Contradictory impulses—escape vs. responsibility—surface in the choice to stay and ferry. Embodied guilt and wariness register physically (“eyes watered as if guilt returned as steam”). The final renunciation (foregoing a clean exit) reads earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is vivid and specific: to reforge a bond with Mira. Interiority balances tenderness and fear, especially around the “coin” of metamorphosis and the loss of voice. Contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page (reluctance vs. devotion) and resolved through a costly choice. Embodied details (ribs, thumbs, scent-work) keep emotion grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline (atonement for lost maternal moments), and actions track it through concrete ritual. Interiority is vivid and particular, with contradictions (guilt and “choking beauty”) acting simultaneously. The renunciation of prediction (“I did not ask the cards when I would fail again”) reads as an earned endurance with cost. Minor note: no interpersonal friction on-page limits relationship crucible, but the absent child still exerts strong pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is precise and consistent (open the lock without violence), and tactics arise from traits (joy/grief weight, pacifism). Contradictory impulses operate in scene: she must “push” while refusing harm, calibrating buoyancy instead of forcing. Embodied emotion (boots kiss the deck; hinges scream) keeps interiority concrete. The final pledge to unseal only what can be tended is an earned renunciation with cost (self‑limitation and ongoing solitude).

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—to redirect panic through “useful kindness” and listening—drives all choices, and her embarrassment about prophecy adds credible inner friction. She adapts tactics (lantern arc, rib-listening, safe ridge) under pressure. Secondary figures apply relevant, specific pressure (tide, tremor tempo) without stealing focus. The final renunciation—releasing the bugs and refusing mythic credit—lands as earned endurance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clean and consistent—using the blackout to “spark a silent revolution”—and actions align (sundial reading, quill‑holder lockwork, regulator tuning). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, though internal contradiction is muted; the narrator remains highly competent under pressure. The relationship with Fara is warm but functional; the real crucible is the quick turn with Rhun. The final stance shift—“guarding consent instead of fear”—lands, but the visible cost is light.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motives are vivid and consistent (the vow “burning in my ribs”) and deepen under pressure toward the acceptance of becoming part of the pattern. Contradictory impulses surface credibly—fear vs. vow (“swallowing fear like a thin blade”), wanting to argue vs. the “arithmetic of mercy.” The eel herder’s sacrifice is earned by her curse and prior choices, reconfiguring the narrator’s role. Interiority remains embodied rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motivation (“to understand the cartography of scars”) fuels concrete micro‑choices: climbing, pressing/stopping the timer, reciting the forbidden poem, and asking about the ash‑drawn constellation. Interiority is embodied (“thumb hovering… as if above a pulse”; fear thinning into clarity). The “furiously tranquil” stance operates as a credible contradiction under pressure. Slight idealization remains—the poet’s flaws are more implied by censorship than dramatized—but the arc earns its stance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—turning questions into destinations—drives concrete choices (needle alignment, fencing tactics, blocking Rook at the map) and culminates in the decision to enter. Interiority is specific and embodied (“even my stillness sounded argumentative”), with competence balanced by a conceptual risk in leaving. Status dynamics with Liese and Rook shift credibly from opposition to treaty. Only minor abstraction at peak beats keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rich, specific interiority and concrete micro‑choices (opening the tin’s false bottom, reading pennies aloud) reveal a coherent, urgent motive balanced by the flaw/pressure of monthly molting. The relationship with Lio is lived‑in and functional under pressure, with status playing through action rather than talk. Emotional contradiction is present (fervor vs. fear of becoming a stranger). The end’s endurance stance feels earned, though the cost remains more conceptual than bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motivation—“surprise fate with an unplanned encore”—drives specific choices: threading the reel, climbing, letting the compasses modulate his playing. Interiority is embodied via musicianly perception (“keys still ringing… like tethered birds”) and a live contradiction (loving timetables yet defying them). Micro‑choices under pressure read credibly (moving when needles hum, waiting when they twitch). The felt price is subtle—risking disruption and investing belief—so the cost could press harder on the body or relations.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystal—protect the island’s cultural memory—and the narrator’s “luminous doubt” creates a credible internal tension that sharpens choices. Micro-choices (following dream signs, testing at sunrise, planting, reciting the charter) reveal a hierarchy of values. The embodied cost registers in the relinquishment of centrality: “The island no longer needed me to waken it.” Emotional texture is rich, though the struggle remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and character-particular: a bonsai tutor seeking the color of unspoken apologies. Contradictory impulses—obedience as fear vs. the need to speak—surface in “obedience is the way fear pretends to be careful.” Interiority is embodied through bonsai and maritime tools; the final renunciation (“pruning only what asked”) reads earned with visible cost. Minor note: the “one who mattered” remains abstract, but the lack of name serves the piece’s lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with a tightly integrated interiority and motivation. Her professional lens as a neutron star researcher provides a unique and consistent filter for her perceptions, turning a mundane cleanup task into a scientific observation. The internal conflict between her old "flamboyant" methods and the new, patient approach required by the flood is dramatized through her micro-choices, like sweeping slowly and studying dust patterns. The final shift to a modest, observational plan is fully earned and lands with the quiet force of a genuine epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation and interiority are exceptionally well-drawn and consistent. The voice is deeply rooted in the character's profession, with choices and perceptions filtered through the lens of a glass artist (e.g., the "annealed" answer). The internal conflict between direct action and artistic justice is compelling, and the final choice is a perfect, earned expression of the character's stated value of being "steadily adaptive," demonstrating the trait rather than just labeling it.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established immediately and remains the unwavering core of the story. The interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, particularly in the contrast between remembered trauma and the current "practice of staying." The final earned stasis, which re-contextualizes survival as a form of art, is both credible and moving, demonstrating a change earned through on-page action and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The undertaker's motivation is established with poetic precision and held with unwavering consistency. His weariness and stubborn sense of duty are not just stated but embodied in his actions, culminating in an earned transformation from a hired professional to a permanent keeper. The line "grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry" provides a profound, character-specific anchor for his choices, making the final act of devotion feel inevitable and deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly for Mara, who is established with a potent metaphor ("a tide that returned") and consistently demonstrates her core trait of gentle persistence. Her motivation is clear and her actions, especially the calm defiance during the climax ("They do not exist as persons"), are earned and powerful. The narrator's shift from observer to designated archivist of "exchanges" provides a subtle but meaningful arc, fulfilling the 9+ standard of an earned change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a motivation that is both abstract and deeply felt. The internal conflict between the past self (hoarder of light) and the present self is dramatized through the specific actions of the camera obscura and breathwork. The final change feels earned, a direct result of a conscious internal choice, "let us heal what we hoarded," which pays off with the unlatching behind the ribs and the connection with the stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to understand time is abstract but powerfully grounded in the specific trauma of the library fire. Interiority is rendered with exceptional, particular detail ("soot learned to speak in my breathing"). The final earned stasis, accepting a difficult truth about grief and memory, is a compelling character resolution that feels earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The central contradiction of "chained liberator" is beautifully sustained, reflected in her "staggering grace." Her motivation is clear and embodied in every choice, from the patient puzzle-solving to the swift improvisation against the enforcers. The final image of her carrying her vow ("vows weigh best when carried") provides a powerful, earned closure on her character's enduring state.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is established immediately and evolves from a reactive desire ("find the sound of trust breaking") to a proactive, generative purpose. The interiority is stunningly specific and embodied through the synesthesia ("Blue is a far drum"). The final change, shifting from seeking the fracture to preserving the whole, is earned through the on-page creation and testing of the listening bowl, representing a profound and credible internal transformation with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is established with a compellingly poetic but grounded goal, and their internal conflict regarding their craft is resolved through a powerful external encounter. The shift from a romanticized "thief" to a responsible "keeper" is earned through the mentor's failure and the subsequent act of restoration. The mentor, though appearing briefly, is rendered with precise, painful detail ("a lake's worth of unspent horizon"), creating a crucible that forces the protagonist's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his contemplative nature. The interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in the way he ritualizes ordinary tasks. A slight weakness is that his self-reminders, such as "Safeness is not a wall...", verge on being overly articulate, approaching thematic summary rather than raw internal conflict, but his actions ground these thoughts effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and interiority is well-embodied, particularly the use of fear as a tool ("Fear could be a lever, not a lock"). The arc from phobia-ridden double to a man "honest enough to tremble" is earned. The score is capped from the 9+ band by the tendency to state thematic motives ("I wanted to prove that vulnerability is power") directly, which reads as diagnostic self-awareness rather than an in-the-moment impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characters, while archetypal, are rendered with powerful consistency. The oracle's motivation is clear, and the courier's transformation from skeptical messenger to custodian of a new faith is earned within the story's lyrical logic. His micro-choice to tear a strip from his sleeve is a perfect physical manifestation of his internal shift. The only minor friction is the description of the oracle as "mildly obsessed," which slightly understates the profound, world-shaping commitment she demonstrates.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.7)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a distinct and compelling voice from the first line. The narrator's internal state—the conflict between programmed "composure" and the "hesitation" that leaves streaks—is masterfully embodied through its relationship to its work. The final earned stasis feels inevitable and true to the character's journey, particularly in the line, "Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears," which perfectly encapsulates the robot's emergent consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation is clear and compelling, and the internal conflict between cowardice and responsibility drives the plot. The final choice feels earned. A minor flaw is the slightly diagnostic self-assessment "I am also a coward, learning to be freed by honesty," which tells the theme rather than purely embodying it in a peak moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in the desire "to prove that gardens know their gardeners." Interiority is rendered with specific, poetic grit ("sunburned me into string and grit"), and his contradictory impulses—pragmatism versus ritual, deception versus honesty—act simultaneously in the climax. The final shift from being "luck's apprentice" to an equal partner with the garden is earned through the costly on-page act of confession.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Jae’s character is rendered with exceptional consistency and depth for this length. His core motivation—proving his theory—is established early and drives every action, culminating in a choice that feels both inevitable and earned. The final beat, where the proof arrives as a private "affection," provides a sophisticated internal closure that surpasses a simple intellectual victory, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned change with a felt, personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    The musician's interiority is concrete and specific, with a consistent voice and clear motivation ("I came to unravel the code"). The final choice to conduct the silence is earned through a sequence of obedient, curious actions. However, the character's deeper, personal reasons for being there remain unexamined, making them a beautifully rendered lens for the atmosphere rather than a character with compelling internal contradictions acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation is established immediately with visceral interiority (“calcifies behind my sternum,” “small stone star”), and their emotional progression from seeking absolution to accepting balance is earned and convincing. The oracle, while archetypal, is rendered with specific, purposeful actions that drive the narrative. The final change is profound and feels inevitable, earned through the crucible of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear and his core contradiction—a skeptic who trusts only steel yet uses psychic radio data—is dramatized perfectly. The internal conflict between his methodical approach and his profound need for a non-scientific answer is embodied in his actions, not just stated. The final earned stasis, where he accepts the physical weight of truth over a supernatural one, is a powerful and credible character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is clear and consistent, providing a strong core for this meditative piece. The internal conflict is palpable when the narrator feels their "judgments loosen like old laces" after contemplating the world above. However, the characterization remains somewhat archetypal, serving more as a lens for the atmosphere than a fully-realized individual with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure scene; the transformation is a deepening of a pre-existing state rather than a sharp, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly for Ada, who is rendered with profound depth through her relationship to a single object. Her grief is embodied in the guarding of the locket, and her subtle shift toward openness is earned and powerfully conveyed. The narrator’s interiority is consistent and specific, balancing professional observation with genuine empathy. The final change in Ada—her breath steadier, her request for the lullaby—is a masterclass in showing a character’s internal reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    The historian's motivation is established early and provides a powerful, consistent engine for the entire narrative. His core trait of being "sensitively perceptive" is demonstrated through his actions and perceptions, not just stated. The final choice to "volunteer" is a profound and earned evolution of his initial wish, moving from passive archivist to active participant in the world's new grammar. The line "He is not lonely so much as porous" is a masterful piece of concrete, character-specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is established early and provides a powerful, consistent drive. Interiority is exceptional, avoiding cliché and articulating a unique worldview through lines like "I have always been accidentally prophetic, which sounds glamorous until you live among your own punchlines." The relationship with the keeper is rendered with superb economy, establishing deep history through shared cigarettes and subtext-laden dialogue. The final choice is a direct and earned consequence of the narrator’s stated desire to move from accidental misdirection to purposeful arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization of Father Ilario is exceptional, defined by his unique craft rather than exposition. His motivation is clear, and his internal state is shown through his precise, deliberate actions. Mara's transformation is earned, moving from passive vessel to active agent in the final beat. The husband's mundane perspective provides an effective, subtle grounding that heightens the strangeness of the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation—resolving a state of being "chronologically homesick"—is both unique and deeply felt, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. Interiority is rendered with exquisite, character-particular detail ("stranded between tenses, aching for the exact tempo of a vanished noon"). The final shift from an active conductor to a receptive listener is an earned change, representing a profound internal resolution that forecloses the path of forceful recreation in favor of attentive grace.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is potent and sustained, with a clear internal contradiction between defiance and acceptance that drives the narrative. Interiority is rendered with unusual specificity, avoiding cliché; the concept of being "periodically eternal" justifies the character's weary, philosophical self-awareness. The final choice to lower, not rise, is a perfectly earned renunciation, grounded in the story's established logic and carrying the palpable cost of surrendering a core identity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is viscerally established and her internal journey is compelling. The characterization is strong, particularly in its embodiment of sensation. A minor deduction is for the moment of slightly too-perfect self-awareness near the end ("yet she had already stopped without noticing"), which feels more like an authorial summary than an earned, in-the-moment realization and slightly undercuts the subtlety of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation to "nurture integrity" and "refuse poor maps" is not just stated but serves as the direct engine for every tactical choice, from the decoy charts to the lateral escape. Internal conflict is rendered with poetic precision in lines like "Serenity and threat balanced like two needles," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice is a perfect, earned expression of a character whose entire being is tuned to their craft.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core conceits. The narrator's profession and internal state are fused in the opening lines, creating a compelling, specific voice. The internal conflict between the hunger for understanding and the terror of the memory is dramatized with visceral, embodied reactions, culminating in a credible and moving transformation. The final earned epiphany feels like a natural outgrowth of the preceding struggle, not a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation that is earned and deepened by the story's climax. The protagonist's internal conflict between a heroic self-image and a flawed past is revealed with powerful subtlety. The final choice to "braid" his past into his present represents a meaningful, earned change. The explicit vow is a minor slip toward thematic summary but is mostly justified by the poetic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator’s motivation to “unbind the silence” is established immediately and drives every action with unwavering consistency. Interiority is rendered in a distinct, lyrical voice that feels earned rather than asserted, particularly in the philosophy of unfinished songs. The dialogue with Lark serves as a perfect, gentle crucible, forcing the narrator to articulate their worldview, which in turn catalyzes the story's resolution. The final micro-choice to exchange the marble for the shell with Lark embodies the theme of shared, simple obligations, making the abstract concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's voice is a masterclass in establishing a complex worldview—professional, cynical, yet deeply invested—from the first sentence. Rhea's motivation is rendered with specific, poetic precision, and her transformation from a state of anxious analysis to one of embodied calm is credible and moving. The internal contradiction in the narrator, wanting both professional detachment and a genuine transformation for the client, is beautifully resolved in the final, self-aware admission: "I wanted, against my habit..."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict—"recognition can be risky"—is stated rather than dramatized, resolving with little on-page struggle. The characters read as compelling archetypes for this fable-like narrative, but their interiority lacks the specific, contradictory impulses expected in top-tier work. The friendship between Mara and Jun is asserted ("snapping open like sails") more than it is earned through scene-level interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "graft" onto a community is clear and powerfully rendered through a specific, earned internal arc. The shift from wanting to build an object to dedicating a practice is a sophisticated change. The interiority is distinct and evocative, though the self-assessment "I am boldly sympathetic, a flaw and a craft" borders on being too diagnostic for an otherwise seamlessly embodied characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation as a “natural history illustrator, more patient than brave” is established with precision and directly fuels the plot. Interiority is poetic and consistent, particularly the rejection of metaphor in favor of observation, which creates a rich tension in a highly metaphorical story. The pivotal choice to release the larva rather than merely document it represents a powerful, earned shift from observer to participant, fulfilling the 9+ test of contradictory impulses resolving with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply realized interiority rooted in the central metaphor of emotional mathematics. Motivation is specific and compelling ("not reunion, but coherence"), and the internal conflict between grief and the desire for a logical framework is sustained. The final shift to a state of earned stasis—accepting an unsolvable but portable theorem—is a credible and moving resolution earned by the preceding ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—"to become visible to those who need you"—is masterfully held in tension with his method of invisibility. This internal conflict is not just stated but embodied in every action, culminating in an Earned Stasis that feels profound and inevitable. The character's "kindly methodical" nature is demonstrated through concrete actions like mapping routes and caching comforts, making his final choice to retreat an act of strength, not failure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central internal conflict between the habit of control and the nascent desire to listen is dramatized with concrete, memorable details. Personifying the "old impulse to fix everything" as a seated, persuasive figure is a masterful way to stage an internal debate. The final earned change is quiet but profound, rooted in every observation that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a narrator whose interiority is beautifully rendered through their painter's eye. The motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" is established early and drives every action. The keeper serves as an effective mirror, and his grief is embodied and palpable when he sees the brooch. The shared trait "wryly earnest," while establishing an immediate bond, is a minor echo that slightly flattens their distinction, but the keeper's actions—apologizing to barnacles—give it concrete life beyond the label.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    The clairvoyant's characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent irony of a seer who "did not see it coming." The internal conflict between professional duty and the unfolding reality is rendered with subtlety and power, culminating in an earned renunciation of certainty. The pilgrim, defined by his humble baker past, serves as a perfect foil, and his backstory is skillfully integrated to trigger the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's conceptual framework. The archivist's interiority is expressed through a professional lens that never feels artificial ("my ledgers are maps of currents and memories"). The woman, while less developed, serves as a perfect catalyst, her motivation rooted in a specific, poignant experience of a failed return. The final exchange, where the archivist gives the valve back, demonstrates an earned change in understanding for both characters, moving from individual loss to a shared, active practice of remembering.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict between meticulous control and intuitive artistry is not just stated but embodied in every action. The motivation to find the "fortress of unspoken truths" is unwavering and the final choice to abandon rigid maps for "kinder measures" represents an earned, resonant change. The phrase "a compass with curiosity" is a perfectly distilled character summary that pays off throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator's characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent internal conflict of a "sympathetic skeptic." The motivation "to sculpt space for reflection without surrendering reason" is beautifully dramatized. The final turn, where the narrator speaks their own losses, provides a costly and earned change, fulfilling the 9+ test. A hairline deduction for Lio, who functions perfectly as a catalyst but verges on being a pure archetype of childhood grief without a specific, surprising edge.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator's motivation as a "bored immortal who... refuses endings" is established immediately and drives every action with compelling clarity. The character's internal state is rendered through a highly specific and consistent perceptual signature, avoiding all cliché. The final shift from ennui to purpose is earned through the story’s central event, with the cost of memories making the change feel substantial and real.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator's motivation—seeking an "inverse function" to their father's dishonest "miracles"—is both unique and deeply integrated. This core contradiction is dramatized through specific, high-stakes actions, culminating in a choice that feels both risky and inevitable. The internal state is rendered with precision and embodied in actions like keeping a hand on Arman's shoulder, making the change from seeking fairness to achieving it palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in the specific poetics of his trade. Interiority is concrete and memorable, avoiding cliché; lines like "numbers are a courtesy to uncertainty" establish a unique mind. The character is a perfect vessel for the story's lyrical aims, and his final act of endurance—beginning the letters with a steady hand—constitutes a powerful, earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific: not a generic quest for truth, but a desire for “the texture of memories.” This distinct goal perfectly justifies the quiet, confrontational climax where he offers the label as a catalyst for memory and fear rather than a legal accusation. His internal state is vividly embodied, particularly in the line, "When I touch the paper, my fingertips taste bitter, the way lies do when you first remember telling them," which externalizes memory as a physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's central contradiction, "gloomy cheerfulness," is skillfully embodied rather than just stated. His motivation is clear and his unusual methods feel authentic to the character. The arrival of the second figure provides a necessary turn, but reads more as a personified concept than a fully independent character, which softens the pressure of the crucible moment slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Nessa’s internal conflict, her "dual allegiance," is not merely stated but deeply embodied in her actions and relationships, particularly with her brother. The voice is specific and compelling ("I think in loops and ledgers"), and her final shift from quiet navigator to active shaper of events is earned and powerful. The brief interaction with the liaison reveals her principles under pressure with startling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is impeccably clear, rooted in a beautifully rendered personal history (the Nightwatch mother) and a professional duty. Interiority is exceptional, moving from poignant reflection ("every answer feels like a door to another losing") to focused action. The core internal conflict—the drive to preserve versus the acceptance of loss—is embodied in the act of photography itself, earning the final, quiet renunciation with profound emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is achieved with remarkable efficiency through action and a unique perceptual filter. The artisan's motivation is clear and her competence is tested, revealing her core value of "precision, not panic" in a key moment. While the interiority is slightly distant and the character leans towards a "wise artisan" archetype, the specificity of her craft and worldview makes her feel distinct and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.8)
    The characterization is exceptional, establishing a compelling internal conflict between the narrator's precise profession as an "atlas editor" and the intuitive, almost mystical quest they undertake. The motivation is clear and strong, and the change from seeker to "clerk and herald" is earned through on-page action and reflection. The voice is rooted in a specific, credible contradiction: "I am not brave, but I am subtly confident," which grounds the fantastical elements in a believable psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tuner's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent: "to restore shared balance." This motive is not merely stated but embodied in every action, from his patient pacing to his gentle interaction with the wary mother. The internal conflict between his infinite patience and the felt "urgency [that] played his ribs like strings" adds a layer of complexity to an otherwise archetypal character. The final choice to stay and "keep time" is earned by the entire preceding narrative, representing a commitment born from a successful, shared practice, with the cost being the ongoing, "unglamorous" work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation is primal (survival), but their interiority is complex, blending technical competence with a poetic sensibility. The internal conflict between instinctual panic and trained stillness is dramatized beautifully in two key moments, culminating in choices that feel earned. The brief reflection on the sister and the lilacs provides just enough backstory to ground the character's unique worldview without losing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, rooted in the compelling legacy of the “cry wolf boy who cried wolf’s son.” The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, earning its final resonant shift. However, a slight deduction is made for moments of overly diagnostic self-awareness, such as “I am trying to become the echo that stops screaming,” which verge on summarizing the internal conflict rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's poetic voice. The Keeper's motivation is established as a longing for a "heart key," a clear and compelling internal need. The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous humor" manifests in dialogue that is sharp yet instructive, earning her authority. The final emotional state of "mournful elation" is perfectly earned through the preceding actions, representing a complex and mature resolution with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is established through a powerful, unified voice and a clear, compelling motivation. Sera’s core trait, "hauntingly optimistic, which is the same as stubborn," is not just stated but demonstrated through her choice to defy broken precedents. Her interiority is concrete and poetic ("my hands learned meter from rope and salt"), and her competence is balanced with the significant weight of her task, making the resolution feel earned rather than easy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation to “restore lost faith” is clear and deepens from a passive observer to an active participant. The internal conflict is beautifully rendered through embodied emotion, especially the final, earned change: “I felt a hinge give way in my chest.” This isn't a simple epiphany but a physical release, earned by the preceding actions and textural accumulation of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb, establishing a competent, observant professional whose core motivation is powerfully illuminated by the late-story reflection. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with concrete, unique phrasing ("test names the way dentists test nerves"). The final choice of "Auricle" is not just a solution but an embodiment of the character's entire philosophy, earned through the sensory details of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional, driven by a singular, confident, and poetic voice. The narrator’s motivation and methods—disguising wisdom as foolishness, listening to the pauses—are seamlessly integrated, making their final acceptance of being blamed a powerful and earned moment of self-actualization. The keeper provides perfect, minimalist pressure, his character revealed entirely through gesture and a single line of dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict—the tension between fleeing a difficult moment and the desire for connection—is rendered with deeply specific, embodied emotion. The motivation is clear and compelling, and the final shift from seeking to change the past to seeking to "witness honestly" is an earned, nuanced resolution. The line "I am ashamed of that tenderness hoarded" is a moment of profound, non-diagnostic self-awareness that feels entirely true to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.7)
    The narrator’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and dramatized. Their professional identity is seamlessly fused with a personal philosophy (“to graft new meaning onto old wounds”), which drives every micro-choice, from palming the coral to framing the interpretation of the cast. The interiority is rich and particular, avoiding all cliché; contradictory impulses are shown in the tension between professional duty and deep empathy. The final change in the room is earned entirely by the protagonist's specific, high-stakes actions.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The artist’s motivation to “rediscover lost joy” is established clearly and provides a strong through-line. Interiority is concrete and specific, particularly in the description of “pensive mirth.” The character's professional practice directly informs their actions, and the micro-choice to engage the community after a personal failure is a well-motivated turn. The characterization is strong, though it lacks a deeper internal contradiction or flaw that would elevate the stakes from a challenge to a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core concept. The motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" is not just stated but dramatized through every action, culminating in the earned admission of fear. The protagonist's "methodically playful" manner is perfectly embodied in the synthesis of precise technique and whimsical inquiry, making the final internal shift feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation—to guard the spark of defiance—is established through backstory and consistently drives every choice, culminating in the final, ingenious performance. Interiority is rendered through a distinctive, lyrical voice without resorting to cliché or summary. The relationship with Dr. Kline is economically drawn but powerful, providing the crucible for the final confrontation. The character feels singular and fully realized, with flaws (a "cryptic habit") that are expertly turned into strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, though the direct articulation ("to photosynthesize pain into beauty") borders on the diagnostic. The internal conflict between doubt and the "shyly unstoppable" drive is well-realized, culminating in an earned micro-choice of consent. The Gardener functions effectively as a catalyst for the protagonist's change rather than a fully developed character, which is appropriate for this story's length and lyric focus.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The caretaker's motivation is anchored by a sharp, specific backstory ("I failed them once... I promised never to lose a name again"), creating a powerful internal stake. The conflict between their "gently systematic" professionalism and the faltering heartbeat of personal investment is embodied perfectly during the climax, fulfilling the 9+ test of contradictory impulses acting in-scene with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's central trait, "carefully reckless," is not just stated but dramatized, motivating both the past failure and the present attempt at resolution.

The final earned change—from a solo composition to a collaborative revision—shows a profound and believable shift, with the cost of future vulnerability made explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The machinist’s motivation is crystal clear and their internal state ("my own heart thrummed between them") aligns perfectly with the central conflict. While the character is more of a mythic archetype of competence and empathy than a deeply flawed individual, this choice serves the story's fable-like quality. The characterization is powerful and consistent, though the internal conflict resolves into decisive action without much dramatized struggle, keeping it just shy of a top score.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation—fear of betrayal versus the need for connection—is established with piercing specificity ("Once I gave my music to the wrong mind"). The internal conflict is not summarized but embodied in every action, from calibrating doubt with a meteorite to mapping dust motes. The final choice to trust is earned through a slow accumulation of evidence, culminating in the realization that the violinist's bow "rasps truth and it sings apology," a choice that feels both difficult and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, and the interiority is rendered with a distinct, memorable voice. The final choice to maintain distance is a powerful act of Earned Stasis, fully justified by the preceding internal journey and grounded by the felt cost in the line "I breathed in that ache." Characterization is flawless, avoiding cliché and achieving a profound emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, and the final change in their worldview is well-earned. Rin serves her purpose effectively as a supporting character without pulling focus. However, the protagonist's direct articulation of their motive to the memory engine—"I answered truthfully that I wanted to learn the rhythm of belonging"—veers into diagnostic self-awareness, slightly flattening the moment's emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's voice and motivation are exceptionally clear and consistent. The character reads as a competent, almost mythic professional, which serves the story's folkloric tone. However, the internal conflict remains low; the "cheerful gloom" is a beautifully articulated state but doesn't create contradictory impulses that complicate on-page choices. The journey to the solution is quite smooth, lacking a moment of genuine struggle or misstep born from a character flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's voice is a masterclass in characterization, blending analytical detachment ("calculus of misrule") with poetic sensitivity. Motivation is established early and remains the core engine: "to serenade monotony with creativity." The internal conflict between orchestrating events and allowing them to "happen" is beautifully dramatized, and the final choice to let the moment with the janitor resolve quietly, without applause, provides an earned and resonant closure with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptionally strong, driven by a deeply-rooted and consistent motivation to preserve art against erasure. The narrator’s interiority is poetic and particular, with emotions embodied in the language of their craft (e.g., reading currents, spinning the moon's pull). The transformation from “elective exile” to “vocation” is earned on the page, representing a meaningful change sealed by the story’s central act. The cartographer, while less developed, serves as a perfect catalyst, their specific desire (“Your departures, my returns”) giving the abstract act a concrete, relational purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between artistic integrity and commercial pressures is vividly rendered. The final choice to champion a more humane design is earned through the on-page crucible of reflection and interaction with the boy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is potent and deeply embodied, especially the protagonist's internal conflict and the nuanced dynamic with the mother. The line "He did not forgive himself; he made room around the fact the way rock makes room for water" is world-class. The score is capped from the 9+ band by a few instances of overly articulate, diagnostic interiority, such as "He had come to translate pain into a universal language," which feels more like an authorial thesis than a character's raw thought.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's characterization as a "logical dreamer" is exceptionally well-realized and consistent. Motivation is crystalline and rooted in a communal need, driving a specific, methodical process rather than vague yearning. The internal state is conveyed through precise, embodied actions—arranging patterns, reading the gauge, breathing into the bladder—perfectly balancing the story's conceptual ambition with grounded activity, fully earning the final shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established as a powerful, character-defining vow, and their interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity and poetic precision. The internal conflict—whether to map faithfully or "shirk the weight with pretty symbols"—is masterfully dramatized, culminating in an earned change. The final acceptance of legacy's burden is not a simple choice but a transformation that costs the character their name, a visceral and beautifully executed embodiment of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's poetic logic. The protagonist's motivation is established with lyrical precision, and her internal conflict—the tension between her own desperation and the "borrowed heartbeat, careful as a stranger"—is beautifully embodied. The mirage painter serves as a perfect catalyst, her calm providing a necessary crucible for the protagonist's transformation. The final change is earned through the on-page lesson, resulting in a credible shift from defeated hope to disciplined practice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's characterization as a practiced, almost priestly figure is exceptionally consistent. Motivation is clear and compelling, expressed through the core value of being "operatively gentle." The internal state is revealed through precise, embodied details ("hands...trained to hold tension without bruising") and a coherent worldview, rather than through abstract emotional labels. Contradictory impulses are presented externally through the delegates, allowing the narrator to act as a crucible, earning their final authority.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, presenting a core internal conflict between the "amoral philanthropist" and the "secretly sentimental" man without resorting to summary. The contradiction is dramatized through his actions: financing a drought for profit and prestige, while privately building an altar to a manufactured memory. The final moment of his eyes watering is an earned, embodied leak of the sentiment he otherwise commodifies, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character is realized through a highly specific, embodied interiority. Motivation ("to defy the lullaby of conformity") is consistently dramatized through her precise, controlled actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply felt and specific internal conflict. The narrator's shift from an artist with "ethics I had not yet earned" to one who has "learned how to follow" is earned and profound. The internal voice, particularly the reflection on the "urbane in me a polish borrowed from other voices," provides a clear, flawed, and compelling motivation for change. The final serenity feels completely earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation as an "esoteric realist" is exceptionally clear and consistently executed through their specific, ritualistic actions. Interiority is rich and particular, avoiding cliché. The final change—a commitment to a "soft" record of "moss and echo"—is a subtle but meaningful shift, earned by the communion with the monarch and the grotto, representing a renunciation of permanence with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The motivation for self-forgiveness is established immediately and earned through the specific, costly memory of the mislabeled bell. Interiority is rendered with concrete, profession-specific metaphors ("I carry heat like a conscience"), and the central contradiction of being "technically gentle" versus having made a clumsy, harmful mistake creates a compelling internal conflict. The final change, from seeking forgiveness to accepting a new purpose ("stay, cast, listen"), is a mature and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is established immediately and serves as the story's central question. The interiority is superb, characterized by a unique voice that blends the technical and the mythic ("soldering meaning to broken instructions"). The internal conflict between adherence to a dead past and the hunger for a living future is beautifully embodied in the act of breaking the wafer seal. The final change feels entirely earned, a crystallization of the character's internal journey rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the specific trait of "frugality" which is reframed as a form of piety. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding cliché; lines like "empirically ironic and unashamed" give the character a sharp, self-aware intellectual and emotional texture. The final change—a vow—is a perfect example of Earned Stasis, a renunciation of grandeur for stewardship, with the cost explicitly paid in "oil when oil was spare, and hours when hours were kinder than coin."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is the story's great strength. The narrator's voice is distinct and compelling, and Rell's transformation from a burdened "question mark" to a man unburdened is earned and affecting. His internal state is rendered with superb physical specificity ("spine learned to quarrel with waking"). A minor reservation is the narrator's flawless, almost omniscient benevolence; their complete control and lack of any visible vulnerability or cost to themselves slightly flattens their own character into a perfect facilitator.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is subtle and strong. Ilen's identity as a craftsman, not a mystic, grounds the fantastical events in concrete action and thought ("his mind a carpenter's plan"). The internal shift from the goal of "capture" to the understanding of "care" is earned through the climax, particularly his choice to steady Noor by recalling physical, seasonal labor rather than through abstract will.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, complex, and embodied in his actions, particularly his handling of the tin and ribbon. The internal conflict between professional duty, personal grief, and emergent hope is well-dramatized through his interactions with the orchard and Mira. The final choice to leave the tin unopened represents a powerfully earned change in stance, a form of active waiting that feels true to the character arc. A minor deduction is for moments of overly polished self-reflection, like "wisdom is what you trip over and pretend you meant to kick," which feel slightly outside the immediate, raw voice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The curator's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in his relationship with his vanished aunt. His internal state of "brightened disquiet" is well-embodied through his actions. The final shift to "bewildered and resolute" marks an earned change, though the explicit "He understood then..." phrasing verges on summarizing an epiphany rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot through their professional ethos as a "rescuer." However, the character's interiority remains somewhat abstract, serving the story's conceptual framework more than revealing a deep, contradictory personal struggle. The choice to rescue the apprentice feels more like a necessary transactional step than a crucible that forges a profound internal change; the emotional cost is stated rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core internal conflict between "discoverer" and "person" is beautifully externalized through the "chimera twin" concept and the "not-mine voice." The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, and the final choice to renounce the discoverer self for a future of becoming is an earned, costly act that provides powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    The archivist's motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. His interiority is specific and sophisticated, particularly the tension between his job and the temptation to "worship confusion," which justifies his choice to restore order rather than explore the magic further. The character is a masterfully realized archetype, though a single moment of genuine doubt or a minor misstep before the final success would have added a final layer of depth.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is crystalline and their professional competence is balanced with a genuine need to learn and adapt. Interiority is rendered with beautiful specificity, particularly the contrast between internal uncertainty and external action in "welcomed them with a nod that pretended confidence." The final earned stasis—accepting the ongoing duty of tending the quiet—provides a satisfying and costly character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    The custodian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and their interiority is rendered in a distinct, poetic voice. The characterization is strong, but slightly weakened when the narrator's internal thoughts shift into direct thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("This was not coincidence as shrug; this was coincidence as stitch"). This moment feels less like an embodied realization and more like an authorial thesis statement, momentarily flattening the otherwise nuanced voice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The archivist's motivation—to find a personal identity within a collective role—is clear, poignant, and drives the narrative. The internal conflict is dramatized with superb specificity, particularly in the contrast between their duty and the feeling that "every draft sounded like an echo." The final choice to share a personal memory is a powerful, earned resolution, demonstrating a meaningful change with the felt cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored in the philosophy of "serious playfulness." Interiority is poetic and specific, avoiding cliché. However, the characterization lacks a moment of dramatized internal conflict; the narrator proceeds with unwavering competence, which slightly lessens the sense of personal risk and makes the final triumph feel more assured than hard-won against an internal foe.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's interiority is exceptionally well-realized and specific to their identity as a "tidal-pool chronicler." The central conflict between love and vocation is embodied in concrete actions, like weighing the cicada, rather than abstractly summarized. The final choice feels earned, arising directly from the narrator's unique way of processing the world ("through tangential approach"), making the characterization and motivation deeply intertwined and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and rooted in the core contradiction of being a claustrophobic bunker-builder's child. The internal conflict is dramatized through action—seeking vastness to solve a problem of confinement. The father’s shift at the end feels earned within the story’s magical realist logic, with his final line, "safe like stepping into a room you have never left," providing a powerful and character-particular resolution that satisfies the protagonist's quest.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation, rooted in the specific backstory of the singer, is both poetic and grounded. The mathematician's internal conflict is powerfully shown through the contrast between her "fluidly logical" speech and her turbulent hands, and her final, earned relaxation is a credible and moving character shift. The contradictory impulses—the need for logical proof versus the desire to be held—act simultaneously and resolve into a new state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored in the "lore keeper" identity. The final choice to "remember more than to rule" is a perfectly earned culmination of this trait, avoiding a generic power grab. Quin is a functional but less developed foil. The internal conflict is articulated concisely ("crown hunger" vs. "old ache of libraries"), directly motivating the climactic decision with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, defined by a distinct and consistently applied philosophy ("leaving can be an act of stewardship"). Motivation is both articulated and dramatized, with the internal conflict between willed solitude and compassionate duty playing out in scene. The final action—stepping aside for the student—is a perfect, earned culmination of the "tender shadow keeper" role, demonstrating a change in the student while reinforcing the narrator's earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The motivation to "translate pressure into diamonds" is a powerful engine, directly rooted in the "pyramid scheme survivor" backstory. The internal conflict between doubt and trusting the strange guidance from other selves is dramatized with embodied stakes, culminating in the choice to sign the console—an act that aligns motive, action, and theme with a clear, felt cost. The protagonist's transformation is earned and resonant, particularly in the shift from a "ruined ledger" to a "ledger of breath."

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, evolving from a perceived duty to manage shame to the acceptance of a profound, merciful legacy. The interior shift from "the weight of shame" to the feeling of something that "unclenched" is an exceptionally well-earned and embodied emotional arc. The final choice to leave the seal is a perfect renunciation, resonant with the ancestors' decision to "fold its banners."

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The knight's motivation is established with poignant specificity, rooted in the memory of his mother and the weariness of his violent past. The internal conflict between the trained warrior and the son seeking a different legacy is palpable, culminating in the "murmured allegiance" which feels earned. The choice to follow the program's cues is balanced by the personal nature of his final vow, making his transformation from a figure of "charge and clash" to one of "tending" credible and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.7)
    The protagonist's interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity. The central conflict between being "broken-hearted" and "tactfully hopeful" is not merely stated but dramatized through the choice to amend a closed file.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mara's motivation is established with a sharp, personal stake—the erasure of her mother's voice. Her core trait of being "carefully resourceful" is demonstrated through action rather than stated. The final emotional beat, where she smiles "not for triumph" but from a sense of purpose, represents a powerful and earned internal shift, crystallizing her transformation from a quiet clerk into a self-aware, enduring resistor.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained by a potent blend of duty and grief. Interiority is rendered through specific, embodied actions and perceptions—the sax as an "amulet against remembering," the "learned tremor" in the hands—rather than abstract summary. The internal conflict between the oath and the painful memory of the teacher creates a constant, elegiac pressure that culminates in an act of earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is stellar, with a consistent and specific interiority. The moment of hesitation ("I do not prod the leaf; I prod myself") is an excellent, concise dramatization of internal conflict, which makes the final change in perspective feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's transformation from a seeker of precision to an apprentice of uncertainty is earned and compelling. The internal conflict is clear and the final change is supported by the preceding journey. The line "I had chased exactness, not fidelity to the living irregular beat" marks a powerful, earned epiphany. A minor deduction is for moments where the interiority verges on articulating the theme too directly, slightly stepping out of a purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation—a blend of professional rigor and personal guilt—is exceptionally clear and compelling. Interiority is rendered through precise, embodied action rather than summary, with internal conflict shown in the meticulous ritual to reconcile "proof and wonder." The final earned stasis ("I am not healed, but I am held together") is a powerful and credible resolution, earned through the preceding struggle and foreclosing the path of unresolved grief.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's characterization is superb, established immediately with the resonant "gardener of untended laughter." Motivation is crystalline and drives every action without feeling programmatic. The internal state, "modestly fearless," is beautifully dramatized in the gentle, non-judgmental method used to coax the spirit. The narrator's final realization about the crocodile tooth provides a subtle but profound internal shift, demonstrating a capacity for change that elevates them beyond a mere functionary.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply embodied interiority rooted in the specific trauma and the unique "proprioceptively enhanced" trait. The motivation to find "the mathematics of mercy" is clear and compelling, and the final shift from "instrument" to "wood again" represents a profound, earned change with a clear cost—the burden of a new rule. The internal conflict is not just stated but felt through the physical sensations that trigger memory.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and integrated into the story's economy ("this is how I eat: with recovered names").

The final choice to return the name is earned through a sustained, focused effort that aligns perfectly with the character's established abilities and values, paying off with a felt, non-material cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the unique worldview of his profession. Interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the tension between "duty and curiosity," which is resolved through a choice that feels earned. The character's competence is balanced by the genuine mystery, and his final action aligns perfectly with his established desire to "keep the living honest," showing a meaningful change with a felt cost (carrying the "receipt").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is a perfectly balanced contradiction between a professional duty to maintain imperfection and a deeply personal hunger for a perfect moment, rooted in the mother's story. The final choice to print the clause is not a simple victory but an earned renunciation, powerfully resolving both the internal and external conflicts with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator's characterization is exceptional, with a motivation deeply rooted in their past as a "defunct revolutionary" that gives their present scholarly pursuit a profound, melancholic weight. The internal conflict between failed political action and the potential for cultural revision is palpable and earned. While Professor Ledger functions more as a necessary ideological foil, his final moment of perplexed, aging laughter provides a brief, effective glimpse of humanity. The narrator's final emotional state is a complex and credible mixture of victory and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and core traits driving every key action. The protagonist's defining trait—"I wilt near dishonesty"—is not merely stated but dramatized twice with consequences: first with the watchman, where it creates a moment of weakness followed by strength, and second in the confession, where truth becomes an act of power. This consistency makes the final sacrifice feel earned and inevitable, fulfilling the 9+ test for character.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to "find the place where explanations fail" is established as a compellingly eccentric intellectual pursuit that is later revealed as a defense against unresolved grief. The emotional progression is masterful, particularly the embodied realization of grief as a physical mechanism: "Something inside me opens on corroded pins... that clicks but does not close again." This change is earned through the escalating psychometric visions, transforming the character from an observer of mystery to a participant in his own history.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a unique worldview ("reads knots the way others read lines on palms"). The interiority is specific and evocative, avoiding cliché. The character's change—a deepened understanding that leads to a vow—is earned through the story's central symbolic act, but the internal journey lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory conflict, reading more as a seamless unfolding of purpose than a struggle against a genuine internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, providing a strong narrative engine. The interiority is specific and rich, particularly in the line, "Night, I thought, is not the opposite of day but a careful engraving that lets certain truths appear." The character is a bit too harmonious, lacking the internal friction or contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization to the highest tier; she serves as a near-perfect vessel for the story's lyrical inquiry rather than a complexly flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and complex, driven by a desire for "truth in tension, not relief." Interiority is rendered through potent, specific imagery rather than labels, and the final change—being "half-retrocognitively trapped, but the other half walks forward"—is a nuanced and earned resolution showing the profound personal cost of their victory.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.4)
    Iria's characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and consistent motivation rooted in her core trait of rejecting "false comfort." Her interiority is specific and philosophical ("absence made the world feel poorly punctuated"), avoiding cliché. The arrival of the sailor provides a brief but effective crucible, confirming her values and allowing her to transition from solitary conception to shared labor. The final choice to lead this new form of revival is earned by every preceding action and thought.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The internal conflict between the scribe's professional duty to archive and his empathetic need to prevent harm is made concrete and compelling by the backstory of the "pin in his breath." The final choice to "trust unrecording" is a powerful, earned renunciation of his core function, demonstrating a clear and costly hierarchy of values. A minor deduction for the slightly too-declarative line, "To archive emotional patterns, I must refuse to become their victim," which verges on summarizing the internal state rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is singular and deeply felt, rooted in a powerful sense of lineage and purpose. Interiority is exceptional, rendered in concrete, contradictory phrases like "furiously tranquil, steady in their storm," which avoids cliché and embodies the character's state perfectly. The final change—accepting the mantle of keeper—is earned through a ritualistic act of understanding rather than a simple decision, with the cost being a profound transformation of self into a vessel for seasons.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and dramatized through the internal conflict between professional duty and personal philosophy. Interiority is rendered with a singular, poetic voice, avoiding cliché; lines like "the intangible hinge where fear becomes guidance" are superb. The change in Reni from a foil urging a by-the-book action to a collaborator who "lowered her hands" is earned through the protagonist's patient guidance, making the final shared listening a powerful crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Motivation and interiority are beautifully rendered, tracing a clear arc from hiding to a transparent strength. The character's contradictory impulses—to retreat from the world versus the active, empathetic attention he gives the station—drive the narrative. A single line of over-explicit thematic realization ("I realized the purpose...") slightly undermines the otherwise earned epiphany, keeping it from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The recluse's internal conflict between passive witnessing and active complicity is dramatized with precision, culminating in an earned choice. The shift from a "tranquilly perceptive" observer to a custodian accepting a "tolerable" pain is a masterful arc for this length. His astonishment—"his only arrogance"—provides a unique and resonant emotional core that elevates him beyond a stock survivor archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrator's motivation is consistently embodied and drives the entire plot. The change from a "clicking" heart to a "listening" one is an exceptionally well-earned emotional closure, rooted in the backstory with the mother which is revealed with perfect timing. Lio is a functional catalyst rather than a deeply drawn character, but this is a strength in a story of this length and focus. The narrator's internal state is rendered with specific, contradictory, and beautiful detail.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from observation to intervention. His character is revealed through his specific, gentle choices, particularly the reframing of the boy's loss. However, he reads as a fully-formed archetype of the wise artist, lacking an internal contradiction or flaw that is tested in the scene; his wisdom is presented as a given, not earned through on-page struggle, which slightly lessens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "choose work over sorrow" is established immediately and executed with unwavering consistency. The interiority, expressed through the voice's "brazen calm," feels earned rather than declared. The character's change is not a dramatic reversal but a deepening of purpose, culminating in an earned stasis where death is a return, not a departure, which is powerfully aligned with the story's core actions and themes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is superb. The narrator's central contradiction as a "luminous skeptic" is dramatized, not just stated, through small actions like the raised eyebrow and the internal monologue that translates ritual into chemistry. The final shift in perspective feels earned, a maturation of rebellion into a new discipline rather than a simple conversion. The voice is distinct and powerfully sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.6)
    The coachman is a masterfully drawn character, defined by his patient, ritualistic actions rather than extensive interiority. His motivation—atonement through cultivation—is both clear and profound, driving every beat of the narrative. The story achieves a rare portrait of competence and grief, where contradictory impulses (remembering war, creating life) are held in a sustained, active tension that culminates in his nightly work, making the final state of endurance feel completely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a tangible object and a deeply felt promise. The interiority is exceptional, expressed through a unique perceptual style ("catalog a cloud by smell") rather than generic emotional labels. The bloodhound, Harbor, is a well-realized secondary character whose actions—particularly finding the second cylinder—provide a crucial narrative turn, grounding the narrator's more intuitive leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation and internal conflict—the blessed pariah seeking a fixed point—are established with poetic precision and drive the entire narrative. The shift from seeking an external "true north" to creating an internal one is an earned, meaningful change with a clear cost. The interiority is exceptionally specific, avoiding all cliche and embodying emotion through concrete, unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's core identity as a "chivalrous thief" and "apprentice of wonder" is not just a label but the engine for every action. The internal conflict is embodied beautifully in "cautious abandon" and trembling hands, showing contradictory impulses in-scene and earning the final "trembling certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in their backstory as a “crisis actor real crisis survivor.” The internal conflict between a performed role and an authentic new purpose is resolved with a powerful, earned renunciation at the end. The character’s “benevolently ruthless” nature is demonstrated through concrete action, and their final choice to “travel with the nomadic penumbra” is a perfect culmination of their arc, paid for with the cost of being erased from the official record.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established with poetic precision and maintained throughout. The internal conflict between the pain of memory and the need for wholeness is embodied in concrete actions, particularly the choice to touch the stone. The final change, articulated in the choice to "seed my tongue," is earned by the preceding sensory and emotional journey, foreclosing the path of silence with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to find forgiveness is established early and provides a powerful, consistent drive. His identity as a chess tutor is not a label but the core of his perception and action, brilliantly demonstrated in lines like "reading them like moves in a line" and his choice of the "longer method, as a tutor does." The internal conflict between the ruthless strategist he created and the restorative tutor he wants to be is masterfully dramatized in the choice between a "brilliant sacrifice" and a slower, kinder resolution, giving the final act of forgiveness a deeply earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    The artist's motivation is exceptionally clear, driven by a compelling blend of guilt, grief for his mentor, and philosophical defiance. His internal conflict is embodied in concrete details like "eyes rubbed raw by choices" and the debt that "pulsed inside every color." The final choice to pay for the child is a perfect culmination of his character arc, demonstrating a shift from intellectual defiance to personal sacrifice, which is then elegantly reconfigured by the child's action. The contradictory impulses—fear of his mentor's fate versus the drive to change the system—act simultaneously and power the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation rooted in grief and a promise. The alchemist's interiority is rendered through specific, embodied details ("lead in my chest") and his contradictory impulses—doubt versus hope—are active throughout the scene. The final shift from a haunting uncertainty to bearing a "sharpened hope" is a subtle but profoundly earned change, achieved with a visible cost (relinquishing the fantasy of Mira's return for a more complex truth).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a distinct interiority from the first line. The central contradiction—being "intimately aloof" yet tied to the "salt ghosts of places"—is not just stated but dramatized throughout the journey. The final change is earned through the crucible of the cave, and the choice to make one small mark and leave demonstrates a profound, credible shift from the painter who previously created "careful replicas."

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and deeply embodied. Interiority is rendered with a unique and specific texture, avoiding all stock phrasing. The final earned change is the mentor’s acceptance, which lands with quiet power, validating the protagonist’s entire worldview and foreclosing the path of doubt. The character’s competence is balanced by the vulnerability of their strange belief, making the final vindication resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation to "navigate the geography of loss" is established immediately and embodied through their work. Interiority is rendered with concrete, non-clichéd language ("the questions rust in my mouth"), and the climactic choice is an earned endurance ("not return but recognition"), which forecloses the path of simple recovery with a palpable cost. The link between the narrator's grief and their task is seamless and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, defined by a compelling internal contradiction: a "rational truffle forager" who relies on "rumored cures in discredited textbooks." This tension fuels the narrative. Motivation is crystal clear and embodied, particularly in the micro-choices made under pressure, like smearing the copper rim with mud—an act of careful, rational protection for a deeply irrational hope. The final earned stasis ("fractured grace is the only style we have left") is a powerful and credible resolution for this specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lighthouse keeper's character is rendered with exceptional consistency and depth. His motivation to decode the gesture is clear, and his method of "observing gaps" is not just a label but a demonstrated practice that drives the plot. The internal conflict between his isolated nature and the empathetic act of communication is subtly and effectively dramatized, culminating in an action that feels both inevitable and costly, as he accepts the "weight" of being a witness.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a protagonist defined by stillness and observation whose transformation into an actor is both credible and moving. The internal conflict is rendered with poetic specificity, and the final choice to retrieve the chip—"because leaving it would make the door too easy"—is a masterclass in revealing character through a small, decisive action. The motivation, rooted in the lingering promise to Ruth, is clear, potent, and beautifully sustained throughout the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    The queen's motivation is established immediately and remains the clear driver of the narrative. Her interiority is rendered through specific, character-particular perceptions, such as seeing the omen of "bleeding starlight" as a "road." Her earned change is demonstrated in her quiet assertion to the wanderer ("I am precisely when I can be") and culminates in the final, resonant choice to integrate her dreams rather than dismiss them, accepting the cost of becoming a different kind of ruler.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's unique voice. The narrator's "scientifically romantic" nature is not just a label but a demonstrated worldview that motivates every choice, from inventorying variables to whispering rhyming equations. The internal conflict between the impossibility of the task and the loving drive to attempt it is palpable. The final change, a reconfigured friendship, feels earned and profound because it's the direct result of their shared, focused action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific: "to distill chaos into narrative." This existential need drives every action, from examining the scroll to bargaining within the dream. The internal conflict is beautifully rendered through contradictory impulses—the allure of "feral nostalgia" versus the clarifying power of jealousy. The final choice to trade envy for continuity is a sophisticated character turn, earned through the dream's crucible, showing a change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's motivation ("unveil ordinary miracles") and their unique perceptual mode, born from sensory loss, are established with poetic precision and drive every action. The internal state of "trembling calm" is beautifully embodied. The visiting father is rendered with equal specificity through his fear and his small, courageous offering of the screw, a gesture that reveals a history of care. Their interaction is a masterclass in showing character through shared, delicate action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a rich, specific interiority that avoids all cliché. Motivation is clear and deeply felt, driving the ritual with palpable need. The device of pouring tea for "the person I was" is a masterful, concrete way to dramatize internal change and self-compassion, grounding the abstract goal in a physical act. The voice is flawlessly integrated with the character's identity as an earnest, budding scholar.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in a past failure, and their interiority is rendered with specific, powerful language like "every metaphor felt like a cracked teacup unfit for hot regret." The change from passive regret to active atonement is earned and dramatized through a choice with a clear professional cost, satisfying the core demands of a compelling arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a highly specific and sustained interiority. The narrator's shift from an active "witness" seeking to "unify" to a receptive "hinge" who must "listen" is a profound and earned change. This transformation, catalyzed by the temple's ritual, represents a credible renunciation of a previous self-concept, with the cost being the loss of a grand title for a quieter, more fundamental purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is established early and provides a powerful engine for what is an otherwise quiet, internal story. The internal conflict between procedural duty and philosophical inquiry is dramatized through concrete actions, like the "heresy" of using the grandmother's key. The final shift in understanding feels earned, a direct result of the night's specific pressures and not an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, wedding her professional expertise to her personal grief in a way that feels inseparable. Her internal conflict between control (“clench”) and acceptance is dramatized through concrete actions, such as her gentle handling of the cat anomaly. The backstory of Kian is integrated seamlessly, providing emotional weight that directly informs her present choices without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, rooted in the core internal conflict of her identity as a "compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter." This contradiction is not just stated but embodied in her precise, melancholic voice and her choices. The final earned change, where "the warnings and the ambitions finally shared a branch," is a masterful resolution of this conflict, showing a complex character shift with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between empathy and "cultivated estrangement" is compelling. The character is beautifully drawn through her sensory focus on sound. However, the articulation of her core philosophy sometimes slips into diagnostic label-speak ("She was building cultivated estrangement, the craft of standing back..."), which feels overly self-aware and slightly detracts from the embodied nature of her struggle during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. Their voice-driven interiority is potent, though the character can feel more like a beautiful, well-defined archetype than a person with contradictory impulses acting in-scene. The "haunted euphoria" is a compelling label but is described more than it is dramatized through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization of the logistician is exceptional, a masterclass in showing over telling. Contradictory impulses—"desperately jocular and softly tired"—are not just stated but embodied in their actions and smile. Their motivation is clear and their final act of disappearing after empowering the community is a perfect, earned culmination of their elusive, selfless nature, foreclosing their own role with the quiet cost of anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation—to map grief rather than erase it—is clear and compelling, providing a sophisticated internal conflict. The interiority is rendered through a unique and consistent sensory vocabulary ("bark syllables," "moth wing idioms"), making the emotional state profoundly embodied. The final earned stasis, accepting the grief-map as "marrow," is a powerful and earned resolution that fulfills the contradictory impulse of seeking a stillpoint without demanding escape.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's voice is established immediately as "confidently uncertain," a trait that is not just stated but demonstrated through their actions and internal monologue. The motivation, rooted in the concrete failure of "planting the wrong seeds," provides a powerful and specific emotional core that makes the climactic act of "editing" feel earned and necessary. Del serves as a perfect catalyst, providing the philosophical framework that allows the protagonist's internal conflict to find an external, albeit metaphysical, expression.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arin's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, but the characterization functions more as a vessel for the story's concept than a portrait of complex, contradictory humanity. The internal state, particularly "joyful sorrow," is articulated poetically rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices under pressure. While consistent and compelling, the character lacks the deeper internal friction needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is strong and consistent, driven by the central contradiction of the arsonist-preservationist. The narrator’s motivation to fulfill Miren's promise is clear and compelling. The internal state, defined by "volcanic tenderness," is beautifully sustained and embodied in the final act. While mostly excellent, the explicit labeling of the core trait as "analytically intuitive" is a minor slip toward diagnosis rather than pure demonstration, though the story immediately validates it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb, driven by a rich, specific interiority and a core motivation that is both clear and deeply felt. The narrator's "quietly rebellious" nature is demonstrated through consistent action rather than assertion. The climactic choice to accept the spliced donor memories is a powerful, costly decision that compellingly reveals the character's hierarchy of values, making the final change fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ivo’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a specific, demonstrated talent rather than labels. The motivation to prove his quiet method is clear and drives the central conflict. Rade is a functional, if slightly archetypal, foil. The internal state is shown through concrete action, such as tracing the zodiac coin to remember cycles, which lands with more force than a simple statement of belief.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional, driven by embodied emotion and potent micro-choices. The narrator’s journey from passive, grief-stricken observer to active participant is earned, culminating in a credible and powerful internal shift. The guardian, though an archetype, is rendered with immense specificity through his actions, successfully catalyzing the narrator's change without needing dialogue. The single line "His eyes held every failed promise" slightly grazes cliché, a minor imperfection in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. Interiority is lyrical and specific ("my chest felt like open ground"). The primary weakness is that the internal conflict, while present as anxiety ("no one could see the trembling"), is more of a sustained state of hopeful tension than a dynamic clash of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a compelling internal conflict between the "hardshell" persona and the hidden "grace." The motivation to claim a true name is earned through the narrative's mythic logic. The final choice feels inevitable, but a few lines of interiority near the end ("I wanted freedom in embracing my true nature...") lean slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness, momentarily thinning the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core conceit. The internal conflict between the mandated performance and the private cultivation of "lightness" is rendered with precision and embodied in concrete actions like whittling. The contradiction between the external "blank face" and the rich, poetic interiority is the story's engine. The final renunciation of striving for victory in favor of an earned stasis is both credible and moving, a choice earned by every preceding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is potent, especially for the collective "we," whose journey from fearful witness to active participant is earned and palpable. The poet functions effectively as a mythic catalyst, and the guard's small, sharp arc provides a concrete human anchor for the larger change. While the poet remains archetypal, this choice serves the story's fable-like quality, and the emotional states are deeply embodied rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is specific, deeply integrated with the story's unique sensory world, and psychologically coherent. Ivo's motivation is clear and his final earned stasis feels inevitable due to his established traits. The only minor weakness is the trait "innocently cunning," which is asserted rather than fully dramatized through a choice with a visible trade-off; his honest barter reads more as earnestness than cunning.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" is clear and consistent, embodied in every action. Interiority is particular and poetic, avoiding cliché. The character's defining trait, "powerfully gentle," is demonstrated rather than merely stated, earning the final emotional resolution. A slight deduction is for the protagonist's extremely high level of self-articulation, which borders on diagnostic, though it largely succeeds within the story's lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's shift from a paralyzed artist to a "tutor of endings" is earned through a series of specific, ritualistic actions. Her internal conflict is shown, not told, through the charged objects she handles—the tools, the beads, the vellum. The final stasis is a powerful renunciation of her old life and an acceptance of a new, costly purpose, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartomancer is an exceptional character, realized through a cohesive philosophy and concrete, memorable actions. Her motivation is clear and her methods are consistent, creating a powerful sense of presence. The apprentice-narrator serves as an effective lens, and their stated curiosity is a sufficient driver for the observational stance, though their own internal contradictions remain muted, which is an acceptable choice for this story's focus but holds it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to pursue knowledge with "the hunger of drought" is established immediately and tested with escalating specificity. The interiority is exceptional, turning abstract concepts into embodied choices, as when "refusal felt like a smaller betrayal than acceptance." The shift from archivist to teacher is an earned, decisive change, culminating in a credible renunciation of publication for alignment, a cost felt in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation to “preserve the shape of hope” is established early and provides a strong, consistent driver for her actions. Her internal conflict is subtly shown through her leaning "toward the sorrow" despite the threat to the library's balance. The final sacrifice is a powerful, character-defining choice, made credible by her established nature as a patient "dusk noticer," and the cost is felt, satisfying the demands for a change earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's internal conflict—balancing gentle compassion with the necessary ruthlessness to excise a rot, both physical and financial—is dramatized with precision. The transition from shaking hands to a measured cut is earned, embodying the shift from victim to steward. The final articulation of motivation is slightly explicit, but it follows, rather than precedes, the earned action, making it a summary of a demonstrated change.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a potent internal conflict between the need for truth and the pain it causes. The protagonist's motivation is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion, particularly in the desire for numbness versus the return of "pins of sensation." The final earned shift from "blade disguised as a salve" to a caretaker of a "garden" is powerful and lands with credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The crystal gazer’s motivation is established with a compelling, unusual goal, and her interiority is rendered with unique, concrete metaphors ("feelings, which she pictured as rooms"). The climactic realization that she has shelved her own life is an earned, potent internal reversal, directly leading to a final choice that demonstrates change with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's motivation is primal and visceral ("their silence was digging a grave inside me"), providing a powerful engine for the lyrical plot. The internal conflict between being a "moonstruck dreamer" and embracing a difficult "vocation" is beautifully rendered and resolved. The character's transformation is earned through the central ritual, culminating in a credible shift from solitary sufferer to active, hopeful facilitator.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established with unusual clarity ("I am here to cultivate the sparks") and is dramatized through a series of specific, quiet actions. The interiority is concrete and consistent, beautifully captured in the "neither sleeping nor entirely awake" state, which aligns perfectly with the story's quantum-like mechanics. The final transformation, where the guard becomes "occasionally everywhere," shows an earned change that is both subtle and profound, directly tied to the cost of their lonely, patient vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exceptionally well-drawn and consistent. The central conflict between a philosophical appreciation for ruin and the pragmatic need for repair ("I did not want to repair it, because ruin teaches... But the ache... told me repair would be the risk") provides a compelling, character-specific contradiction that drives the climax. This choice is earned and demonstrates a complex hierarchy of values under pressure, making the final change feel significant.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary for an allegorical piece. The protagonist's internal conflict between a named ache and a fear of movement is made tangible through their hesitation and eventual, earned choice. The motivation to find "unused courage" is specific and drives the entire narrative arc. The guides function perfectly as archetypal catalysts, providing philosophy without stealing agency, culminating in a final act of acceptance that feels both earned and transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's interiority is rich and specific, with embodied emotions like "nerves complained like old tenants." Motivation is clear and culminates in an earned act of endurance. However, the score is capped by moments of diagnostic over-articulation, where the character explains the story's theme in essayistic terms (e.g., "It was an unpardonable silence because..."), slightly flattening the voice into a mouthpiece for the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyr's characterization as a patient, powerful sovereign of dust is exceptionally consistent, with his unpretentious nature directly informing his methods. Serane's arc from polished confidence to a forfeiture of her claim is earned, particularly the detail of her "signature that wavered." The final choice lands with a clear and visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test criteria; however, the narrative's lyrical distance keeps the interiority slightly remote, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative. The interiority is exceptional, blending a scientific mindset with a personal history of loss ("a coral bleaching witness recruited from a ruined reef"). The character's core habit—tapping rhythms—is not a mere quirk but the central tool of inquiry and connection, making the final discovery feel deeply earned. The change is profound: an intellectual understanding that becomes an embodied one, as shown in the final dream of the corridor as a spine.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation to find meaning is clear and embodied in her actions, like pressing her ear to the deckplates. Her defining trait, "awkwardly confident," is demonstrated rather than just stated. The character arc from personal grief (finding her father) to communal purpose (guiding the rebellion) feels earned, though the final thematic summary is a slight over-articulation for the character herself.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lida’s characterization is exceptional, with a motivation to "evolve tradition with intent" that is both clearly stated and dramatized through her choices. Her internal conflict is nuanced; she doesn't reject the past but seeks to guide its future, a contradiction that fuels the plot. The final choice to act against the council is a fully earned culmination of her history as an insurgent and her philosophy as a gardener, with the political cost made legible in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rafi's characterization is deeply compelling, with his trauma and motivations rendered through specific, embodied details. The internal conflict is vivid and earned. The single weakness is the repeated use of the clinical term "somatic markers," which reads as diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the immediacy of his experience, especially in the otherwise powerful gull rescue scene.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's poetic logic. Mara's motivation—fleeing a world that turned faces to masks—is established immediately and provides a powerful frame for her final choice to "keep the faces." Her interiority is embodied in specific, non-clichéd language ("luminescent ache," "habitual dimming"), and her defining trait of questioning the unquestionable drives the entire plot. The final change is earned by her engagement with the keeper's puzzle, representing a profound shift from retreat to responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent internal contradiction of "serene anger." Motivation is both philosophical and deeply personal, driving the entire narrative without faltering. The final act of renunciation is a perfect expression of the established traits, earned through a consistent worldview where "taming is a kind of theft," making the cost both visible and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt. The core internal conflict—"faithful to preservation and starving for escape"—is not just stated but embodied in every observation and hesitation. The final choice is earned through this sustained, nuanced tension, and its cost is made legible in the line "releasing it would melt the disciplined ice of my trade." The interiority is poetic and character-particular, avoiding all stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is flawlessly rendered, with a clear motivation and a palpable internal conflict between her inherited skills and her chosen pacifism. Her choices are direct embodiments of her philosophy, not just descriptions of it. The transformation of the visiting trio is earned entirely through her consistent, pressure-tested character actions, making her endurance feel like a victory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is established with remarkable economy and depth through the central metaphor of a "cool-headed fisher." Motivation is clear, potent, and drives the entire narrative arc. The internal contradiction in "cool-headed is what they call me, but calm is a net you mend every hour" provides a flicker of vulnerability that grounds the mythic voice, making the narrator's steadiness an active, earned state rather than a passive trait.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation is established through her heritage and profession ("proofreading margins... studying skies"), creating a believable path to her final, high-stakes choice. The shift from observer to actor is earned through the story's central test, and the final image of the pen nib as "a small spike" powerfully lands her transformation with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to atone for a past failure to listen—is powerfully established and consistently drives their actions. The internal conflict between avoidance and confrontation is beautifully dramatized, culminating in an earned and resonant final choice to tattoo themself. The shift from trying to quiet external dissonance to accepting their own is a mark of a mature, well-realized character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s characterization is exceptional, with a deeply integrated voice and motivation. The stated trait of being "socially perceptive" is not just a label; it's decisively dramatized in the pivotal intervention with the bearded man, which feels both earned and necessary. The brief backstory about the grandmother and the tile flake is efficient, anchoring a core symbolic object to the narrator's belief system and actions, thus fulfilling the BRR policy perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict—"undecided between heat and frost"—is not just stated but embodied in every action. The motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is a powerful, specific engine for the plot. The character's contradictory nature is dramatized with nuance in the climax, where mercy is delivered as a difficult, binding labor rather than a soft absolution, earning the story's final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is strong, with the protagonist’s synesthetic interiority providing a unique and consistent filter for the world. Motivation is clear—a shared duty of care for a fragile past. The relationship with the ghost is well-realized through their collaborative ritual, and the brief memory of the mother adds a crucial, earned layer of personal history and stakes right before the close. The ghost's motivation is slightly more told than shown, but it functions effectively as the protagonist's interpretation of their shared purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is strong and specific, particularly Mara as the "affectionate skeptic," whose internal conflict is shown, not told. Motivations are clear and poignant. The only slight weakness is the narrator's line, "the trick is kindness, and the kindness is a method, and the method is the cure," which verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening a moment of earned emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character's motivation is established immediately and serves as a powerful, consistent engine for the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is superb. The narrator’s motivation is established with poetic precision ("the script I was given read like a lock, and I want a key that turns both ways"), driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict between sworn duty and quiet inspiration is embodied in the central action, and the final shift in the narrator's oath ("from counting to keeping, from keeping to offering") represents a fully earned, resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ansel’s characterization is strong, with his internal state of cautious hope and weariness embodied effectively through his physical scars and reliance on the pillbox. The motivation to fix what is broken is clear and drives the narrative to a well-earned conclusion. The final choice feels like a genuine, costly realignment of his values, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the score is capped just below the 9-band due to Len’s dialogue, which borders on articulating Ansel’s internal arc for him.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary. The coachman's interiority is established through concrete, specific perception ("trusted decisions that surfaced through ambient awareness") rather than summary. His motivation is anchored to a past promise, and his change—seeing the hills as "breathing" instead of "burdens"—is earned through the central, shared action, providing a clear and resonant arc with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    The potter's characterization is exceptional, defined by a unity of thought, action, and motivation. Her internal state is embodied through specific, craft-related metaphors ("breath measured like a slow kick wheel"), making her profession integral to her worldview. The central choice—to offer kindness rather than to conquer or simply observe—is compelled by her established traits and culminates in an earned change in understanding, fulfilling the narrative arc with a quiet, powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is a major strength. The protagonist's motivation is clear, deeply rooted in grief and legacy, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic detail. The central contradiction of being "wistfully pragmatic" is beautifully dramatized. The final choice is earned, but the penultimate paragraph's abstract articulation ("Protected vulnerability is not a posture but an architecture...") verges on a diagnostic label, slightly undermining the embodied emotion that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation to “translate isolation into independence” is not merely stated but dramatized and earned. Interiority is consistently specific and lyrical, avoiding cliché. The final action—singing the herd song—is perfectly rooted in the established backstory of a past life, making the climactic choice feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her internal arc—from seeing her methods as "charms" to understanding them as "bridges"—is earned and satisfying. Her pivotal choice to reveal the unsent letters is a powerful expression of her role as a "keeper of secrets" who understands when they need air. The lovers function effectively as symbolic figures, their lack of deep characterization focusing the narrative on the process of connection itself, which is a valid and well-executed choice for a story of this nature.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored in the “cautiously hopeful” nature that requires evidence before action. The internal conflict is dramatized, not stated, through the tension between professional skepticism and a growing sense of duty. The final choice of “breakfast without chair” is a masterful micro-choice that embodies the character’s renunciation of power for authenticity, earning the story’s resolution with a quiet, concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a potent and immediate internal conflict. The opening lines establish a contradictory nature ("claustrophobic explorer," "prudently adventurous") that is then consistently dramatized through action. The motivation is clear, and the protagonist's specific worldview ("maps were promises that rooms made with the sky") shapes her tactics. The final choice to use the key is a perfect culmination of the "wistful rebellion" trait, earning a meaningful change in understanding with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the narrative method. The prosopagnosia isn't a gimmick but the engine of their unique perception and motivation, creating a compelling internal logic. The contradiction between seeing and naming is beautifully embodied in the line "I draw the way riverbeds remember water," and this philosophy drives every choice with unwavering consistency, earning the final, costly renunciation of a simple answer.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation and voice are exceptionally clear and consistent. Their transition from nervous investigator to defiant steward is earned and satisfying. The antagonist Director is slightly one-dimensional, a functional but thin representation of control, which is a minor weakness in an otherwise strong character landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, potent, and rooted in a deftly sketched relationship. The shift from "luminous disbelief" to active faith is earned through a series of concrete actions and discoveries.

The final action is a perfect synthesis of the character's unique skill and emotional drive, meeting the 9+ standard with a deeply felt cost and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation and voice are exceptionally clear and consistent. The interiority is poetic and particular, avoiding cliché. The primary conflict between the narrator's inherited ethos and the investors' demands is well-established, though its peak is slightly summarized rather than dramatized in a discrete scene of choice, which keeps this just shy of a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's motivation to decode the temple inscriptions is established with compelling interiority, and their core identity as a "lucid dream chronicler" who "heals with words" feels earned. The internal conflict over the telegram provides a concrete anchor for their fear and hope. Mara serves as an effective catalyst, bringing a fierce, embodied need that forces the narrator's practice into a shared, higher-stakes context.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, defined by a core contradiction—"guarded druid" and "warlike serenity"—that is consistently embodied rather than stated. The motivation is clear and operates on two levels: a professional duty and a personal need to find truths beyond surfaces. The final, subtle shift ("my guarded heart unbends one unmilitant notch") is earned and deeply resonant, showing change without sacrificing the established core identity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, moving from a passive, “purposefully curious” state to active choice. The internal conflict is elegantly captured in the shift from “almost heed” to “chose to heed,” marking a decisive turn. The embodied emotion of “anxious elation” is a strong, character-particular touchstone, but the characterization remains somewhat archetypal, serving the fable-like quality of the story rather than achieving deep personal specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's motivation to "patch holes in the soul" is established immediately and tested through action. The internal conflict of being a "reckless idealist" is not just stated but embodied, maturing into a sustainable practice by the end—"the foolishness had learned how to hold its breath." The final choice to plant the grandmother's stories is a powerful, earned renunciation that demonstrates a profound shift with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's internal conflict between professional detachment and personal grief is rendered with specific, embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation, a blend of professional duty, grief, and "haunted ambitions," is specific and deeply felt. The internal conflict is dramatized through the core task, resolving in an earned epiphany that re-frames ambition as companionship. The change from wanting to "own transition" to "keep company as it bridged" is a subtle, profound arc, with the cost felt in the line "measure the vacuum that remains."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's conceptual framework. The librarian's motivation to "preserve wonder in routine" is not just stated but embodied in every action, from gathering words in the creel to the final, patient reaffirmation of their purpose. The "hinge-hearted" nature is demonstrated through a blend of mechanical precision and profound empathy, making the final choice to create a "migratory" name feel both inevitable and earned. The woman, while less developed, serves as a perfect catalyst, her fluctuating state providing the crucible in which the librarian's philosophy is tested and proven.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, creating a potent internal conflict between professional duty and a deeper calling. The choice to abandon the former for the latter is earned through the story’s central discovery. A minor deduction is for the final paragraphs, where the character’s self-analysis feels slightly too neat and articulate, bordering on summarizing the story's theme rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation for self-forgiveness is embodied in every action, and his interiority is rendered with specific, poetic language that feels earned by his "river chronicler" profession. The internal conflict between his methodical nature and the daring emotional quest is palpable and resolves beautifully, with the final shift in perspective feeling both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the transformation from "dreamer" to "messenger" is earned through on-page actions. The interiority is rich with a distinct, particular texture. However, the internal conflict lacks a moment of sharp contradiction in-scene; the protagonist proceeds with a determined, almost serene competence, which slightly softens the sense of struggle and makes the final triumph feel more inevitable than hard-won against a deeply-felt internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional. Ilya’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in the potent internal conflict between professional duty and a deeply personal promise. The contradiction is dramatized with concrete, embodied emotion—"the mulberry ache of decision bruise his ribs"—and the final choice is a perfectly earned culmination of this pressure, not a sudden reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator’s motivation and interiority are rendered with exceptional clarity and specificity. The voice is rooted in the unique profession of a “beautician mortician,” where contradictory impulses—professional calm and personal grief—act simultaneously and convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic specificity. Her central contradiction—seeking a final "source" of contentment while her nature is that of a "caretaker" who tends to processes—is resolved with an earned change.

The final acceptance of her ongoing role is a credible and moving transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's professional identity as a "conscience for hire" is established with a unique, consistent voice. Lark's core conflict is embodied in the phrase "sincerely insincere," a contradiction that is dramatized rather than just stated, culminating in a choice that credibly confronts her practiced performances. The final decision feels earned, flowing directly from her articulated desire for her people to "accept both the rescue and the rot."

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with the narrator’s interiority rendered in vivid, specific sensory language (“Patience tasted of lake smoke and copper”).

The researcher is a compelling mentor figure, with his backwards aging providing a deep, resonant mystery that complements the central theme. The final choice feels like an inevitable, earned evolution of the narrator's initial desire.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is established immediately and serves as the story's spine. Interiority is rendered through a consistent, specific perceptual filter rather than direct emotional labels.

The character reads as a fully realized archetype, where the particularity of the craft and voice individualizes them perfectly for this narrative's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with exceptional clarity and specificity, moving from a negative state ("underachieving") toward a positive, if undefined, goal ("a spark not optimized"). The internal conflict between the shame of failure and the hope for an alternative is embodied in the physical climb. The final change—from wanting to be a successful "mage" to becoming a "caretaker of questions"—is an earned reconfiguration, not a simple fix, with the cost of remaining an "apprentice forever" made explicit and accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is both esoteric and deeply grounded in their character, particularly through the superb line: "I am not superstitious, but I am the sort of person who hides behind truth, hoping it will shield me from its shadow."

    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's journey from "stellar doubt" and the "old shame of my title" to accepting their role in a world where "causality ran uphill" is earned and compelling. The internal conflict is embodied through sensory details and reluctant action, while Sori's "quietly enthusiastic" presence provides a perfect, stabilizing counterpoint without needing extensive development. The final shift feels like a genuine, earned epiphany, not a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    The reaper’s motivation is intensely clear and sustained, rooted in a specific, devastating loss.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb, establishing Efan’s core trait as a “lukewarm mage” who is effective precisely because he lacks burning certainty.

This contradictory impulse is held in perfect tension and paid off by the quiet, humble nature of his success.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The warden's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in his relationship with his mentor and his professional duty.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Iri’s core conflict—harmonizing logic and intuition—is not just stated but embodied in every micro-choice: having formulas ready but listening to birds, lighting a warm flame to illuminate a cold crystal.

The "secretly sentimental" ribbon is a specific, potent action that deepens her without summarizing her.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's internal conflict—professional duty versus the personal memory of failure—is embodied with precision and depth. The contradictory impulses are shown acting simultaneously, particularly in the moment of communication with the pilot, where competence and anxiety coexist. The final emotional state, "a harness adjusted rather than a dismissal," is a perfectly earned and nuanced resolution, showing change without a simplistic erasure of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly the narrator's. The motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" provides a powerful internal drive that is credibly resolved through the story's climax. The internal conflict is beautifully embodied in the "frost after the void," and the final choice earns the emotional release. Neri and Rae are slightly archetypal as complementary opposites, but this is a deliberate choice that serves the thematic structure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clearly defined internal conflict between artistic integrity and commercial pressure. Her motivation to "safeguard space for innovation" is not merely stated but embodied in every choice, from closing early to planting the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, established through action and purpose rather than exposition. The central contradiction of "mournfully eager" is beautifully sustained, embodying a complex emotional state without resorting to labels.

The character is a memorable, fully realized creation within a compressed space.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation—to reconcile a state of "dimensional homesickness"—is established immediately and drives every action with superb clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    The deckhand's motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in a choice that feels earned. The "resiliently positive" trait is demonstrated through action—polishing rails, greeting ghosts—rather than just stated. The choice to have the radio voice articulate his deepest desire ("You want to merge parallel timelines... because you are tired of losing arrivals") is a slight externalization, but his immediate, whispered agreement makes it feel like a necessary confession, a truth he couldn't admit even to himself. The final choice feels like a perfect synthesis of his resilience and his desire for meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    The characters are potent archetypes in a fable-like narrative, with motivations that are clear and consistent. The architect's internal conflict is revealed effectively in a single, powerful beat ("He felt anger erupt quietly"). The curator's arc from skeptical observer to participant is subtle and believable. While the characterization serves the story's heady concepts more than psychological realism, this is a masterful stylistic choice, not a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and resonant—a desire for transcendent knowledge (“starlight they cannot see”) grounded in the mundane reality of their profession. Interiority is rendered with poetic precision, capturing a mind that sees the sea as an “inward” sky. The final shift from wanting escape to understanding one’s place is an earned and profound change, with the cost being the renunciation of a simpler, more romantic dream of the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation and interiority are distinct and compelling, particularly in lines like "listening becomes a structure I can walk through." The characterization is strong and consistent, driving the narrative through curiosity and empathy. The final sentence's self-assessment ("incidental heroism") feels slightly too diagnostic, a minor step back from the embodied experience that otherwise defines the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of a "claustrophobic spelunker" is not merely stated but viscerally embodied in choices and physical reactions, such as measuring an air seam with her lips. The motivation to "Return what I took" is complicated by guilt and compulsion, and the final, earned decision to leave the gold fleck behind marks a significant, resonant change, catalyzed perfectly by the discovered message.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation to “fetch wisdom from failure” is exceptionally clear and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is masterful for this length. The storyteller's motivation is clear and their interiority is expressed through a unique, compelling voice. The line "a curse is only a contract without punctuation, and I had learned to supply the pauses" reveals a deep, specific worldview that perfectly informs the story's climax and resolution. The final choice to stay is an earned and resonant act of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrator's motivation is established as professional ("cryptid researcher") but deepens into a beautifully articulated personal mission: "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke." This shift is earned through interaction with the story's phenomena. The final choice to become a "keeper" is a profound and credible character change, sealed by the cost of being "kept," which perfectly forecloses the path of the detached observer.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear, deeply felt motivation that drives every choice. The internal conflict between resonant longing and cautious subtlety is beautifully dramatized, particularly in the decision to use the locust shell as a mute. The protagonist's voice is lyrical and specific, and their final earned stance feels inevitable. The final sentence, "I, the sky-bridge violinist, breathe tarnished wonder restored," verges on summarizing the arc, which is a minuscule slip in an otherwise flawless portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, nuanced, and enacted through costly choices. The central trait of being "respectfully rebellious" is not just stated but demonstrated in the decision to stay with Mina and, crucially, to deliver the unsanctioned letter. The final change in his understanding of his role is earned through the events in the scene, not asserted as an unearned epiphany, fulfilling the story's arc with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carpenter's motivation "to interpret silence as possibility" is established early and provides a consistent throughline for his actions. The shift from mechanical repair to resonant singing is a significant change, though it borders on an unearned epiphany rather than a choice born from deep internal conflict. While his persistence is well-demonstrated, the character serves more as a quiet, archetypal vessel for the story's theme than a complex individual with contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, defined by a distinct and consistent interiority. Motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal history (the mother, the mentor), driving the central action with quiet conviction. The change is not a dramatic reversal but an earned deepening of understanding, fitting the story's contemplative tone and culminating in a resonant final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.6)

The protagonist's internal conflict between desire and fear is embodied in concrete actions—bringing the hair, following the locksmith, and finally singing. The final choice is an earned transformation, moving from a character defined by a "silence that would not open" to one whose "song continuing" is payment, a profound and credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal history, while her professional identity as a "hands-on folklorist" provides a specific, active lens for the story. The internal conflict between academic method and emotional truth is expertly handled, culminating in a confession that feels both surprising and inevitable. This final choice is earned by prior causality and comes with the visible cost of an incomplete recovery, making the change credible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, defined by a distinct voice and a compelling internal conflict. The contradiction between professional resolve and personal anxiety is masterfully embodied in the action of "rehearsing retreat to defend presence." This single line demonstrates a complex interiority acting under pressure, making the narrator's final, quiet victory deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miren's characterization is consistent, and her motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is beautifully dramatized. Her interiority is concrete and poetic, avoiding cliché. The characterization is powerful and unified, though it stops short of depicting a deep, contradictory internal conflict, which keeps it from a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's characterization is expertly established through their unique profession and specialized tools. Motivation is pristine and drives the entire narrative arc without wavering. Interiority is poetic and particular, avoiding cliché; the narrator's competence is credible, balanced by a single, sharp moment of physical vulnerability ("I almost fell") that grounds them effectively. The final choice to face the mask demonstrates an earned change, turning the "rush of ghosts" into stable "footing," fulfilling the 9+ test for an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.6)

The final choice to frame the map with the tear visible is a perfect, earned culmination of the narrator's established values, providing a costly but meaningful form of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a protagonist whose professional detachment is in constant, subtle tension with a deep empathy. The internal conflict is beautifully rendered, not through summary, but through embodied action, as when the narrator's hand "wanted to round every letter as if smoothing a child's hair." The final choice to take the snow globe is an earned, decisive shift from pure observation to compassionate intervention, with the cost of "sorrow" made explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a clear motivation ("articulate unspoken needs") that deepens with personal history ("I knew thirst that had learned to sing quietly"). The narrator's interiority is consistently poetic and embodied, aligning their skills as a balladeer with the task of translation. The final shift in self-perception from "singer" to "hinge" is a powerful, earned reconfiguration of identity that serves as the story's emotional closure, reflecting a cost in personal artistry for communal function.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and their interiority is rendered in a distinct, poetic voice. The arc from detached servant to committed custodian is earned. However, the character reads as an almost flawless philosophical observer from the start; there's little evidence of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle in the moment, which makes the final, noble choice feel slightly inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and deeply integrated with the central action. The internal conflict between a personal, inherited worldview and a professional, quantitative one is dramatized through the specific act of "categorizing clouds by emotion." The final choice to memorialize the night in the log via this method is a perfectly earned culmination of this conflict, with the professional risk serving as a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The artist's motivation is clear and deepens from a professional goal to a legacy-defining act. The prosopagnosia is brilliantly integrated not as a simple trait but as a unique perceptual filter that enables the final artistic achievement, as when the artist recognizes the sky by "the weight of light at evening." The internal state is embodied through precise actions and sensory details, culminating in the masterful sequence of testing limits, which demonstrates an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The apprentice's motivation is established through their specific actions—sleeping under charts, waking with compass dust—rather than abstract labels. The internal state is rendered with vivid, embodied imagery ("my ribs were lantern slats and my hands rang like bowls"), and the final choice to trust the pattern is a perfect culmination of the "diligently curious" trait established from the start. This feels like a complete and earned micro-arc, perfectly scaled for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith's motivation is established with poetic precision and deepens into a nuanced understanding of his craft. His interiority is consistently embodied through tangible metaphors like "driftwood nostalgia."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The collective "we" narrator is effectively established as a single entity, but lacks the internal contradiction and specific flaws of a singular protagonist. The primary internal conflict ("We argued, because hope here is brambled") is stated rather than dramatized through competing actions in a scene. The transformation to unity is believable within the story's lyric mode, but the shift relies on the external crisis rather than a more granular internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied sense of duty ("bruised awe lived under my ribs"), and their internal state is rendered with poetic precision. The key piece of backstory—the mother's phrase "beautifully flawed"—is not just color; it functions as a "useful gear," directly enabling the climactic action of forgiving the machine and the world. The final choice to sing is a perfect culmination of this established ethos, making the change from technician to 'vow-maker' feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator’s motivation is established with powerful economy in the first two paragraphs, rooting their duty in a past grief. The internal state of reluctant, knowledgeable servitude is brilliantly maintained, showing contradictory impulses (the promise to leave vs. the duty to stay) without needing to summarize them.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.7)

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.6)

Interiority is rendered with a unique, consistent voice, and the final choice to offer their "ledger" and "unfinishedness" is a perfectly earned and resonant action for a "clean slate vendor."

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's voice and motivation are established with exceptional clarity and poetic force from the first lines. Interiority is consistently expressed through the unique sensory lens of tasting memories, which avoids cliché and provides a concrete mechanism for empathy and action.

The chef's self-aware choice—"careful not to frame myself as savior"—adds a layer of complexity that elevates the character beyond a simple miracle-worker.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's characterization is clear and consistent with her motivations, but relies on telling at key moments. The line "Because she is empathetically decisive, no one feels bulldozed" is a diagnostic label that summarizes her core trait rather than letting the prior scene of her gathering support fully embody it. Her competence is admirable but lacks a moment of genuine internal struggle or a complicating flaw, making her slightly more of an archetype than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's interiority is exceptionally well-realized, with motivations that are both intellectually specific ("helix-minded engineer") and emotionally resonant (grief over the colleague).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is the clear engine of the story, and their internal journey from ambitious "symphonically minded" creator to empathetic companion is rendered with precision. The key choice to "surrender cleverness" provides a strong, earned change with a felt cost. The characterization is slightly weakened by the repeated use of the abstract label "empathy in motion," which verges on diagnostic self-awareness rather than purely embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation—"to learn how difficult beauty survives"—is established with nuance and directly informs the story's central action. The contradictory impulses of a renowned tutor who wishes to be "mute" are resolved through a non-verbal game.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation as an "eclectic pacifist" is consistently and compellingly demonstrated through their choice of tools and methods. Interiority is rich with specific, character-particular metaphors. The primary weakness is a tendency towards over-articulated self-awareness, such as the line "That is pacifism as technique...", which reads more like a thesis statement than an organic realization, slightly flattening the earned moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is established early and provides a clear, consistent drive. The internal conflict is elegantly dramatized through the choice to embrace a feared, "rank" solution for the communal good.

The interiority is rich and specific, rooted in the unique olfactory sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored effectively by the grandmother's legacy. The final choice to plant the "fused heart" demonstrates an earned change from seeking a static source to tending a dynamic practice. While interiority is beautifully expressed through poetic perception, it lacks a strong sense of internal contradiction or flaw, making the protagonist feel more like a perfect vessel for the theme than a complex individual struggling with it.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exemplary and deeply integrated with the story's core concept. The protagonist's motivation ("to cultivate foresight in action") is not just stated but demonstrated through every methodical choice. Interiority is sharp and specific, avoiding cliché ("Silence gives you unshared custody of attention"). The interaction with the child reveals a professional empathy that is both efficient and humane, and the final choice to inventory rather than celebrate perfectly closes the character's arc of practiced vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell ringer's motivation is clear and consistent, but the character reads more as a vessel for the story's concept than a fully realized individual. The internal conflict—remembering the city—is a crucial beat that reinforces the stakes, but it's a brief, solitary moment of interiority. While beautifully executed, the characterization lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is established early and drives a compelling internal arc from guilt to humble mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    The courier’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a compelling internal contradiction: a “jittery” nature paired with a job requiring immense stillness and focus. Motivation is clear and deeply felt, rooted in the legacy of an absent mentor. The final beat, where the narrator feels the mentor’s presence and immediate absence, provides a poignant and earned emotional cost that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The mystic’s voice is distinct and authoritative, while Mara’s transformation from skeptic to believer is earned and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Iven’s characterization is superb, a study in quiet strength. His motivation to “coax resilience from rubble” is established early and drives every action, culminating in the powerful, embodied cost of bartering his memories. The story earns his final smile and the description of his defiance as “azure because it reflected the sky.” The choice to filter his interiority through a collective “we” narrator maintains a mythic distance that works for the tone, though it slightly mutes any potential for sharp internal contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority seamlessly fused through the unique lens of a "sensory map maker."

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is concrete and powerfully rendered, with contradictory impulses—grief, artistic duty, and suppressed courage—acting in the climactic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The summoner's motivation is pristine and their actions are consistent, but the characterization leans more toward a flawless archetype than a person with internal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is specific and compelling, especially for Marek, whose "logically emotional" nature consistently drives his unconventional tactics. The seeker's transformation is the pivotal event, and while emotionally resonant, its speed relies heavily on the story's magical premise, making it feel slightly convenient. The line "sorrow is the truest data" is a diagnostic summary that momentarily pulls away from Marek's established voice into a more authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "sculpt patience" is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. Interiority is vivid and particular, avoiding cliché. The character is established as a competent sage, and their actions align perfectly with their philosophy; however, the lack of a significant internal contradiction or flaw revealed under pressure makes them slightly archetypal, preventing a higher score. The change is external (in the villagers), earned through the narrator's steadfastness rather than an internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is expertly rendered, balancing professional duty against an emergent moral clarity. The internal conflict between the algorithm's preference and "fidelity to lives" is potent and dramatized through concrete choices, like turning off the radio. The backstory of the father is integrated economically via the BRR rule, anchoring in the lantern's vision and tilting the final stance without halting momentum. The shift from a required calm to a chosen calm is a subtle, masterfully executed character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through resonant, philosophical dialogue that reveals deep-seated motivations without exposition. Both the chaplain and proprietor are rendered with immense specificity and credibility in a short space. The internal conflict is made tangible and moves from the chaplain's quiet observation of the "thorn" to his decisive, changed counsel to Jonah.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The central contradiction of Ilex's personality—"irreverent as a saint on skates"—is not just stated but consistently dramatized through his actions, from sticking his tongue at the universe to the denied tears at his moment of triumph. His motivation is abstract yet powerfully embodied, making his final, quiet victory feel earned and resonant. The interiority is specific, avoiding cliché and grounding a fantastical concept in a believable emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is established immediately and remains compelling.

The final choice is a perfect crystallization of their arc, moving from a passive "keeper" to an active creator of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator's characterization is superb, established through a consistent voice and a clear, compelling motivation: "to map empathy onto action." Interiority is concrete and particular, especially the rueful reflection on patience as a "stubborn weed that choked urgency," which is then expertly reframed as a core strength. The final choice to stay for a season is an earned act of endurance, demonstrating a cost that validates the entire peacekeeper role. The secondary characters, though brief, serve their purpose effectively by voicing credible, grounded skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's journey from a "euthanasia tourist" to "Doctor Last-Minute" is a powerful internal arc, earned through action and reflection rather than stated. The contradiction between seeking oblivion and learning to listen for life is palpable and embodied. The final choice to delay the appointment is a potent, earned culmination of this change, foreclosing a path with the clear cost of continued uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    The two characters are sharply drawn through their conflict, with the traveler’s internal struggle made tangible in the map and letter. The Sentinel’s archetypal wisdom is grounded by his specific connection to the vines. A minor deduction is for the traveler's dialogue at the end ("You have a gift..."), which feels slightly too on-the-nose in its diagnostic assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is archetypal but potent, fitting the mythic tone. The narrator's motivation to "preserve the echo" is the story's spine, and their shift from guide to student is earned through the walker's quiet competence. The walker himself is powerfully drawn through action and restraint, with his "strangely honest" eyes providing the necessary anchor for trust. The final earned change—the narrator's internalizing of the echo—lands with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's characterization as a "subtle puzzle archivist" is exceptionally coherent and well-realized through a distinct internal voice and methodology. Motivation is clear and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.5)
    The scholar’s motivation is seamlessly integrated with his reticence; his core conflict between hating to speak and needing to testify is not just stated but embodied. The final choice to “testify by playing” the crystal is a brilliant resolution, perfectly earned by his established character as someone who trusts hearing over speaking. The backstory of the paper cuts and the “bruised permission” adds depth with masterful economy, making his commitment feel lived-in and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character's motivation is both unique and deeply felt, driving every action in the story. His central contradiction—being a prophet who forgets the future—is brilliantly dramatized rather than merely stated. The micro-choices, like chalking the statues' mouths and arranging driftwood, are concrete manifestations of his abstract quest, making his interiority tangible. The final earned stasis, where he accepts his cyclical task, shows a profound and credible character resolution without resorting to a simplistic solution.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.6)
    The narrator's characterization is exceptional, defined by a coherent philosophy of patience and listening that is dramatized, not just stated. Interiority is vivid and particular, avoiding cliché ("Cameras are small cities, and a wise mayor listens for the traffic of electrons at midnight"). The final earned shift in perspective, from fixing an instrument to a deeper understanding of listening, feels both profound and inevitable, meeting the 9+ test with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.5)
    Exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation ("to execute a flawless goodbye") is not just stated but embodied in a series of decisive, empathetic micro-choices.

The defining trait, "quietly deliberate," is not merely stated but demonstrated through the methodical ritual with the mirrors, making the final insight feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's central contradiction as a "forgiving skeptic" is not just stated but dramatized in their choice to pocket the tooth and later to believe Ari. Ari's shame is powerfully embodied in his "wrong" hanging arm and how he has been "eroded into someone else," making the narrator's act of mercy both a physical and narrative healing. The motivations are clear, complex, and drive the resolution without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal and communal trauma, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail ("breathe its petal-cool softness like a compass inside my chest"). The central choice to pursue a patient, gentle solution over a quick, dangerous one is earned through the reflection on her brother and the fire. The final act is not just a solution but a complete embodiment of her philosophy, demonstrating a fully realized and compelling internal arc with a clear, felt cost—the enduring absence of her brother.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's interiority is rendered with specific, concrete detail ("watchful dreamer by practice," "numbers ticked like a Geiger counter"), and their motivation is dramatized through action, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.6)

The interiority is consistently rich and particular, avoiding generic introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s internal arc from doubt to belief is clear and provides an emotional core. However, Rowen functions more as a flawless archetypal catalyst than a complex character, and the narrator's doubt resolves with a soft gentleness rather than through a crucible of internal conflict. This thematic purity comes at the cost of deeper characterization, keeping it shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear, embodied, and drives the entire narrative. Interiority is conveyed efficiently through physical action and a single, potent memory of his sister, which provides a deep personal stake without halting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith's characterization is superb, with motivation and action tightly fused. His interiority is revealed through his craft, especially in the line, "he felt the failure like a beat missing in a lock's tumblers under tension," which is a masterclass in embodied thought. The final, costly choice to leave the repaired timer is an earned moment of renunciation that solidifies his arc. The character is slightly archetypal in his quiet competence, which prevents a perfect score but is highly effective for this mythic tale.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and potent motivation established in the opening. The protagonist's internal state is rendered with specific, embodied details, such as the "saltshaken hand" and the trembling "from the recognition," not abstract labels.

The weaver serves as an effective archetypal guide, a perfect foil whose minimal presence magnifies the protagonist's internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. The widow’s motivation to manage grief is clear, and her internal conflict between perfect preservation and acceptance of absence is dramatized through the act of carving.

The line "memory should be trained to come without treats" perfectly crystallizes her new, disciplined relationship with the past.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, with a clear, compelling motivation driving the narrative. The internal conflict between past ambition and present reckoning is made tangible through the negotiation with the ghost. The final change is earned through a series of specific, costly admissions and promises, fulfilling the 9+ test. The voice occasionally borders on a register slightly too poetic for pure interiority, feeling more authorial than character-bound, which is a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and consistent. The voice, rooted in an engineering mindset (“hope was a system”), is perfectly sustained, turning abstract concepts into concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is crystalline and their interiority is rendered with unusual specificity. The voice is deeply integrated with the narrator's philosophical purpose, creating a compelling and consistent persona.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.6)

The narrator’s motivation ("to understand the geography of healing") is a powerful engine for the plot, and their interiority is uniquely poetic.

The choice to teach the boy rather than scold him is a perfect, earned culmination of her internal struggle, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for contradictory impulses resolving into a choice with visible cost (the red thread). The character reads as a complex individual, not a collection of traits.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilias’s core traits, “luminous skeptic” and “realistically imaginative,” are not just labels but are demonstrated through his central choices.

The motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions are a direct extension of his established personality.

    Characterization is precise and deeply felt, particularly the narrator's contradictory impulses of seeking permission while acting without it. The mother's character is powerfully rendered through spare gestures and silence, making her final approval resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the unique interiority (tasting memories) is used effectively to drive the narrative. The chef’s actions align perfectly with their stated goal. The score is held back from the 9-band by a few moments of over-articulated self-awareness, such as the character defining their own rebellion or wisdom ("My rebellion was gentle..."), which reads more like authorial summary than embodied thought mid-action.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Oris's motivation—"to welcome nuance into a certainty"—is established early and drives the entire narrative arc with unwavering clarity. The character's unique nature as a telepathic statue is not a gimmick; it defines a distinct and poetic interiority where thoughts are currents and memory is a tide. The scholar, though off-page, provides effective counter-pressure, and her internal shift feels earned through the overwhelming sensory evidence Oris provides, rather than a simple change of mind.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is exceptional, establishing a coherent and compelling internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is superb, particularly the narrator's internal conflict regarding their own existence ("I do not exist unless someone is looking"). The advisor is a potent, archetypal figure whose motivation ("fear owes me money") is both chilling and compelling. The dynamic is established with fantastic economy, and the narrator's crucial choice to "unbosom" their core vulnerability feels earned and drives the climax perfectly.

    The characterization is superb, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in a philosophical inheritance ("a method of gentle suspicion"). Ossa's interiority is concrete and particular, shown through a "tranquilly perceptive" lens that shapes every observation.

    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, arising organically from her trauma. The interiority is rendered with stunning, specific language—"a name like a bruise," "a purple cathedral under skin"—that avoids all cliché. The final stance, a vow to "keep the measure open and unclean," is a powerful form of Earned Stasis, a renunciation of simple solutions that feels entirely earned by the preceding conflict between her profound understanding and the commander's utilitarianism.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is strong, with the narrator’s voice and motivation ("I belong to whoever needs the horizon to be a sentence") established with poetic precision. The change from a purely technical observer to one "calibrated for kindness" is earned through the central insight of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's internal conflict—the guilt of a forger who tells himself he is "recording the heart"—is palpable and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lantern maker's motivation to transform grief through craft is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent traits like patience and luminosity; interiority is concrete via embodied actions like polishing gems with spit and sleeve, revealing contradictory impulses of torment and calm. The final renunciation of full shadow return feels earned with visible cost in the loosened ache and hoarse laugh. The abbess, as secondary character, applies relevant pressure through guidance, sharpening the protagonist's choices without overshadowing. No stock phrasing mars the emotional progression, which layers realistically through irrational persistence in folding cranes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's motivation to chart skies for belonging feels rooted in traits like sharp-eyed observation, intensifying through micro-choices like adjusting the algorithm, but the pilgrim's traits remain more label-like, with "perpetually surprised" eyes not fully constraining actions. Interiority is concrete via embodied metaphors, such as the hand trembling above paper like a pond, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's guilt and contradictory impulses are embodied through concrete actions like kneeling in the surf and confessing forgeries, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost in tempered regret; Mara's presence as a crucible forces status shifts, though her interiority is limited to dialogue and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator's thoughtful trait is embodied through concrete micro-choices, like using the drawer pull to de-escalate tension during the snagged trade, revealing a hierarchy of values with felt cost in the silence that follows. Interiority is character-specific, with contradictory impulses shown in the careful pacing and worry-polished object, avoiding stock phrasing. Relationships under pressure, such as with Raglen and Della, force subtle status shifts that alter the exchange's state by the end. The final endurance feels earned, recycling mistakes into wisdom without unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority with embodied contradictions, like the "jittery mouth" reflecting lost faith, and the final choice to help the boy earns a credible endurance with felt cost of ongoing regrets; motivation intensifies compellingly through pressure, though occasional diagnostic phrasing like "align heart and action" edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation to kindle empathy after forgetting crimes is clear and intensifies through the journey, culminating in an earned choice to stay with visible cost in the "useful ache." Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in the burning baseball evoking guilt as steam, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. However, occasional stock phrasing like "chewing its softer parts" slightly dilutes character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation to reforge the bond with Mira is clear and intensifies through embodied reluctance, culminating in the earned choice to become a passage with visible cost in losing plain speech. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, shown in the tide pulling at ribs where Mira pressed her thumbs, revealing values under pressure. However, the beasts feel more atmospheric than crucibles for character revelation, slightly limiting depth in relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation to reclaim lost time through atonement is clear and rooted in maternal guilt, with interiority embodied in specific actions like tracing the crack and confessing lapses, showing contradictory impulses of perplexity and resolve. Emotions are contradictory and embodied, as in the throat-closing beauty welcomed amid choking air, avoiding therapy-speak. The final renunciation of seizing time, accepting perpetual perplexity, is earned by prior confessions with felt cost in the chamber. Minor abstraction in some reflections slightly limits full 9+ entry, but closure choice is strongly motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation as a steadfast pacifist is rooted in consistent traits like emotional weight tied to gravity, intensifying through shadow work to compel the high-stakes balance at the door; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses of joy and grief acting simultaneously in the greenhouse scene. Emotions are shown through physical buoyancy rather than labels, aligning actions with motives and revealing character under pressure. The meaningful endurance earns a credible reconfiguration by foreclosing unbalanced paths with felt emotional cost. However, some phrasing veers toward abstract self-awareness, slightly softening the raw embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation as a destitute philanthropist is clear and intensifies through her orchestration of coincidences, culminating in an earned renunciation with felt cost in freeing the bugs and avoiding mythic vanity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation for a silent revolution is clear and rooted in familial legacy, intensifying through inventive actions like using the quill holder to open locks, but interiority relies on poetic abstractions rather than embodied contradictions, weakening emotional depth. Internal conflict shows in the intrigue's subtle tension, yet emotions are more performed via metaphors than contradictorily embodied under stress. The meaningful endurance in guarding consent over fear earns some credit, with the quill holder's warmth in the palm revealing a hierarchy of values at closure. Flaws complicate choices without full moral ambiguity, as the resolution accepts costs obliquely.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in the lingering promise to his brother, intensifying through embodied choices like bracing the aperture, with internal conflict shown in contradictory impulses during the agreement to become part of the patterns. The eel herder's precognitive curse creates a crucible relationship that forces the protagonist's renunciation of chasing her, revealing values with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though emotions occasionally lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw embodiment in peak moments like the brother's landing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet's motivation to understand scars drives consistent, intensifying choices, with embodied emotions like thinning fear into clarity showing contradictory impulses in scene; the caretaker applies secondary pressure through revelations, forcing a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's motivation to forge beauty from anarchy is clear and intensifies through poetic interiority, with molting as a contradictory impulse that pressures the night's urgency; Lio's relationship serves as a crucible, forcing collaborative choices that alter their resistance. Emotions are embodied in copper-scented fragments and chest-pressing palms, revealing values with felt cost in the impending molt. However, some diagnostic self-awareness in peak moments, like pressing to "keep the fragments friendly," edges toward therapy-speak, slightly diluting raw contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pianist's motivation to surprise fate is clear and intensifies through his improvisational actions, rooted in wistful traits that compel the climb and performance; interiority is concrete via embodied longing, like notes of "steely longing," but emotions occasionally lean toward abstract labels without deeper contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)

However, emotions lean abstract without stronger physical degradation under stress, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation as a slow-spoken bonsai tutor is clear and intensifies through embodied regret, with contradictory impulses shown in the reluctance to speak and the eventual release; interiority is concrete, like hands learning "only drift," avoiding stock phrasing.

No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored; the hierarchy of values reveals in micro-choices like tracing the lace and speaking to the sea.


== Grader: Kimi K2 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her reflex to “preprocess reality” is dramatized through sweeping, kneeling, pinning plastic—but the final communal turn diffuses the single-POV crucible and softens the personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“sand chilled my bones”), but the rival’s off-stage presence weakens relationship-as-crucible pressure; final annealing choice is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the survivor’s need to “translate silence into music” drives every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. hope—co-exist in the same beats, and the final “permission to continue” is earned through visible effort and cost. The only limit to 9+ is the absence of a second on-page character to test status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The undertaker’s interiority is embodied and specific—“I measure days by the weight of names”—and his stubborn endurance is dramatized through the meticulous lens-mending. The final promise to the dead carries a felt cost: he etches his mortuary stamp into the desk, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s gentle persistence is embodied in nightly micro-choices—ringing the bell once, pairing teens with elders, standing silent under the arbor—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete: “our nerves stretched thin,” “silence ringing harder than any alarm.” The final stance crystallizes with cost: she polishes the bell until “our faces wobbled there,” a renunciation of anonymity that still carries risk. One slip: the collective “we” occasionally dilutes single-POV interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and embodied, but the “spiritually curious” label surfaces as self-diagnosis rather than dramatized contradiction. The final decant moment shows earned change, yet the past-life mirror feels more narrated than pressured. Micro-choices (dab, exhale, pack) do carry cost, anchoring the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the designer’s grief and curiosity are palpable through tactile detail. Motivation—“to discover the texture of time”—drives every beat, but the final acceptance feels slightly abstract rather than earned by a concrete choice. Micro-choices (licking the shard, stepping onto the submerged bridge) show hierarchy of values, yet the woman’s role as pure interval keeps relational crucible off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and strategic, her chain a constant embodied cost; the moment she knots it as a sling crystallizes her vow. Flaw: the scavenger-enforcers remain faceless obstacles, so status pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the synesthetic “blue is a far drum” line crystallizes the POV. Motivation—recording trust before it breaks—drives every beat and the final imprint. The only drag is a slight drift into abstract self-diagnosis (“betrayal replicates like any living thing”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thief’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“breath carried a hush of luminous disbelief”), motives escalate from curiosity to restorative gift-giving, and the final renunciation of theft is earned by the mentor’s visible cost. Minor slip: the mentor’s sudden reappearance feels slightly under-motivated, nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen’s interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic—his narrated breathing, the bookmark as proxy for absent technician—but the shift from “abandon” to caretaker is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat; the cost is present yet diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“cataloged fears like injuries”), but the brother’s motivation remains abstract—why he hid and why he now needs rescue are asserted rather than dramatized. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“I would keep falling, but now toward us”), satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oracle’s interiority is vivid—salt-stung knuckles, bleeding fingers—yet her contradictory impulses (to finish the map vs. to let the courier go) remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Courier’s shift from skeptic to bearer is credible but compressed; the cost (torn sleeve, lantern lowered) is visible yet light. Overall, characterization is strong but stops just short of the 9+ threshold because the final renunciation is more stated than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“hesitation leaves streaks,” “warm metal cooling in a sink”), but the robot’s arc is more accumulative than causal; the final stance crystallizes rather than decisively changes, so the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply paid.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the registrar’s contradictory impulses—cowardice vs. duty—drive every micro-choice. The final act of public confession carries visible social cost and is earned by prior guilt and eavesdropping. Minor slip: “coward, learning to be freed” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vine-dresser’s interiority is textured and embodied; his pragmatic patience and quiet guilt over the planted marble drive every beat. The final kneel and confession feel earned because earlier rituals and cracks in his hands foreshadow the cost. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jae’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. longing for temporal grace—drives every micro-choice; the moment he inverts the fields to “refract homeward” crystallizes his cost (he sees his own delayed self). The flaw of temporal obsession is embodied, not labeled, and the final touch of the lever is a quiet renunciation that forecloses further proof. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority is vivid and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—shivering shins, cradling the program—yet the final choice to conduct silence feels slightly under-motivated; the baton’s significance arrives late, so the cost is legible but not fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the swallowed-lie metaphor anchors motive. The oracle’s peripheral awareness and fault-tolerance are shown through action (repairing barometer, soot line) rather than labels. The final renunciation—speaking the truth at the margin—earns its cost in shoulder tension and storm arrival. Minor slip: “diagnosis” label appears without embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"my breath tasted of iron," "hands tremble"—and the micro-choice of turning the valve is rooted in layered motives (recklessness, skepticism, filial reckoning). The final renunciation (forgiving the wheel, not the men) is earned and carries visible cost. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present stance. Minor slip: the partner’s whisper is recounted rather than dramatized, blunting the causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s vow of non-interference is embodied in micro-choices—recording the mushroom alphabet, trusting the swan’s folds—yet the interior contradiction (desire to witness vs need to shelter) stays largely reflective rather than enacted under pressure. The final “loosening” of judgment is credible but abstract; cost is felt more as atmospheric erosion than as a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ada’s grief is embodied through the locket’s tactile presence; her micro-choice to let the therapist hold it crystallizes her arc. The therapist’s interiority remains consistent, though secondary. The final lullaby request shows earned change with visible cost—she will now carry the music alone at night.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    The historian’s porous listening is embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching the tapestry, kneeling to the axis—each action aligning with his stated wish and visibly costing him blood from the dragon’s edge. Interior contradiction surfaces only glancingly; the piece leans accumulative rather than causal, so the final renunciation (returning the disk) reads as earned stasis rather than a new decision. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“salted sweet shells with hints,” “sticky with sugar and salt”), but the final renunciation—“I had not changed the town with insight, only with arrangement”—is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt but not fully earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory; the “longitude no map would claim” eyes and her micro-choice to stand and reclaim her name carry visible cost. Father Ilario’s motives—illumination not spectacle—drive every tactic. The husband’s single gesture of palm-on-shoulder is status pressure that alters the final beat. Flaws (grief’s contract) complicate choices and are confronted with earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the homesick ache and need to “invent the orchestra without frightening the silence” drive every micro-choice. The shell, frost staff, and memory-mapping all manifest contradictory impulses (yearning vs. exile) in scene. Final renunciation—listening instead of commanding—earns its cost in the thawing pane and cooled shell. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“shadow refused it”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—feeling-stopping numb vs. tactile hunger—is embodied in each micro-touch (needle, drum, filament) and drives every action; the stitched needle in her pocket is a credible micro-choice with seen cost that seals the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“barometric tremors braided with rumor”), but the final sideways step feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is legible yet muted. The storm-recorder persona is consistent, but the watcher remains a cipher, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the vial and scent memories anchor contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—offering the lantern but accepting the promise—earns a felt cost. A hairline slip: “I grieve the way one does for rain during drought on the lungs” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid & embodied (“the rope smelled of rust and rain”); contradictory impulses visible in desire to examine time yet “without breaking anything that could feel.” The renunciation—braiding past guilt into present strength—lands with palpable cost when the rope warms under consent in the mirror-chamber, meeting the 9+ test despite a stray phrase of therapy-speak earlier (“forgave the version of me”).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The violinist’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“my ears are acoustically perceptive”), but the final stance crystallizes more through lyrical image than a visible micro-choice; the cost is felt yet not dramatized in a single decisive act, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the dealer’s contradictory impulses—commerce vs. caretaking—surface in micro-choices (letting Rhea keep the petal, charging little). The final renunciation of profit for witness feels earned, though the “professionally thorough” trait is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “cautious exuberance” is embodied in micro-choices like forgiving demurrage and pressing the ledger key into Jun’s palm. The contradiction between risk and secrecy is dramatized, not labeled. Yet the dockworker Hideo remains off-stage; his granddaughter’s summary dilutes the relational crucible, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“luminescent ache I could not name”), but the final renunciation—“I would build… but only as an echo of the posture”—is slightly under-cooked; the cost of dedicating his practice is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible forfeiture. Still, contradictory impulses (to graft vs. to listen until “tenderized”) play out in scene, and the posture-as-arbor crystallizes a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“cold rings of reflected breath”); the illustrator’s patience vs. fear tension drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—letting the larva go—pays the cost of borrowed time and is earned by prior obsession. Minor: no second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conjurer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his grief is tactile in the way he handles the glass eyes and fruit. The contradiction between his need for coherence and his refusal of spectacle is dramatized through micro-choices (tying the rope, arranging fruit). The final renunciation—carrying an unsolved theorem—earns its cost because earlier beats show how each ritual fails to deliver reunion. Only the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the dweller’s contradictory wish to remain unseen yet serve is dramatized through micro-choices like retreating behind the stack. The final renunciation—etching an arrow instead of stepping forward—earns its cost from prior causality. Only the girl’s interiority is sketched lightly, keeping the piece within single-POV bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—command vs. release—is embodied in micro-choices (tying knots that sigh loose, stepping aside for jasmine). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits the old identity of arranger and accepts slower, uncertain tending. One slip: “circuitously sincere” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s insomnia and need to “thresh meaning” drive every micro-choice; the moment he pockets the brooch and later relinquishes the gnat crystallizes a visible cost. Interiority is embodied (“paint became the only clean water I trusted”) and contradictory impulses (keep vs. return) act simultaneously in scene. The keeper’s grief and the mother’s apparition pressure a joint renunciation that alters their shared stance. Only the keeper’s backstory drifts into summary, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clairvoyant’s interiority is vivid (“I did not see it coming” refrains) and her micro-choice to reach for the pearl then hesitate shows contradictory impulses. Motivation (guide vs. witness) intensifies, but the final renunciation is slightly under-costed—no bodily or social price is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is precise—catalog drawers “smell of kelp and iron,” the valve clicks “like a key”—and his micro-choice to hand the valve to the woman crystallizes a stance with visible cost: he forfeits sole custodianship of the harbor’s memory. The woman’s embodied exile (“used to march”) supplies pressure that forces his final act. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling certainty, like a sketch trembling toward completion”), but the cartographer’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skeptic’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs”), and the micro-choice to sit in the “quiet room” with Lio crystallizes her arc. Yet the shift from skeptic to disciplined listener is slightly under-motivated; the tile’s arithmetic never visibly tests her doubt, so the renunciation feels more lyrical than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The immortal’s contradictory impulses—boredom vs. hunger for meaning—are dramatized in micro-choices (coaxing space, leaking the rumor, pocketing the fragment). Lio’s presence forces a status shift and a credible softening of refusal, paid for with memories and withheld forgiveness. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—dishonest lineage vs. honest labor—drives every micro-choice; the shoulder-squeeze and ledger-signing crystallize values under pressure. Arman’s silent agency feels slightly under-cooked, muting relationship crucible. Cost is visible in the “blue ink” that now indicts the family trade.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stationer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“I learned to believe only when the lamp drew breath for me”—but the absence of a second character limits relational crucible; the final renunciation of paper for silence is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“my fingertips taste bitter”), motives remain consistent, and the final renunciation of confrontation carries visible cost. The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for memory yet refusing to reclaim his name—play out in the charged silence with the widow. Micro-choice of placing the label on the crate crystallizes stance and forecloses vengeance. Only minor drift: the “filters reality” trait is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The myth-buster’s contradictory impulses—gloomy cheerfulness, trust in ribs over logic—are embodied in micro-choices (winding the peg, thinking of failure to move the compass). Interiority is concrete, but the final renunciation lacks a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nessa’s interiority is vivid—her “loops and ledgers” mind shapes every tactic—and the brother’s scaffold cameo crystallizes the family crucible. The spiral-chip reprise at the end carries palpable cost, sealing her earned stasis. Minor slip: the liaison’s shift from admiration to coolness is inferred rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the inspector’s contradictory impulses—scientific duty vs. personal memory—play out in micro-choices (flicking the ampoule, slowing breath). The final endurance/renunciation (letting the moth go, accepting the hush) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “purposefully curious” is stated rather than dramatized in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artisan’s embodied perception and micro-choices under pressure are vivid; her blindness is not a label but a tactical constraint that forces inventive water-bowl navigation. The final smile and depot’s answering “language of settled wheels” crystallize earned stasis with visible cost. Minor: Mirel remains functional rather than crucible-level, capping relationship depth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The editor’s dry wit and subtle confidence are embodied in micro-choices—fogging the glass, turning the valve—each carrying visible cost. Interior contradiction surfaces in the fear of taming the wild versus trust in listening. The final stance crystallizes as clerk and herald, a renunciation of map-making certainty that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tuner’s interiority is sparse but embodied in gesture—heel-toe pacing, thumb on cracked bronze—showing contradictory impulses: infinite patience vs. urgent ribs. His single decisive choice (asking the town to walk) reconfigures relationships with felt cost: they must keep returning, winter included. The mother’s wary smile and the children’s laughter supply external pressure that alters his stance. Flaw: no interior contradiction voiced in scene; motivation remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—panic “paddles my ribs,” stillness as “a single held note.” Motivation (rescue via scent-math) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to cork the vial and swim back carries visible cost: the temple’s silence is left behind, rescue still uncertain. Minor slip: crew remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup”), but the final renunciation—choosing silence to steer the current—leans more on lyric assertion than on dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied, but the ghost bride’s motivations are relayed more than dramatized; the keeper’s contradictory impulses (to wake the orchard vs. honor the promise) surface late and resolve quietly, so the cost feels muted rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sera’s stubborn optimism is embodied in every micro-choice—sewing names into the tether, pressing the plate into stone—so the final “small, continual yeses” feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“thread bites,” “air shifts”) without slipping into therapy-speak. The only gap: no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; optimism never visibly wavers, so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tense.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet fearing its finality—surface in micro-choices like tracing the stele or fitting the gnomon. The final renunciation (to stay and tend) is earned by prior listening and carries visible cost (abandoning the dig’s official purpose). Minor slip: “faith had not been lost, only interrupted” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pseudonym-creator voice is richly textured and specific, with clear interior contradiction (yearning vs caution) and embodied micro-choices (kneels, traces, balances). Her final renunciation—keeping the envelope suspended—is earned as Charged Poise with visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    The embroiderer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“I pricked my finger, dabbed the thread with red”—but the keeper remains a cipher; no status shift or crucible moment occurs between them. The final acceptance of blame is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard as scar and compass externalizes guilt. Motive—recover the unbruised moment—drives every beat. Final renunciation (not deciding yet) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “cryptic medium” label drifts toward self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the translator’s contradictory impulse—wanting to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” yet fearing the cost—drives every micro-choice. The coral fragment and cast function as extensions of motive, not props. The final renunciation (offering the coral to the bedside) is earned and carries visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the artist’s micro-choice to “project the damaged scenes onto fog and walls” crystallizes motive and stakes. The fresco fragment functions as a charged object that re-weights the final image, though the shift from solitary to communal creation feels slightly under-motivated in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the restorer’s contradictory desire for both precision and curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (tapping the coin, loosening soot while guarding story). The final renunciation—accepting imperfection—carries felt cost, though the shift is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scholar’s interiority is vivid—his “candidly cryptic habit” and pocketed gourd seed anchor motive—but the final choice to stage the garden concert feels slightly under-motivated; we see the spark, not the tipping cost. Kline’s soft-moth eyes and lacewing release give her presence, yet her agency is more emblem than crucible. The earned stasis (standing guard without permission) lands, but the emotional price is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“curated darkness like a library”), but the Gardener’s arrival shifts the arc from solitary struggle to negotiated treaty; the final consent gesture (“shapes of consent in the damp, uncertain air”) crystallizes the change with visible cost—yet the poet’s insomnia remains more asserted than dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hands “carry the polish of years spent listening,” her heartbeat “falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice.” Motivation (preserve forgotten names) is rooted in past failure and drives every micro-choice; the final act of ringing the chime and whispering her own name crystallizes a cost-laden stance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("my own heart thrummed between them"), micro-choices (tuning gates to the catenary) are causally tied to prior stakes, and the final renunciation of naming names carries visible social cost. The single POV remains coherent; the child’s brief presence supplies relational pressure without headcount clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between guarding songs and risking trust is dramatized in the final release of Lark. The reinvention of history is shown through micro-choices (cutting hymn slips, tying the meteorite to Lark) rather than told. Cost is visible: the attic is lost, the past remains but is “learning gentler creases.” Only the violinist remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“featherly determined,” “pressed the seam”), but the father remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent; the final renunciation of descent is earned by prior patterning and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for single-POV.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific (“reading ridgelines and trenches”), embodied emotion surfaces in “midnight shivered the surface into ink,” and the final renunciation—maps that “know when to put the pencil down”—is earned through the night’s causal chain. The only bar to 9+ is that Rin remains largely functional, supplying tools and assent without her own contradictory impulse visible in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heat hums in a key between sorrow and laughter”), but the recollectionist’s choices remain largely observational; the decisive act—scattering seeds to reroute travelers—feels lightly motivated rather than wrestled with. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page, so the final renunciation lacks visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    The analytical performer’s internal calibration—tuning probabilities, cataloging glances—creates consistent micro-choices that tighten the stakes; the reflexive decision to invite the girl to still her flashlight until the tide answers crystallizes agency and cost with embodying precision.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"pivot on wet stone makes meaning"—but the cartographer remains a cipher; their trembling shoulder is the only embodied cue. The final renunciation of exile into vocation is earned by the dance-cost paid on the shoulder-sky. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the dancer’s certainty flattens tension. Still, micro-choices (dot, line, press) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glazier’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands know salt, gull cries”), but the decisive shift—committing to salvage the ferry boards—leans more on lyrical assertion than dramatized contradiction; the boy’s question supplies the only external pressure, so status dynamics remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction and embodied cost are vivid—his “hard softness” and the cracked box as “fragile second heartbeat” externalize guilt. The mother’s arrival crystallizes a status shift: he relinquishes custodianship of the children, a choice that costs him the last token of his “bargained innocence.” Micro-choices (offering the box, repairing the paper hand) reveal a hierarchy of values without therapeutic self-labeling. Only the mother’s interior remains slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—scientific precision vs. ritual hope—play out in micro-choices (spiral placement, bladder release). The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: “our days tipping toward repair” acknowledges risk. Minor slip: “logical dreamer” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartographer’s vow and acute listening are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—pressing ear to lime, sketching rhythms, playing hopscotch squares—each with felt cost of self-erasure when “my name slid away.” Interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory; the final acceptance of legacy’s shawl is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied ("felt tremor in my ribs"; "borrowed heartbeat kept a different tempo") and choices under pressure (breathe to match drip, sing coded lullaby) align with goals. Cost visibly felt when reflection changes from defeat to open window. No stock introspection or label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator’s interiority is specific—ink as weight, hands trained to “hold tension without bruising”—and the slow accretion of decisions under pressure feels embodied. Slight drift occurs where delegates become archetypal (“olive branches and lockpicks,” “red thread”), but each speech-act still lands as an individual micro-choice that tilts the stance toward consensus, so the high-band test is just met.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses—sentiment vs. amorality—are dramatized in the egg-lowering beat; the final slackening in his spine registers cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent. The memory of the child at the museum tilts his present stance, satisfying BRR. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    Chaste courtesan's motivation—harvesting suppressed voices—is visible, body poetic but her interior lacks contradiction mid-scene; choices follow a single arc without tension; Earned Stasis in last lines “learning refuse and still sing” forecloses obedience with felt cost, securing score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sorin’s interior contradiction—urbane polish vs. raw guilt—drives every micro-choice; the moment his hands feel “like tools for theft” crystallizes the flaw. The woman’s arrival and her command of the stick externalize the cost, forcing a credible renunciation. Only the serenity trait stays ornamental, never tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs reverence—play out in micro-choices (kneeling, tying, arranging). The final renunciation of speech in favor of fragile gesture earns the “esoteric realist” label with visible cost: the wing’s fragility mirrors the histories’ impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caster’s interior contradiction—“technically gentle” vs. survivor’s guilt—fuels every micro-choice: testing rope without breaking memory, releasing his own name, then staying to listen. “I lay on the floor… bells said stay, cast, listen” crystallizes the Earned Stasis cost with embodied exhaustion and open ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between duty and self-determination is dramatized through micro-choices (breaking the seal, feeding dreams). The final renunciation—choosing to step into the storm—carries visible cost and is earned by the archive’s recovered verb “to shepherd.”

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise—"frugality is a lens" crystallizes motive; the vow encoded in arithmetic shows contradiction between thrift and devotion. Micro-choice to write his name in faint strokes embodies cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Flaw of mockery toward rites complicates the final pledge, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pacifist narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“I plan mercies with the precision others reserve for war”), but Rell’s transformation is more witnessed than earned; his cellular memory flashback is powerful yet feels externally administered rather than internally compelled, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilen’s interiority is embodied and specific—his carpenter’s mind, the weight of ladders, the hazard of glory—yet the final choice to “teach holding” rather than trap feels slightly under-motivated by prior beats. Noor’s grounded stance and shared breathing create credible relationship pressure. Flaws and contradictions are present but not fully compounded into visible cost at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quartz-eye mender is vividly particular—his quartz eye, daughter’s tin, and wariness of goodbyes shape every move. Interior contradiction (repair mastery vs fatherly failure) is embodied in his refusal to open the tin and his choice to weave the ribbon. Mira functions as apprentice and proxy family, forcing the redefinition of fatherhood through her questions and final playful shove. Cost is visible when the ribbon knot graft holds like an answer, closing a path of silence and guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs self-preservation) are embodied in micro-choices: pressing the cameo to bark, selecting the dullest fruit. The final acceptance of curatorship is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost—the cameo’s burn and the unfinished face left in the tree.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    The linguist’s rescue-mission motive is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to refuse the lamplighter’s bargain and the act of “conjugations like ladders” reveal contradictory impulses. The apprentice rescue feels earned, but the final shift toward rescuing “ourselves” is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—discoverer vs. person—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice shows the twin actually warping action. The final renunciation (“one hand letting go of the ledger”) lands as label, not dramatized cost. Still, the voice’s obsessive cataloging gives a consistent, idiosyncratic pulse that keeps the arc legible.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“palms memorizing the friction’s grammar”); the archivist’s contradictory impulse—order vs. reverence for absence—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (stepping only to the landing) costs him full passage and is earned by prior causality. Flaw: the “warmly methodical” label is asserted more than dramatized until the rope work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete and embodied—e.g., “ribs clatter like thin cups”—and her micro-choices (placing the stone, tracing softened cracks) visibly alter the cave’s state. Motivation stays consistent: find quiet before maps collapse. The final renunciation—closing the petal and marking the corridor—costs her the immediate shelter she just created, earning the change. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt the pavilion remember her laughter”), but the custodian’s contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of isolation is earned yet lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Archivist’s voice is textured and queasy with nostalgia, choices paced to ritual rather than just ink. Interiority stays specific; no generic placeholder feelings. Earns not being only a binder by stepping into rain and trading her own name for audience’s echo—visible cost on page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the fireworks designer’s filtering of fuel, mapping of wind, and micro-choice to “keep the wall awake” reveal a coherent, risk-attuned persona. The relationship with Lark is brief but functions as crucible: her trust in the knot and their shared pact crystallize the final stance. Motivation—defying hopelessness through “serious play”—is dramatized, not stated, and the earned stasis (tying the knot back into patience) carries visible cost. Minor slip: Lark’s voice is not fully distinct from narrator’s.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the chronicler’s “sideways seeing” and tactile handling of the cicada reveal layered motives. The final “Yes” is earned by prior reflection and carries visible relational cost. Minor: the partner’s interiority is only implied, limiting crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“walls make my pulse burr like a trapped moth”), but the father’s shift from bunker-builder to collaborator feels compressed; the porcelain doll’s listening role is charming yet under-exploited in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and particular; the operator’s quiet craft and the mathematician’s turbulence are shown through gesture and silence. The final micro-choice—slowing the gondola—earns its cost in the shared hush. Minor slip: “I think of the singer” is summary rather than dramatized memory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lore-keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“old ache of libraries”), but the final renunciation of the crown is slightly under-motivated; we see the wish to keep options open, yet the cost of refusal is only gestured at rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Tender keeper’s interiority and embodied silence work beautifully; the contradictory impulse—“returning to teach suffocating to breathe”—plays out in the scar-tissue linkage with the girl, yet the trait “burns bridges carefully” is asserted more than it drives live tactics in the final beats, shaving a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the survivor’s IOU scars and tactile handling of the bolt anchor motive. The final choice—signing the console and opening the feed—earns its cost through prior causality and visible ledger dissolution. One slip: the “virtuously mischievous” label is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—shame at ending the dynasty vs. the need to honor the hidden truth—are embodied in the moment he pockets the crank handle “as one weighs a gavel.” Micro-choices (inserting the crank, leaving the seal) crystallize a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The caretaker’s silence functions as pressure, not ornament. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The knight’s interiority is embodied and specific—his soft steps, the cold palm on his face, the murmured allegiance all reveal a layered shift from war to tending. The mother-memory is anchored in the program, not abstract, and the final choice to taste the kernel carries visible cost (foreclosing other futures). Minor: the “bones echoed” line edges toward stock.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s contradictory impulses—methodical caretaking vs. aching refusal to let histories die—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (cataloging dust, photographing the shelf). The final act of writing the addendum and sealing the button is earned by the breadcrumb trail and carries visible cost: the reopened ache of an “unknown” now partially known.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s quiet clerk persona and buried rebel core are embodied in every micro-choice; the moment she pockets the key and later hums “exactly as far as needed” crystallizes her earned, costly stance. Interiority is specific, tactile, and contradictory—fear and resolve coexist in the same breath. The final refusal of hero-brochure fame in favor of being “the hinge” is a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only a sliver of distance remains between performance and raw exposure, keeping it just shy of perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the saxophonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for memory yet sworn to erase it—play out in micro-choices like “feathering breath until the sound is almost only warmth.” The final renunciation (leaving the sentence open) carries visible cost: the teacher’s absence and the ash-scented memory. Only the teacher’s reflection lacks fresh contradiction, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—"mossy delight," "ash sifts like sugar"—but the character’s contradictory impulses (delay vs. eager reach) are more asserted than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of haste is earned by prior ritual pacing and carries visible cost: “laughing under the generous ashen sky” shows altered stance. Still, the voice edges toward lyrical self-diagnosis rather than raw contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“time flinches when touched”), but the shift from broken-clock tinkerer to improvisational apprentice is slightly under-dramatized; the final renunciation of exactness is credible yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—"luminous regret" lodged in the throat, the "ghost tonguing my every step." Micro-choices (etching names, tempering alloy with hair and button) reveal hierarchy of values and visible cost. Motivation to "keep the ledger honest" intensifies and culminates in Earned Stasis: carrying the scar-seamed balance rather than expecting Mara’s return. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of the alchemist identity in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; modest fearlessness threads choices and self-imposed limits. The croc-tooth relic and croc-bite memory anchor motive with felt cost. Final choice to stand aside and yield the woman to her own laughter is a renunciation earned by prior causality. The single POV handles contradictory impulses cleanly, but the secondary on-page presence of the river-crocodile vignette is brief and utilitarian, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"the tilt of my jaw," "muscle flinch and breath timing"—but the final renunciation (knotting the strap as boundary) is slightly under-motivated; the caretaker beat feels grafted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The translator’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“I tasted old resin”—and her micro-choice to speak the child’s name into the canvas is earned by the preceding sensory anchoring. The contradiction between her professional detachment and personal hunger for recovered names is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The felt cost—swallowing “two worlds”—is scaled to the length and forecloses anonymity for the child.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and specific (“dust prints its diary”), embodied tension between duty and morbid curiosity. The final micro-choice—winding the barrel backward—earns its cost, releasing the ghosts with a tangible hush; no relationship crucible on page so status bullets irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Operator’s loneliness, failed quest for a perfect moment, and lonely craft are all embodied through micro-choices (type alignment from frost patterns, decision to print the eternity clause, final sigh). The caretaker’s flaw—destabilizes systems—shapes every beat and is visibly paid in cost when the library shudders.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet-revolutionary’s interior contradiction—failed yet still seduced by collective beauty—embodies the central crisis; each mirror-covering decision re-commits him, costing both official standing and psychic safety. Moments like pressing the shard to his temple dramatize motive, while Ledger’s scorn applies external heat that clarifies stakes. A clear renunciation (endless revolution) closes with credible cost: fracture of the shard and self-acknowledged futility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s dread of dishonesty is embodied in bodily collapse and visceral restoration when truth is spoken; the sacrifice of the shadow is immediate and embodied cost, but the grandmother strand is summary rather than scene, softening interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“compass ticks like a heart that refuses to agree with clocks”), but the father reveal arrives as retrospective summary rather than active contradiction; still, the final renunciation (offering boots and compass) is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sculptor’s interior contradiction—passion for “simplicity” against the baroque task of building the gate—is embodied in micro-choices: selecting driftwood “by whorls,” letting the lantern “pool in palms.” The grandmother–future-girl silhouettes provide pressure on-screen, forcing the climactic vow. One small sag: the phrase “scaffold complexity with simplicity” is repeated three times rather than dramatized anew each time. Cost is felt at dawn when the gate is left behind, a vessel rather than an escape.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the artist’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is dramatized through scent, silence, and pigment. Micro-choices—climbing the scaffold, grinding pigments at dawn—reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation (the murals become doors) is earned by the grandmother’s last postcard, paying visible cost of inherited solitude. Still, agency is more observational than decisive until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Archivist’s motive—uncover truth without relief—drives every micro-choice; embodied tension in “breath a metronome” and kelp-ribbon keeps flaw visible. Grandmother’s return is felt cost, not device. Interior contradiction (duty vs ruinous need) stays active in scene. No stock phrasing; voice remains particular.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iria’s refusal of easy bargains and her embodied labor (grinding kelp, writing on shells) anchor her motives; the amber bottle acts as both promise and constraint. Interiority is concrete—she “listens for footsteps that would not come” and feels the bottle’s ticking—yet the apprentice’s flight is reported, not dramatized, slightly blunting the cost. The final stance—renouncing wishes for shared labor—earns its charge through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the scribe’s contradictory impulse—archive vs. spare the child—drives every beat. The final renunciation (letting stylus go still) is earned by the childhood memory and carries visible cost: the prophecy is left unrecorded, the orchard’s fate deferred. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands furiously tranquil”), but the final renunciation—passing the pattern on—leans more on inherited lore than on a fresh contradiction exposed under pressure; cost is felt yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s “patient jaw” and tactile attention to the rope splice anchor motivation. The final choice—to ring the bell softly instead of triggering sirens—earns its cost through prior micro-choices and the embodied warmth/cold of the rope. Reni functions as pressure, but her arc is slight; still, the narrator’s stance crystallizes with felt restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the janitor’s micro-choices (polishing the lens, kneeling to listen) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance—polishing marks into guidance—earns its cost through prior attention to the station’s ache. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present choices. Minor: the “spiritually curious” label is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The recluse is sketched via interiority and embodied ritual; choices like fully opening the box reconfigure his stance and cost him remaining isolation. Micro-decisions (waiting, placing scraps) carry consistent motive and visible price. However, some beats drift into elegant exposition rather than moment-by-moment choice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“my borrowed heart kept quiet”), but the final renunciation—choosing to wait without numbers—leans more on lyrical assertion than on dramatized contradiction; still, the cost of that stance is felt in the closing image of the boot.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid and embodied; his contradictory impulse—seeking beauty in incompleteness while actively mending—drives every beat. The boy’s grief is rendered through micro-choices (empty spool, chest evens) rather than labels. Final renunciation (letting the kite go) is earned and carries felt cost, though the boy’s arc is slightly less textured.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the caretaker’s contradictory hunger for pattern and respectful company drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—laying the diary beneath the oak—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor slip: the “brazen calm” label is slightly diagnostic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s skepticism is embodied in micro-choices—offering the amber, the eyebrow-raise, the refusal to sign—yet interiority sometimes drifts into abstract summary (“I wanted to understand the chemistry…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation of nostalgia carries visible cost in the closing image, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite occasional over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s interiority is rich and embodied—his thumb finding the pod seam like reins, his listening to gulls as scouts—but the shift from soldier to gardener is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation is felt yet not fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Narrator's tactile, scent-driven sensibility is crisp and embodied, but Harbor remains observation, not agent; her tail-thump is emotive yet doesn't force a choice. Interior contradiction around staying vs leaving simmers but never ignites into a visible micro-choice that changes tactics—the walk to the relay is inevitable. Final stance of "distance is a lens" feels inherited, not wrested from prior motive. Earned endurance present, but cost is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the contradiction between “blessed” and “pariah” is dramatized through micro-choices like dating the blackout and blowing on the line. The final renunciation—trusting the self-drawn north—earns its cost from prior guilt and isolation. A hairline slip: the phrase “unlucky luck” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The thief’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, cautious abandon, catalog of thefts—yet the moral calculus (“take only what harm has taken first”) remains asserted rather than tested in scene. The final swap carries felt cost, but the earlier beats lean on lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“the real blast braided my lungs with phrases no director could erase”), but the shift from victim to archivist is more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation (“I will travel with the nomadic penumbra”) is earned yet slightly abstract, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mercury-glass seer embodies charged poise: her quicksilver eyes refuse certainty, and her precise ritual choices (mirror placement, feather deployment) force the protagonist into the decisive change of willingly retrieving his buried accent. Stakes escalate directly by her intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“exile curl tight around my throat”), but the prince backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly dilutes present pressure; the final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Artist’s interior contradiction—questioning the ritual while participating—drives every beat; the gold-for-memory sacrifice lands as earned cost. Child’s mischief refracts the debt and re-mentors the artist, a credible micro-turn. Mentor backstory is anchored to present touch of bone tower, not summary. Motivation stays legible, though “refract truth” remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interiority is rich and embodied—hands trembling, the metallic weight of promise, kintsugi as action. One friction point: Mira’s death is relayed in summary instead of reactivated choice, so the grief reads as recalled rather than urgent pressure now.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—nostalgia vs. fear—drives every beat; the shell as vow and mirror as split-self are embodied choices that foreclose retreat. The final refusal to stay inside the painting costs the painter the fantasy of completion, felt in the warm shell and unsigned canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the vial cork and whisper-practice anchor contradictory impulses. Mentor’s late-stage silence crystallizes the apprentice’s earned authority, but the mentor’s minimal on-page presence limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The navigator's interiority is concrete ("I feel her voice rise through my ribs"), and embodied contradiction sits between duty and longing. Micro-choices (wrapping the censer foot, following the beacon) flow from a coherent self. Yet late backstory about Mara risks slipping into summary that dilutes the present-tense cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The truffle-forager’s rationality and involuntary honesty drive every beat—smuggling the eye, deflecting inspectors, guiding the group—so motivation is clear and embodied. Interiority is precise (“truth coil up my esophagus”), but the girl’s father anecdote is delivered second-hand, softening the relational crucible. The earned stasis—continuing to forage while the eye “grows warm”—carries visible cost and fits the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s “softly persistent” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fitting the flower, sweeping the notch—each carrying quiet cost. Interiority stays concrete and idiosyncratic; the borrowed memory arrives as sensory flash that tilts present tactics. The final stance crystallizes with felt renunciation: he rescues the gesture but buries its shrine. Minor slip: the girl memory is recounted more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the chip, ants, and doorway all refract the narrator’s ambivalence between stasis and choice. The final step across the ant-bridge crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “empirically intuitive” is asserted more than dramatized in Ruth’s absence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Queen’s hunger to unravel her dreams is embodied in every micro-choice; the stone-self touch crystallizes her refusal to remain a ghost of unasked questions. Interiority is specific, contradictory, and embodied. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she wakes and the wanderer already leaves, power foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“ash-petaled crownlets settle on our hair like moths that have learned metallurgy”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized; the final choice to “return differently” is credible yet feels lightly earned because the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“feral nostalgia baring its teeth”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final bargain with the nostalgia-creature is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"fever smudged my senses," "shy percussion of every drip"—but the aromatherapist’s loss of smell is more backstory than active contradiction; the midwife’s grandson is sketched rather than pressured. The final micro-choice—leaving the empty space in the dish—earns a quiet renunciation with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Scholar’s earnestness and self-doubt ring true; scars thread into interior tension that pushes the memoir-scry act. Character flaws (shame, haste) compound choices and produce visible cost as ink crystallizes under panic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s guilt and self-loathing drive every micro-choice. The apology is dramatized through the séance-like ritual, not declared. The final “Play” choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the column sacrificed, the orchard still doomed. Minor slip: the “gossip-column exorcist” label is asserted more than demonstrated in action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The witness’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“dictionary cracked softly when I opened it at Listen”—but the arc leans more on lyrical accumulation than on a single, causally earned renunciation; the final hinge role feels granted by temple logic rather than by prior flaw or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. heretical curiosity—play out in micro-choices (keying Basin Three, pressing blood to key). The final renunciation (“should remain uncorrected”) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: grandmother’s parlor memory is slightly summary rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—vigilance vs. hospitality—play out in micro-choices (hosting the cat, bracing the strut). The final renunciation of fear-based security is earned and carries felt cost. Kian’s memory is integrated without drifting into summary. Only the “spatially gifted” label feels slightly external.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“grief smell green”), contradictions live in scene, and the final micro-choice—slipping the stub into her notebook—earns the bridge with her father. The compulsive-gambler daughter identity is specific, but the father remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning to help yet guarding estrangement—drives every micro-choice; the final routing of the trapped-child call crystallizes her ethos, but one beat of pure summary after the rescue weakens the cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Archivist’s motive—preserve small moments—drives every micro-choice; interiority is embodied in ink, tide, and salt. The woman’s tremor and locket anchor her stakes, but her interior contradiction is reported rather than dramatized. Final renunciation (stepping back) is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The logistician’s jocular exhaustion and sleep-for-maps trade-off give a sharp, embodied interiority; the final slip of the moon rock into a child’s pocket crystallizes a tender, costly choice. Yet the “we” chorus diffuses individual contradiction, keeping the arc communal rather than personal. Still, motives align with action throughout, and the renunciation of name carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    The blind mapmaker’s tactile perception, interior contradiction, and embodied reaction to ring-cold anchor character throughout; his final kneel-and-touch micro-choice crystallizes “keep listening” into an earned reconfiguration with visible cost on the ring’s sudden silence. No unmotivated epiphanies—every realization is built from earlier sensory data.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tastes like rusted tools and early frost”), but the final shift from guilt to acceptance leans on Del’s guidance rather than a fully earned micro-choice; the pen ritual is more symbolic than causally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s interiority is embodied and specific—signing to water, sketching tide marks—yet the advisor’s whispered counsel remains too abstract to register as active pressure; the final renunciation (empty camera as vow) is earned and costly, but the advisor’s role never crystallizes into a crucible relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arsonist’s motive—burning the library to protect readers—drives every beat; the contradictory impulses (destructive act for preservation) are embodied in the tactile handling of soot and seeds. Micro-choices (aligning tapestry to canvas, stitching the throat) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—carrying the portrait “like a shield”—earns its weight through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction is present ("grief knotted us tighter") and embodied, yet the leap to accepting donor memories feels under-motivated in-scene; emotional specificity dips into therapy-speak ("I would carry what did not belong") and Mira feels summarized rather than pressured. The final nod "blessed them" earns the score without reaching full earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ivo’s embodied knowledge of gait, his tactile map-folding, and the coin-as-pause create a coherent interiority; the wager with Rade crystallizes a value hierarchy (quiet craft over brute noise) with visible social cost when Rade capitulates. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene, but the final choice is earned and forecloses the “shout” path.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s interiority is embodied and specific; the brother’s suicide and the narrator’s shame are anchored in tactile moments. The guardian’s silence and micro-gestures create credible pressure, and the final acceptance of the mirror carries visible cost. Minor slip: “spiralingly calm” leans toward label, not lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“my shoulders remembering dances I had not learned”), but the final self-naming beat is slightly abstract—no contradictory impulse shown in-scene, only stated. Still, the arc from guarded to open is credibly earned through the scrimshaw’s pressure and the whale’s call.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The performer’s interior contradiction—“blank-faced” certification against a felt grief—shows in micro-choices like shutting microphones off or letting petals fall. The climactic silence built with the child is earned by prior moments of staged compliance, and the cost is the unspoken but palpable forfeiture of public triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interior glimpses flicker, but the poet remains archetype more than person; no single contradictory impulse wrestles visibly within one beat. The witness collective blends into choral “we” without differential motives. Renunciation is gestured—“former guard drops badge”—but the cost is reported rather than dramatized within a moment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivo’s interiority is vivid—his colorblind perception rendered through taste and temperature—and his micro-choice to trade brush and smoke for the reed is embodied and costly. The plant-language exchanges with Mira crystallize status and empathy without slipping into exposition. The final renunciation of color-names for rhythm earns its poise through prior causality. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied ("hands powerfully gentle"), but the arc is more observational than choice-driven; the volunteer’s moment is the only visible cost, and the narrator’s own shift is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grief-as-metallurgist interiority is specific and embodied: “metal would not take a polish” stakes the failure. The micro-choice to solder a clasp where the client hesitates reveals character under pressure with visible cost. Final stance crystallizes: a tutor of endings who stays, renunciation earned. Secondary characters only off-stage, so status dynamics waived.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The apprentice’s curiosity is embodied in tactile learning and ledger-keeping; the cartomancer’s motives remain slightly abstract but her measured actions (ribbon to the boy’s wrist, elbow-choice test) reveal a coherent ethic. Interior contradiction surfaces when the apprentice must decide whether to treat the overlay as language or omen. The final image—tape as ribbon festival—earns a quiet renunciation of certainty, paid for by the night’s accumulated fatigue and the woman’s chipped buttons.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory hunger vs humility drives every beat. The child’s plea and the final refusal to publish crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “teacher” label feels slightly external, not fully earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “softly deliberate gait,” the river stone as weight, the tug of vines—yet the decisive sacrifice of her stored dreams feels slightly abstract; we sense the cost but not the full contradiction inside her. The flaw of over-empathy is consistent and drives the climax, but the moment of renunciation is narrated more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the handler’s trembling hands, the chameleon’s color shift, and the micro-choice to “take only what refuses to heal” all reveal layered motives. The final renunciation—shedding ornament to keep kindness readable—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: the broker’s betrayal is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the flaw’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is particular—raw memory of anesthesia, tactile palms, loam-scented breath. Motivation deepens: opening wounds to reach closure while recoiling from being right. Micro-choice—cracking the hourglass—pays visible cost yet the moment feels fractionally under-cooked, cost stated more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“warehouse with mislabeled aisles”), but the final self-revelation arrives more as lyrical assertion than as a choice that visibly forecloses a path; the cost is felt but not dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“shadowed rapture”), micro-choice to let the instrument rest signals earned exhaustion; cost is felt, though backstory blocks (study of star-charts) exceed the BRR cap slightly, shaving 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guard’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere”—but the final renunciation of sleep for stewardship feels slightly under-costed; the emotional contradiction is present yet not fully sharpened under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stray philosopher’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“clutch the gear like a compass that forgot directions”—and the micro-choice to press the gear home crystallizes a value hierarchy (repair vs. ruin) with felt cost. The contradiction between not wanting to fix the tree and the ache that compels it is dramatized in-scene. The gear’s evolution from pupil to teacher gives the character a credible arc without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“ache points outward”), micro-choice to kneel and later to reach is credible, and the final hand-holding shows earned change with cost. Guides remain archetypal, slightly diluting individuality, but protagonist’s contradictory impulses (fear vs reach) are dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority carries a palpable, embodied ache—”wires blooming little sparks,” “metronome of me”—that never reduces to label-speak. The protagonist’s stance remains one of earned endurance: choosing to listen, refusing to absolve the forced silence, paying with literal nerve-fire. Micro-choices (“bolts clicked into the bench,” leaving the faint print on cobalt glass) trace a hierarchy of values without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyr’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his regal bearing and unpretentious robe charges every micro-choice. Serane’s mask-like polish and tremor are shown through gesture, not label. The final renunciation is earned: Serane’s confession and Lyr’s sealing of the scrap visibly foreclose her claim. Only the titan’s “overlooked” trait is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“tapping rhythms…to count swells, to measure fear”). Motivation is clear and intensifies through discovery. The final renunciation—keeping the atlas page separate—carries visible cost and is earned by the preceding causality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s barefoot vulnerability and “awkwardly confident” gait are embodied in every step; her interior contradiction—seeking safety yet courting danger by re-awakening the bay—drives the scene. The micro-choice to close the circuit with her palms crystallizes her hierarchy of values: father’s memory over personal safety. Cost is palpable in the bay’s groan and the siren’s aborted chirp. Only the father remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lida’s contradictory impulses—reverence for tradition vs. insurgent will—are dramatized in every beat: the cane vs. the kite, the oath vs. the vault. Embodied cost (knees to memory, wet-loaf weight) grounds her final choice. Council refusal sharpens her isolation, making the unseal inevitable. Only the council’s generic refusal speech keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rafi’s contradictory impulses—freeze vs. act—are embodied in real time (gull rescue, photo handling). His micro-choices (naming sensations, folding the photo anew) visibly cost him and reconfigure his stance. Leda serves as pressure rather than ornament. The final Earned Stasis—steady hands holding the folded photo—pays the bill for prior trauma without tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s dejection and craft history are vivid, but her shift from painter to lightkeeper occurs almost entirely off-stage; the interior claim of saving her “eye” remains intellectual rather than dramatized. The thread of responsibility to the faces she once failed to paint only glints—never pressed to the skin. Earned stasis is registered, yet the cost is generalized rather than embodied in a lived flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“serene anger keeps my hands steady”), but the mentor’s vanishing is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the causal link to the protagonist’s final refusal. The albino trait remains ornamental; no sensory or social consequence surfaces. The hummingbird’s micro-choices (hovering at the throat) crystallize the cost of vanishing, earning the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—preservation vs liberation—is embodied in micro-choices (warming the seal, feeding the duct) and culminates in a visible cost: the archive’s disciplined ice and the narrator’s future melt. Motives remain character-bound; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. The final “did not know if I had preserved it or set it free” crystallizes the unresolved tension with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied and particular; the narrator’s pacifist restraint is dramatized through micro-choices (asking visitors to sheathe knives, threading stories into irrigation). Contradictory impulses—yearning for father vs. tending strangers—coexist in scene. The final renunciation (to keep the farm open) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: perpetual vigilance and inherited blame. Only the father’s rumored motives remain slightly abstract, preventing a perfect 9.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single POV stays consistent; interiority is embodied through the fisher’s “patience in my mouth” and grip cues. No relationship crucible present. Renunciation choice– to spill the map back without keeping it – is earned by the walk itself and the goddess-negotiated terms. Cost is felt: the coastline only remains whole if the fisher continues to be merely a listener. Emotions are sensory, salty, never labeled. A hairline slip: the reader never sees the goddess in conflict with personal history, only ritual negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The interiority is thick, almost baroque, yet each beat—her wager, the shutter lever, the call to the board—tracks cleanly to her father’s legacy and her own need to prove that observation can equal action. Micro-choice under pressure is clear: sealing the shutters turns her from spectator to actor. Cost is visible in the caretaker’s “gently astonished” slump and the board’s resistance. No significant causal slippage in Q2, so it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The constellation-tattooist’s guilt-driven motivation is embodied in the amber-handling and self-tattooing beats; interior contradiction (hush vs. stay) is dramatized through micro-choices rather than summary. The final act of inking his own wrist crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor drift: the “girl whose laugh had not yet begun” backstory is slightly abstract, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chalk artist’s micro-choices (tilting the pebble, placing the tile) reveal values under pressure. The final renunciation—carrying “nothing” yet bearing the hush—earns its cost through prior listening acts. Minor drift into lyrical self-exegesis keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gentle radical’s interior contradiction—steel arms cradling empathy—remains vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (kneeling, arranging tesserae, renaming) flows from that tension. The boy’s arrival and the four renamed men create immediate pressure that alters relationships and stakes. Cost is felt when the plaza “tightens” and the past “loosens” inside the narrator. Only the retrocognitive trait stays more label than lived constraint, keeping the score just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—synesthetic perception, tactile memory of mother’s hands—yet the ghost remains a cipher whose choices never truly test the narrator; the final “letting go” is more gesture than crucible, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s skepticism and tenderness braid convincingly; her micro-choices (taps, shoulder softening) reveal shifting stakes. The narrator’s desire to retrieve the father’s map and her wish to quiet her brother’s last words are embodied, not declared. Cost is felt when the geode dulls and the rig stills. Interiority stays concrete, though one or two phrases flirt with therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the narrator’s contradictory desire to speak for the unknown yet not own it is dramatized through micro-choices like pressing the fossil to the wall and later leaving it as “resident.” The final renunciation—handing the story over rather than keeping it—carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“hands smell of sand, resin”), but the shift from obedient apprentice to liberating oracle feels slightly under-motivated; the theft is confessed without visible consequence, softening the cost of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ansel’s scarred face, pillbox history, and micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to trace snow-code, weighing ring vs film) render a credible interior arc; the final ring-fit over scarred skin crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Minor drift: “prudently daring” is asserted more than dramatized in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Coachman’s interiority is embodied and specific; the yarn needle as token/tool anchors motive. Relationship with Wren is a crucible that forces the final choice to “write over fear with motion.” Cost is felt when the palimpsest promise settles “like a cloak… warming the scars.” Minor slip: “closely attentive” is repeated label rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is character-specific and embodied ("quiet palms, breath measured like a slow kick wheel"); micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values and foreclose a path (leaves the cups and hum, accepts continuing fragility). Cost is visible in forfeited water and open-handed non-coercion. A hairline slip—momentary bee shimmer lacks causal leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—“I tuck the tooth into my sleeve” shows motive under pressure. The lock-picking beat crystallizes the father-daughter inheritance and stakes. Cost is visible: the click mistaken for the heart deciding not to leave. Slight drift into lyrical summary near the end keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet guarding independence—play out in micro-choices (lighting the wick, angling the sundial). The final stance of “a door held kindly” is earned through the scene’s pressure and costs the narrator the illusion of complete solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghostwriter’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“keeper of secrets walking in prismatic quiet”), but the decisive act—placing the letters beneath the bowl—arrives with only light causal foreshadowing; the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“palms tingled,” “breathed in dust and stubbornness”), but the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized until late; the final renunciation lands with felt cost yet leans on summary rather than live contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—claustrophobia vs compulsion to move—drives every beat; embodied dread (“old tightness rise behind my ribs”) and micro-choices (chalk, pricking stone) keep motive active. The final threading of the key onto the cord crystallizes a stance with visible cost: defiance of the Council. One slip: “wistful rebellion” is named rather than dramatized in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific to the artist’s prosopagnosia; choices (threading the ribbon, refusing to pocket evidence) reveal values. Yet the final stance—sending the painting—lacks on-page friction or cost, so the arc feels slightly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spongey dread clinging to every map”), motives rooted in honoring ancestor drive every micro-choice; the copper-nail insertion is a credible, costly act that forecloses passivity. Minor drift: Liza’s reappearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fiddler’s interiority is vivid and embodied—e.g., “luminous disbelief braids itself through my bow hair”—but the hitchhiker remains a cipher; his motives are relayed second-hand, blurring the relational crucible. The final choice to play the ledger-forgiving note is earned by the glass-flake discovery and the bow’s homing action, so the arc lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“polished calm…sheen learned from years of evasion”), but the final renunciation—lingering to chase the circle—leans more on lyric assertion than on dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—fear of the telegram vs. compulsion to decode—drive micro-choices. Relationship with Mara is a crucible that alters both their stances. Final “yes” to keep witnessing is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The druid’s guarded calm is embodied in micro-choices—spine rising “like a mast,” treaty whispered to the seed—yet interior contradiction stays muted; the final unbending feels earned but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“questions in my ribs”), but the root-bound visionary’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. tetheredness) are asserted more than dramatized in scene; the final vow is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (idealism vs. cost) play out in the moment of planting the seeds. The boy’s shift from iron shoes to hush is credibly earned by the narrator’s micro-choice to trade her name and stories. One slip: the boy’s interiority is ventriloquised once (“fiercely gentle despite the grit”), nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between emotional insulation and the houndstooth scrap is dramatized in the moment of pricing. The final micro-choice—assigning the scrap museum value—earns a credible renunciation of pure detachment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the translator’s tactile trust in grooves over ink, the seed’s warming in the pouch, and the final quieting of “haunted ambitions” all reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. Motivation—meeting the edge where bonds loosen—remains consistent and drives every micro-choice. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A; otherwise characterization is near flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The librarian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hinge-hearted,” “clockwork shoulders click”), and the micro-choice to accept contradictions in order to help the woman reconfigures his stance with visible cost (the bells cool to frost). Yet the woman’s contradictory identities are more asserted than dramatized in scene, keeping the relationship crucible slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“walls between hearts,” “weight less than grief”), but the inspector’s shift from auditor to conduit is slightly under-motivated; the pearl’s warmth and the shell’s voices supply enough pressure to justify the renunciation, yet the emotional cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the chronicler’s guilt and methodical self-interrogation drive every beat. The final renunciation—“I would stop asking it to be me”—is earned by the river’s honest weight and the prior confession of hubris. Minor slip: “storm drunk with certainty” edges toward label-speak, but the body of the piece compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled dreamer's interiority is vivid and embodied—"cautious exuberance brightened my steps"—but the final renunciation (breathing the letter without speaking) is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s interior contradiction—duty to empire vs. promise to the frost-burned maker—drives every micro-choice; the final act of playing the violin until it melts is earned by prior plant-whispered warnings and coffee-stain prophecy. Embodied emotion (mulberry ache bruising ribs) keeps interiority concrete. Cost is visible: he forfeits payment and safety, walking into sunlight with only damp strings left. Telepathy with plants is more label than lived constraint, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. professional composure—play out in micro-choices (placing the chip, tuning the dial). The final renunciation (“we keep only enough shimmer”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Mentor’s absence is still felt as pressure, satisfying the crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker persona is palpable in enacted micro-choices—cutting vines, watering pools, planting map scraps—yet the interior shift from caretaking others to tending her own self-forgiveness is more told than dramatized; final embrace of ongoing stewardship feels earned but lightly staged, capping emotional arc just shy of full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lark’s contradictory impulses—desire to confess yet fear of certainty—are dramatized in the wind-chime scene; the narrator’s micro-choice to accept the shard crystallizes the cost of renouncing easy absolution. Interiority is embodied in the “cloak of doubt” and the hollow mirror, avoiding label-speak. Final stance is earned: she will confess and re-fund the boats, foreclosing political safety.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s interiority is embodied and specific; the “need to be seen” and eventual renunciation are credibly rooted. The researcher’s reverse-aging remains a label rather than a felt constraint, limiting full contradiction. Micro-choice to release the village dam is dramatized with visible cost, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the narrator’s shift from active skimmer to still listener is credibly earned. The arrowhead as inherited tool/prayer crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses the old path. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Slight abstraction in “consent aligned to the old note” keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cold rang like a tiny bell in my teeth”), but the shift from “underachieving” to “caretaker of questions” is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation of ownership is earned yet feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Gorgeous interiority and embodied emotion early; passivity creeps in underwater section—choices are more drift than deliberate reversal. Voice is specific, but agency thins at climax where cost is more epiphany than earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the reaper’s contradictory tenderness and duty drive every micro-choice. The final naming of Shoreless crystallizes his arc with visible cost—he accepts endless labor in place of absolution. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Efan’s “lukewarm” stance—steady, uncertain, non-heroic—drives every micro-choice; the chalked sleeve, reed metronome, and final bell-bridge all spring from this trait. Interiority stays embodied (knees ache, back sings) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is the fisherman, who functions more as chorus than crucible, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The warden’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “precisely humane” trait shows in micro-choices like pausing to name who laid each stone. The final decision to summon townspeople rather than expunge is earned by the trail of photographs and the mentor’s remembered charge, with visible cost in the bureau’s order he must now quietly subvert. One minor slip: the ache stirred by the label is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iri’s interiority is concrete—her pulse-to-palm contact with the earth and the ribbon tied to the branch embody her sentimental streak. The braided motif of logic vs. intuition is dramatized through her refusal to recite formulas, a micro-choice that forecloses the path of pure reason. Cost is felt: she leaves carrying “nothing but balance,” forfeiting the crystal’s power. A hairline slip: the grandmother’s voice arrives as disembodied wisdom rather than earned memory.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the “watcher’s burden” drives micro-choices (testing buckle, tapping code, leaning with the ship). The scarred-pilot relationship supplies relational pressure that alters trust, but the final nod is slightly under-costed compared to the prior failure memory.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ego-death survivor’s interiority is embodied through tactile detail (“taste of river stones”) and contradictory impulses (recorder vs blade). The final choice to award joint custody is earned by prior micro-choices—nightly dialogues with the jar, witnessing the sparring—yet the cost (draining inner frost) is stated more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—“cupped the seed and felt her own nerves sink”—but the final renunciation (locking the annex) is slightly under-cued; the cost is implied rather than dramatized in body or action, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Conductor’s motive—restore lost laughter—is clear and embodied through ritual action; interiority is vivid (“kisses the pull cord handle for luck and for forgiveness”). Yet the absence of on-page family members limits relational crucible; we infer rather than witness the cost to the household, capping depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“dimensionally homesick,” “little climates clinking”), but the guardian’s choices remain opaque; her pivotal decision to accept the narrator’s “willingness to wait” feels granted rather than earned through demonstrated stakes or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority (“stoically sensitive”) is enacted in every micro-move; the moment he presses scarred palm to ember establishes embodied empathy and resolve. Contradictory motives—self-definition vs. inherited obedience—remain simultaneous under pressure. Final breakage of the crozier crystallizes foreclosed path with visible cost (palmskin, burnt staff). Single POV keeps traits coherently singular throughout; no relationship friction needed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“taste the seam where silence stitches storm”), motives cohere, and the final renunciation—leaving the hush and star fragment—carries visible cost. Yet the grandmother’s cameo, though moving, arrives as summoned memory rather than active pressure, softening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid ("broom bristles in the spilled starlight dust") and the choice to keep the tide is earned. Yet the deckhand’s contradictory impulses are mostly narrated rather than dramatized in real time, and the captain’s single nod is the only on-page status shift.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Architect’s interiority is vivid—restlessness under poise, anger under compliance—but the final renunciation (“leave no artifacts, only habits”) feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is implied rather than embodied. Curator’s micro-choice to step beneath the thread is precise and stakes her skepticism, yet her interiority is thinner. Overall, contradictory impulses are dramatized, but the closure’s felt cost is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the instructor’s contradictory pull between safety and wonder is dramatized through the night crawls and the anchor link. The final bow with open palms crystallizes a stance with visible cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “pocketed sparrow” image crystallizes her tenderness and risk. Motive to protect vulnerable voices drives every beat, yet the final renunciation—handing the call over—costs her the heroic role she coveted. The contradiction between curiosity and humility is dramatized, not stated. One slip: the man’s sudden exposition feels slightly serviced rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“panic hummed,” “lips to air seam”); the contradictory drive—fear vs compulsion—propels every beat. The final renunciation of the gold fleck is earned by prior guilt and tactile ritual. Minor slip: the intern-era backstory is slightly front-loaded, though it later pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—“I count my heartbeats constantly” grounds the POV in bodily urgency. The porcelain shard, digital ghost, and mentor’s voice all exert pressure that forces micro-choices (recalibrate, defragment, pocket shard). Final renunciation of the ghost’s guidance carries visible cost: “only my breath, my pulse, my choosing remain.” Minor slip: mentor’s late arrival feels slightly expository rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storyteller’s interiority is vivid—copper-veined, quietly articulate, nameless after sacrifice—yet the renunciation of the travel-name feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is legible but not fully embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose”), but the final acceptance of keeper role feels slightly under-motivated; no prior contradiction is dramatized in-scene to make the “yes” cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The violinist’s interiority pulses through embodied choices—bow pressure, pocketed husk, heart-tapped code—creating a credible arc from cautious stealth to open risk. Motive intensifies visibly: “I played softer… strong enough to press a heartbeat’s shape.” The final renunciation of escape for listening lands with felt cost. Minor: statues’ interiority is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my arm hairs rise as if saluting thunder”), but the final choice to stay and then deliver the letter feels slightly under-motivated—more thematic than personal. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion) are present but not pressed to a painful cost on the page. Still, the voice is singular and the micro-choices (thumbprint signature, sealing the lid) read as character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carpenter’s interiority is embodied in tactile micro-choices—pressing the halo to the horse, timing breath with bells—yet his contradictory impulse (silent by trade, compelled to sing) is dramatized only once. Motivation is consistent but the cost of breaking silence feels under-weighted; the final vow to “tend the reservoirs of quiet” is more stated than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“I tie…twice for luck”), but choices remain observational; no decisive micro-choice alters the outcome. The scarf’s maternal backstory tilts present stance, yet the final renunciation (“I file my card under Promise, Noted”) feels lightly earned rather than compelled by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—e.g., “I bled a dawn of diluted oranges into the frames”—but the dream remains more symbol than agent, so the final renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the mother-memory knot tightens through tactile recall. The final renunciation—singing the loss into a beginning—carries visible cost in the ribbon’s unbinding. Minor slip: the locksmith’s interiority is asserted rather than dramatized, but the POV’s arc is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s guilt over loving work more than the rope-holding woman is a sharp, earned flaw that drives the climactic confession. Micro-choices—chalking cracks, angling mirrors, biting the apple—reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final “almost honestly new” registers credible, partial repair rather than tidy redemption. Missing 9.0 only because the grandmother remains off-stage; relationship pressure is second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—walking backwards under pressure, annotating silence with “combative tenderness”—but the child’s agency is mostly off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. Motivation (mentoring resilience quietly) is consistent and drives the final stance, yet the cost feels more communal than personal, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miren’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the seed’s hunger for testimony and her tactile pruning choices reveal contradictory impulses. Yet the child’s arrival feels slightly engineered, diluting the crucible pressure between them.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the restorer’s tactile micro-choices with the needle reveal a hierarchy of values. The caretaker’s single line of dialogue and winter-remembering grip add relational pressure. The final renunciation—grounding rather than banishing—earns its cost through prior embodied labor with the net and masks.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The framer’s “methodically curious” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching the tear, comparing reels, tracing the seam—each with visible cost (the map’s wound, the village’s risk). Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The final act of framing the torn map crystallizes a renunciation: the known is forever joined to the unknown, cost paid in the visible scar.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“Death and I were on a first-name basis”), but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational; the final act of taking the snow globe is under-motivated relative to the stated goal of “understanding the physics of letting go.”

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The balladeer's interiority is embodied in tactile choices—bolting the plate, tracing chalk, listening to valves—each micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values: song as conduit, not performance. Contradictory impulses (fear of silence vs. duty to the ghost) act simultaneously in scene, and the final renunciation of louder song for quiet translation carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The servant’s interiority is concrete and embodied; contradictory impulses—duty vs tenderness—play simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (humming to the elevator, arranging letters) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—leaving the diary open—earns its poignancy through prior causality. Only a slight excess of lyrical self-diagnosis keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—"empty spaces remember" drives every micro-choice; the brass telescope and spare line act as tactile extensions of motive. The final re-attachment is a credible renunciation of drift, paid for by the logged blank lines. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present tactics. Only the father corridor drifts toward summary, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The face-blind portraitist is sketched with interior contradiction and embodied emotion. His cued choices—rubbing the coin, testing pigment limits—turn key beats. The affliction shifts into active filter, shaping tactics under pressure rather than backstory ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“compass dust on my cheek,” “ribs were lantern slats”), but the apprentice’s decisive turn—solving the hopscotch code—leans on childhood memory rather than a contradiction currently in play, softening the cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the locksmith’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final “trade of attentions” feels more stated than dramatized, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Collective “we” POV is consistent; micro-choices (sharing water, knotting ropes) show communal values under pressure. Interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; no single embodied emotion anchors the final drift. The shift from fear to collective trust is credible but diffused across the chorus, muting individual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“bruised awe lived under my ribs”), but the adjuster’s final choice to sing rather than mechanically repair is more asserted than dramatized; the puppet’s counsel is charming yet external, softening the sense of internal contradiction driving the act.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker’s grief-rooted obligation and embodied salt-spray endurance ring true; every micro-choice (walking without touching, coaxing doorways) is tethered to the orchard’s thorned halo. The mother and boy exist mainly as catalysts, so relationship crucible is thin, yet the caretaker’s interior contradiction—yearning to leave while tightening roots—drives the final renunciation with visible cost: “the orchard loosened its hold, just a little.”

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chemist’s guilt and scientific ear are inseparable. The chrysalis test (“it answered by not cracking”) crystallizes a micro-choice that foreshadows the polymer design. Motivation (translate separation into connection) is dramatized through river observation and final sketch. Only slight over-articulation of “I realized” keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the apple trembled as though listening for an edit”), but the vendor’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; the final choice to accept the comma-seed is credible yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"taste of stored remorse filled my gums with rust." Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. transform) act simultaneously in the kitchen beat. Micro-choice to let the filament lick the palm reconfigures the keeper’s stance, cost visible in his taller but still haunted posture. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and spiral-minded; the “helix” motif threads through micro-choices (tilting the mirror, calibrating breath). The final renunciation—leaving with pathways instead of trophies—earns its cost through prior embodied struggle. Minor slip: the colleague’s reappearance is more vision than pressure, blurring relationship-as-crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s hunger for "impossible rooms" and the decision to endure iron crown pain root in visible motive; only slight drift into abstract interiority when the "blaze remains latent" prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sculptor’s interiority is embodied through tactile listening and micro-choices (“thread fibers… anchor it in the grooves”), but the arc is more accumulative than causally driven; the final renunciation of “cleverness” is felt yet not sharply foreshadowed by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the tutor’s exile, the girl’s silence, and their shared chess logic all drive micro-choices. The final surrender of the king is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor drift: the girl’s interiority is inferred rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the narrator’s pacifism is dramatized through the refusal to pry and the careful tuning ritual. The inherited promise tightens motive and culminates in a visible cost—signing both names—yet the arc is more accumulative than causally driven, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the olfactory lens is consistent and character-specific. Motivation (“cultivate serenity within motion”) drives every beat, and the final renunciation into stewardship is earned by the cost of inhaling grief. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the pilot’s contradictory awe and duty tighten under pressure. The arrow tip and resin spindle crystallize her inherited flaw—seeking inherited answers—into a visible cost: she must keep listening each inversion. Micro-choices (cinching harness, touching metal to resin) reveal hierarchy of values. Only the grandmother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is moot.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“the cloth oval a borrowed authority and a vow”), but the child’s arrival is too late to test status dynamics; the final renunciation of the patch is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell ringer’s synesthetic perception is embodied in every beat, guiding micro-choices (“tasted cedar, salt, mint, and bruised peach”); the sculptor’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters tactics. Interior contradiction surfaces when doubt about the city’s noise economy intrudes, but the final renunciation of that world is more asserted than dramatized, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is anchored in prior failure—the village breach—but interiority remains filtered through poetic diction that occasionally obfuscates concrete stakes. Embodied emotion (“the bones beneath,” “scar more than a uniform”) grounds guilt well; a late micro-choice to lower the tempo on the flute signals earned re-pacing. A felt cost—the lost market, the returning murmurs—justifies the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory; the narrator’s borrowed personalities and the halo fragment both act as concrete extensions of motive. The final confession—“I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself”—is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. The mentor-ghost device risks slight abstraction, but the embodied handling of type and ink keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Courier’s interiority is embodied and specific—jittery pulse, dragonfly pendant tremor—yet the final stance crystallizes without overt epiphany. Mentor’s absence is felt as a prickling neck rather than exposition. Micro-choice to ask the widow to breathe into his hands reveals hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: corridor thins, mentor remains absent, ridge offers only hush.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mystic’s interiority is precise and embodied (“boots planted in loam, heart listening but spine resolved”), and the micro-choice to name the car’s memories while risking Mara's scorn crystallizes his values. Mara's shift from skepticism to trembling breath is credible, but her interiority is slightly less textured. The final renunciation—accepting that objects only witness—earns its cost through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kio’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her barefoot heel tapping rhythm, the loom’s answer, the thinning of self in each fiber—yet the brother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation (send a wordless message) is clear and escalates to sacrifice, but the final smile feels slightly under-costed; the “debt paid in quiet” is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iven remains distinct and internally consistent; his meekness threads through every action (“rarely raised his voice”) yet converts into fierce refusal to yield. Embodied trade-offs—memories bartered for steadiness—show contradictory impulse in real time. The final image refracts that resolve into earned stasis. Minor drift: “quietly determined” flirts with label speak once, but the embodied bruised-wrist cost compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sensory map-maker’s interiority is sharply embodied—smell as cartography, pulse as waypoint. The contradiction between survivor’s guilt and reluctant agency is dramatized through her cyclic hesitations at the terminal scene. Her final acceptance, folding the child version into the chart, earns a credible renunciation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulses—yearning to protect the hush yet confessing “I am just the last person who said yes”—are dramatized through micro-choices like stacking stones and pressing sea glass. The final renunciation (five stones for love, one shell for the absent keeper) carries visible cost and forecloses escape. Secondary pressure from the skipper is present but light; his reticence limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s interior contradictions crystallize in concrete micro-choices (steering silence into beam-shape, sleeping on emerald glass). The arrival of the prophetic child re-weights the motive toward stewardship; the final renunciation—“we keep laughing”—lands with visible cost in lost sleep, inked ghosts on a child’s tongue, and the tower’s solitary crown. Interiority is particular, never diagnostic, but the lens of hybrid design keeps motive just on the safe side of abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the donor-heart memory is a strong micro-choice. Motivation is consistent, but the final “appointment” feels slightly abstract rather than a concrete renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the grief-work through dream-dust and ledger angles is character-specific. Motivation to “discover what trees witness” drives every micro-choice, culminating in the root-room excavation. The final renunciation—labeling the jar “minutes yet unread”—earns its cost from prior causality. One slip: the phrase “measured grief will float if you let it” drifts toward therapeutic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper’s fractured self and communal weaver role are consistently embodied; her decision to trust the mirror-twin scar sharing lands with visible cost as she “steps back” and relinquishes sole custodianship. Micro-choices (ask the pomegranates, invite quarreling neighbors, lay their names in sequence) expose both flaw and value hierarchy. Interior contradictions (burlap-mettle courage, loose-sewn self) act simultaneously in scene. Final renunciation feels earned in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is embodied—"absence is my coat and attention my lantern"—and the final refusal to return to old shapes is earned through the shared reading of Mistake and Wisdom. The friend’s on-page presence forces a crucible moment; micro-choice of reaching for the hand crystallizes the cost. Backstory is anchored to present micro-choices (selling the notebook, entering the corridor). Voice remains distinct, though a touch of therapeutic cadence in “stacked our motives on the table” nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical interiority gives the lone character texture, but the second character arrives so late that their relationship never becomes a crucible; motivations hold steady and renunciation is quietly earned at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“mittened hands,” “breath frost its rim”), but the mentor’s reappearance is more spectral echo than active pressure; the final vow feels earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a concrete bodily cost beyond symbolic light-sewing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lark’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“salt and rot and lullaby”); her contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. caution—play out in micro-choices (looping the fob, pausing the recorder). The father’s absence is anchored in present stimuli (watch fob, maps) and tilts her stance. Cost is felt when she pockets the “brittle inhale” and accepts the price of having broken trust.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skeptic’s interiority is vivid—taste as navigation, doubt as pulse—but the decisive shift from observer to “let it carry me” is compressed into a single sentence; the cost is felt yet not fully embodied in a micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The artist’s interior contradiction—gifted memory yet story-less portraits—drives every beat; the micro-choice to sketch the lock open converts grief into agency with visible cost (charcoal dust, cracked laughter). Embodied emotion in “charcoal veins” and “gray that won’t wipe off” grounds the arc. The final stance—publicly claiming Vera’s name—earns its cost through prior renunciation and shame. Minor: Vera remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent but not required.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is embodied, specific (“I wilt near dishonesty”), motives rooted in craft and empathy. Micro-choice—halting gilding, then refusing leaf-post—costs livelihood to protect integrity. Interior contradiction: duty to the city vs. refusal to abet lies, enacted in two clear beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iri’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her silence is not just trait but active choice that constrains tactics. The moment she “smudged the ledger with a small black star” crystallizes cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“circuits crackle with a low snow of memory”), but the android’s contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted in scene; the final choice to miniaturize the burn is credible yet feels slightly under-motivated by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The curator’s interiority is vivid—inventorying stories before objects, leading by following—but the interior contradiction between thrift-store pragmatism and healing ambition is asserted rather than dramatized; the final choice to unlock the mailbox is emotionally resonant yet causally light, making the cost feel more communal than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s embodied code-dance and the narrator’s micro-choices under pressure are vivid; the shared scar/promise motive is dramatized through each dice-roll hesitation. Interior contradiction surfaces when the narrator’s fear is “cataloged” yet still acted upon. The final breath-almost-laugh shows earned release with visible cost. No slips touch closure, but the relationship crucible is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the lantern-lighter’s contradictory impulses—grief for his sister vs duty to the pier—drive every micro-choice. The final act of sealing the memory into the tin is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is luminous and embodied (“eyes bright with inward constellations”), but the summoner’s contradictory impulses remain largely implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory wish to learn yet not interrogate is dramatized in the final rooftop choice. The neighbor’s dual identity is conveyed through gesture and subtext rather than exposition. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “agreed upon lies” that edges toward thesis-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “charmed skeptic” stance is embodied through embodied micro-choices—pressing shell to stone, naming self, accepting winter—yet interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical abstraction (“library of frost”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The final renunciation carries visible cost: the child disperses and the garden’s weather is silenced, sealing the protagonist as archive. Flawed doubt remains consistent, but a few stock phrases (“ghostly resolve,” “tragic radiance”) dilute specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the forger’s contradictory impulses—precision vs mercy—surface in the thorn-nib cut and the blank margin. The final renunciation (leaving the verdict unwritten) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present choices. Minor slip: “wisely enduring” is asserted more than dramatized in the mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s interiority is richly embodied—ribs as riverbed, shell as pulse—and the final vow to “tie kindness to clarity” is earned by the preceding braid of guilt and memory. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“so that is why some people echo”) that momentarily flattens the contradiction. Still, the contradiction between rope-cutter and knot-maker is dramatized in scene, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s vocation as ghost-whisperer is embodied through tactile choices—cutting portholes, braiding offerings, decoding taps—each action rooted in a consistent, self-imposed ethic of “weaving truth carefully.” Interiority is concrete (“felt the grid of Sofia’s rhythm in my palms”), and the final refusal to shout but instead invite the dreamers crystallizes a cost: silence chosen over spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the net-mender’s motive to “appreciate hidden effort” is dramatized through micro-choices (whistle, tea ritual, gifting whisk). The final renunciation—handing the whisk to the child—earns its cost by prior pattern of patience and tenderness. Minor slip: the councilor’s shift feels slightly expedient rather than fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The debunker’s interiority is precise and embodied—“I intuited design”—but the final refusal of the diamond feels slightly under-motivated; the love-note keeps the arc human and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The visionary’s interiority is vivid—tea brewed inside thunder’s throat, heart wired into circuits—but the arrival of Brin dilutes the lone-prophet focus; their joint agency blurs the cost of the final transformation. Motive is clear yet never tested against a hard choice; the “revolution” lands as communal triumph rather than personal scar.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The penny-poet’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“measured meals by syllables”), but the decisive shift from hoarding to gifting the sounds is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marek’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“ribs chimed faintly”), his contradictory impulses (logic vs. emotion) play out in real time, and the final renunciation—offering the key—carries visible cost. The seeker’s shift from hunger to unarmed listening is credible, though her backstory is compressed. No stock phrasing; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is sharp and embodied: “breath plumes like banners,” “eyes wider than comfort.” Vigilance is more posture than flaw; the arc leans toward disciplined endurance without contradiction, yet the cost (abandoning ropes for salt) feels slight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—empirical duty vs. inherited grief—braid through micro-choices (turning off the radios, keeping the lantern). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Chaplain’s interiority is concrete—his wince at the “thorn” mirroring Jonah’s jaw-clench shows embodied contradiction. Motivation intensifies from listener to active mediator; the final instruction to Jonah is earned by prior causality. Micro-choice—leaving the credit card, accepting the light-debt—reveals value hierarchy with cost. Only minor: secondary characters (Jonah) remain off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Ilex's contradictory yearning—irreverent yet worshipful—drives every beat. Motivation intensifies from quip to chalk X: no lying to the algorithm, no tidy ego. The shift from hunter's arrow to bell-switch manifests interior contradiction and final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist is vivid—embodied flashlight, cold archives, ethical strain—but internal friction stays largely thematic; the choice to surface Aida’s voice earns the arc yet feels narrated rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my coat smelling of brine and smoke and unslept prayers”), but the peacekeeper’s calm intuition is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to stay a season is earned yet feels slightly under-costed compared to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from scheduled vanishing to listening-as-renunciation is credible. The parasol tip and whistle act as concrete extensions of motive. Minor drift: “Doctor Last-Minute” feels slightly external, not fully internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lone sentinel’s interior contradiction—self-chosen withdrawal yet sustained openness to strangers—remains vivid and embodied; every gesture with letter, knife, and twine ties motive to micro-choice under pressure. The traveler’s fatigue is concrete, her dilemma specific, and her final revision of the map feels both personal and inevitable. Cost is visible when she kneels to carve new terms, accepting the scorched letter as scar-tissue within their future. Interiority stays character-particular without lapsing into therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s interiority is embodied and specific—“echo of wisdom settle against my ribs”—but the walker’s motivation remains largely atmospheric; his final gesture earns the widening yet lacks prior contradiction to make the cost personal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s calm is embodied in steady hands and borrowed rhythm, but the interior contradiction—tremble hidden beneath calm—never sharpens into a choice that costs her anything; she remains an elegant facilitator rather than a protagonist who risks or renounces. The townspeople’s micro-choices (laughing at the mirror, offering words) are vivid, yet the archivist’s own arc plateaus. Closure is communal, not personal, so the Earned Stasis lands on the town, not the lens we occupy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“hand nicked by paper,” “bruised permission”); the scholar’s contradictory impulses—reticence vs. the need to testify—are dramatized through micro-choices with the crystal. The final renunciation (carrying the crystal to the printers not to argue but to play it) is earned and forecloses the path of spoken testimony, with visible cost in his silence. Minor slip: the printers are off-stage, so status dynamics cannot fully register.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—salt counting him, chalk ticking like a metronome—but the final renunciation (“loved them for it”) is more stated than dramatized; the contradictory impulse to both remember and forget is present yet not fully crystallized in a single visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sage repairer’s tactile patience and stubborn listening are embodied in micro-choices—thumb on mirror, palm on capacitor—that reconfigure the telescope’s fate. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: certainty is a “luxury” yet he dares “to hope.” The final renunciation—unlearning the Moon’s silence—carries felt cost in the memory of the fleeting leaf. Voice remains singular and vocationally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The therapist’s micro-choices—choosing to call the son, unwrapping the clementine as a peace offering—show consistent interior stakes and a credible, earned shift from caretaker to act-or-den actor on the last night.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scholar’s quietly deliberate nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices—winding the key, arranging mirrors, tracing spoon-nodes—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction surfaces when the same caution that guides her rune-work must risk sealing the noon-contract beneath her skin. The final renunciation (refusing to speak the answer aloud) costs her the relief of closure and keeps the loop open, an Earned Stasis that feels proportionate to the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s forgiving skepticism is embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing the tooth, resetting Ari’s shoulder, choosing mercy over accusation. Interior contradiction is palpable: doubt and tenderness coexist in the same breath. The final renunciation of the witch-tale in favor of “ours” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (Ari’s shame, the town’s looming clamor). Only the slight over-articulation of “yearn without lying” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the protagonist’s renunciation of fire for tide-glass is earned through memory and tactile ritual. The final stance—offering gentle light without harm—carries visible cost in the brother’s absence and the village’s wariness. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Contradictory interior emotions simmer (anger / tenderness), embodied in “humming leaves”, pendant heat, soil scent. Micro-choice to proffer necklace shows hierarchical values in cost: public confession is acknowledged but the cost is burial not broadcast. Relationship pressure forces a stance crystallization: “We practice being two again” is earned stasis, not tidy pardon. The drive to graft meaning onto old wounds is consistent and visible in every soil pat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The novelist’s interiority is rich and embodied—e.g., “shell clicked like a whispered metronome”—but the refusal to “sand edges” is asserted rather than dramatized in a decisive beat; the final stance crystallizes without a visible cost that scales to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rowen’s interiority is lyric rather than embodied; his motives are archetypal (“restore sacred practices”) rather than conflicted. The narrator’s shift from observer to participant is credible but sketched in summary. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the cost is collective, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s interiority is embodied in frost on lashes, thumb fighting a twist, and the hush-boom count; the sister memory tilts his stance, and the final renunciation—saving the remaining starlight—carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses (wait vs. act) coexist in scene. Minor slip: “demonstrates patience physically” is slightly label-like, but the body shows it.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The locksmith’s interiority is textured and embodied—his “peripherally focused” trait is shown through concrete acts like chalking angles and installing prisms. Motivation (store wonder) is dramatized via the painstaking timer repair and whispered stories, culminating in the earned renunciation of leaving the timer behind. A small slip: the mentor backstory is summary rather than micro-choice, slightly diluting present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“saltshaken hand,” “knees softened”) and motives intensify under pressure; the final micro-choice—accepting fear as duty—earns its cost. Minor drift into lyrical abstraction keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—her thumb pressing the scuffed notch, the refusal to restore the name—yet the final renunciation (leaving the collar unfinished, the tin unopened) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. The widow’s contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. to release) act simultaneously in scene, not summary. No stock phrasing; every gesture is tethered to the ring of grief. Flaws (her silence, her compulsion to ritual) complicate the carving and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scavenger’s contradictory impulses (to salvage, to ransom, to rebuild) are dramatized in on-page choices: the penny tower dissolution triggers later stance reweighting and Earned Stasis. Micro-choice when he sets the camera wheel spinning to seal the truce shows embodied cost. Ghost’s four demanded verbs crystallize the stakes and compel the final agreement in-scene. Regret hoarded and spent against memory-fouled lagoon anchors everything in tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the intern’s “stubborn and simple” motive drives every micro-choice. The janitor’s brief appearance adds relational pressure that shifts the maze. Cost is felt in fatigue and the bench-sleep ending. Minor: the “functionally creative” label is repeated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the scribe’s contradictory impulses—flight from the city of bells vs. longing for it—play simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (barefoot step, cheek to glass) reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost. The final renunciation-to-companionship earns its weight through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s “serenely radical correction” stance is dramatized through micro-choices (hooking the box, packing the papers). The final renunciation—quiet collaboration with the engineer—earns its cost via prior family complicity. Minor: the aunt and father remain off-page, so relationship crucible is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the seed-collector’s patience is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (e.g., “easing its kinks without breaking the tale”). Yet the single on-page character never faces a contradictory impulse strong enough to threaten the mission; the arc is more accumulation than crucible, so the change feels incremental rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulse to “understand the geography of healing” while commodifying grief is dramatized through the act of writing the living obituary. The woman’s presence forces a micro-choice—tying the four names—that visibly alters both their stances. Cost is felt when the thread hums and the quince drop, sealing the change. Minor slip: the man’s interiority is ventriloquized without contradiction, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“his heart a metronome of quaking reverie”), but the prince’s shift from conquest to caretaking is more declared than dramatized; the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between inherited fire-skill and chosen compassion is dramatized in the coin-swing and grafting beats. Micro-choice to share the coin with the boy crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt when she gives away the red thread—an irreversible act of binding. Slight reserve: the boy’s interiority is only implied, not fully on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ilias’s motivic arc—“doubt as a way to listen”—beats steadily across disciplined micro-choices (door-stepping into ruby light, refusing the flood-tanker) that cost time and social capital. Interiority stays textured yet lands mid-section with a wan, diagnostic “realistically imaginative” label. Renunciation-of-synergy with the water-woman earns credible stillness, but his interior contradictoriness flattens slightly under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“I rub the gear before I sing the clicks”), but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational; the decisive act of handing the gear to the child is under-motivated on the page and arrives as gift rather than earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the carver’s meditative stance and grief-work are credibly strained by each micro-choice. The spectral mentorship sharpens rather than softens decisions, forcing pauses and depth-changes that carry cost. The father’s presence supplies relational pressure, but the arc remains single-POV and earns its quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory motives—obsessive precision vs ethical repair—are dramatized in bodily micro-choice: slowing the pendulum while naming each harm. Internal split between grief-tightened screws and patient re-shimming feels lived. Final act (offering the rake, joint launch) re-enacts absolution with earned cost; no safety hedging. Every tool in the tower embodies the self-debate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gardener’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “blithe mask soften into respect” lands as earned cost. Motivation (discover hidden intentions) is consistent and intensifies through tactile micro-choices. The final renunciation—planting poppies around the revealed absence—forecloses the path of silence with visible tenderness. One hairline slip: the phrase “tenderly organized” is repeated as label rather than dramatized action once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are consistently demonstrated (“hand trembles with responsibility,” “fear that hinges will be misused”). Micro-choice to choose a hinge over a wall crystallizes values at stake, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise—"measured devotion," "copying silence into parts"—and the promise to carry tempo forward is a credible renunciation with felt cost. The single POV holds; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“porcelain cracks in her eyes”), micro-choices (taking only singed envelopes, mixing ash) align with motive, and the final wrist-squeeze shows earned cost. Relationship pressure with mother is present but mostly off-stage, limiting crucible effect. No unmotivated knowledge leaps; flaws complicate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s “rationally rebellious” stance is embodied in every micro-choice—winding the cog, chalking the walls, refusing the slogans—while interiority stays concrete (“the old ache rose from my throat to my skull”). The final renunciation of easy lies carries visible social cost as the three factions leave dampened and chastened.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—her “stubborn practice” vs “effortless gift,” her shift from shouting slogans to listening—yet the students remain types (Rafi, Ola, Jin) rather than individuals under pressure. The final renunciation of perfection for “practice of hearing” is earned, but the cost is diffuse across the group rather than embodied in Mara alone.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tongue pricked as if tasting lightning”), but the final communal act feels slightly under-motivated; the chef’s personal cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The toll-keeper’s involuntary candor is embodied in every micro-choice—handing over the matchbox, revealing the tray—yet the interior contradiction between duty and wonder stays vivid. The final admission “I wanted the right listener” crystallizes motive with felt cost. Minor: Mara’s pressure is more functional than crucible, keeping the score just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and consistent—"creeping normality noticer" is embodied through tactile micro-choices (pressing orris, listening to spoons). Motive remains steady, but the arc is more witness than transformation; the final renunciation is gentle rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Oris’s interior contradiction—statue stillness vs. telepathic reach—drives every beat; the micro-choice to thread the ampoule crystallizes the “incisively kind” trait with visible cost (delay, doubt). Motivation to “welcome nuance” is embodied, not stated, and the final bow from the founder shows earned change. Minor slip: the scholar’s recoil is felt but not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “grim optimist” is credibly embodied through micro-choices—rolling the biased dice, chalking lemmas, refusing to step through the rupture—each exposing the tension between hope and sobriety. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak; regret is felt as texture, not diagnosis. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: perpetual ascent chosen to keep memory alive. Only the absence of a second on-page figure limits relationship crucible, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s insomnia and methodical hopefulness are embodied in tactile micro-choices (paint-stained fingers, dipping the brush). The final dot of gold is earned by her sustained, quiet labor and the neighbor’s return, crystallizing her arc without tidy resolution. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes. Cost is felt in sleeplessness and the perpetual anonymity of her gifts.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s fear of becoming “embalmer rather than nurse” crystallizes the moral tension. Micro-choices—baking initials, lifting the lens—carry visible stakes. The final acceptance of caretaker role is earned through prior causality and felt cost. Minor drift into summary near the end prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clock-maker’s gnarled, brass-scented regret and backward literacy are vivid; hunger-stone greed versus rescue choice crystallises late but lands.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiors ache with contradictions (photo-cursed admission, fear-as-editor) but the “I” stays mostly reactive; decisions are dictated by the advisor and the dream-dictionary. Motivation (“why I agreed to return”) is asserted rather than embodied in scene work, so the felt-cost of renunciation lands but feels slightly imposed rather than earned through on-page struggle.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure satisfies RR via Charged Poise—the funhouse “sealed behind us” image reweights the paradox so “unswerving attention” becomes the permanent solvent; on-page causal line (dictionary trick → paradox trap → camera flash) is clear under Accumulative/Textural lens.

    <comment>Funhouse corridor and rusted hinges are tactile obstacles, not backdrops; the metal clasp literally becomes a lock pick then escape key.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prophet’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tapping fruit, reading clouds, dubbing sea layers—yet the single on-page choice (striking the beam in D) feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is implied rather than dramatized. Zaya’s brief appearance adds relational texture but doesn’t force a crucible choice. Overall, a strong, idiosyncratic voice with minor motivational slack at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and consistent—"quietly driven" shows in every micro-choice; the copper tag and ledger anchor maternal absence with tactile specificity. The final step into the corridor crystallizes a credible, costly stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise—“emotionally rational” trait shows in micro-choices like copying names “exactly as the heat forgot them.” The final renunciation (truth over mercy) is earned, but the stationmaster’s trembling hand is reported rather than embodied, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“boots remembering former thresholds”), yet the surveyor’s choices—placing numbered notes, marking the waterline—are deliberate micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (“not to repair the past but to map its living gaps”) crystallizes a cost: acceptance of irretrievable loss. Minor slip: the paradox “stoically sensitive” is asserted more than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ossa’s calm perceptiveness is more narrated than dramatized until the blackout stakes freeze her template decisions; nonetheless her inheritance of method and her single-handed pursuit give the story its sole engine.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern maker’s grief is embodied in tactile craft and breath-counting; his renunciation of the shadow’s return is earned through the origami-crane ritual. Interiority is specific—"thin as a thread of smoke"—and the final laugh carries cost. Minor slip: the abbess’s dialogue drifts toward thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Wounded observer-physicist is vividly embodied through the shoulder crystal humming in storms; interiority feels lived (geode oracle, “intangibly tangible compass”). Agency stays interior—fine for this lens—but final choice (tilted observatory, vow to stay awake) costs are compressed rather than dramatized in-scene, so cap just under 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The pilot’s fluent, mechanically specific interiority (“calibrated for kindness”) and grounded micro-choices drive the ritual turn; contradictions between mercenary watchfulness and new emotional calibration surface in each beat, landing a visible reconfiguration at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—guilt vs. self-justification—drives every beat; the micro-choice to burn the archives is earned by the watch-hand reveal. Embodied emotion (“ledger aches with forgery”) grounds the POV. Minor slip: the final “almost believed” softens cost slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers worrying the drawer pull, pulse imagined in brass—yet the internal contradiction between recycling mistakes and the clinical detachment required for swaps is only asserted, not dramatized in a single beat. Raglen and Della are sketched through gesture and status, but their micro-choices remain extensions of the narrator’s stance rather than independent crucibles. The final nod and grain sacks show earned change, but the cost is collective, diffusing the personal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "broken navigator" interiority is sustained and embodied—his “jittery mouth” recognition in the brass compass, the compulsion to paddle edge-wise, the refusal to retreat from the boy. Flaws are active: avoidance (charts rejected), shame (friend’s death), and the micro-turn when his own brokenness becomes the very instrument he uses to fix another’s plight. The final choice to guide the stranded boat lands under Earned Stasis, the cost of lost anonymity felt in “let my heart and my actions share a shoreline.” Momentary therapy-like line “align heart and action” is the only nudge away from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—guilt over engineered indifference vs. desire to rekindle empathy—are embodied in the warming baseball and crystallize in the choice to stay and ferry others. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic, and the final renunciation carries visible cost (tied skiff, stained rings of ache). Minor drift: the caretaker’s dialogue edges toward exposition, slightly diluting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (reluctance vs. need) play out in real time. The final metamorphosis is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the loss of plain speech. Minor drift: “paradoxically steady” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cartomancer's interior contradictions—guilt vs. pursuit of time—are embodied in micro-choices like tracing the crack onto cards. The stakes escalate through her willingness to climb and repent, and her final renunciation (Earned Stasis) forecloses future time-loss with visible emotional cost. Only minor slip: one passage summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The caretaker’s pacifism is embodied in micro-choices (refusing to force the lock, calibrating buoyancy with grief) and culminates in the earned renunciation of conquest for stewardship; the interior contradiction between pacifist instinct and mission necessity is dramatized rather than summarized. Emotional embodiment is vivid, though a few phrases (“ghostly resolve,” “my odd body”) edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—her need to help versus her fear of vanity—are embodied in the act of freeing the fireflies; the final renunciation carries a visible cost (she loses her “lantern bouquet” and any claim to prophecy). Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“old prickle of embarrassment”). Secondary characters apply pressure, but their voices converge under stress, keeping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sentinel’s calm inventiveness and maternal inheritance anchor every micro-choice; the final stance—guarding consent—carries visible cost as he forfeits authority. Interiority is embodied (“the corridor tastes of iron and rain”), and contradictory impulses (loyalty vs revolution) act simultaneously. Only a slight drift toward lyrical self-explanation keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s vow and renunciation are embodied through tactile micro-choices (bracing the door, gathering the pouch); eel herder’s precognitive curse manifests as embodied ache, not label. Brother’s displacement and her sacrifice create credible cost. Minor: her interiority is slightly generalized in “resigned grace.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the poet’s contradictory impulses—fear vs. need to map scars—surface in micro-choices like hovering over the timer. The final tracing of the constellation against their own scar earns the renunciation of silence with visible cost. Minor slip: caretaker’s backstory is slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    The philosopher-mechanic’s interior contradictions bleed into embodied choices—using the needle card twice as decoy then as cartographer—so his final step into the gate costs him the safety of certainty; Rook’s surrender feels earned because it is shown as a stance crystallization rather than a concession.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Penny Poet shows contradictory impulses in scene—renouncing identity while clinging to rhyme—and the monthly molting becomes a deliberate, embodied choice with social cost (“ghost of copper on the fingers”).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the pianist’s longing and improvisatory nature drive every micro-choice. The broken clock and compasses act as concrete extensions of his inner conflict. Final renunciation of strict time is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fantasy reality checker’s interiority is lucid and purpose-specific; contradictions between skepticism and hope feel embodied. His micro-choices—planting the seed, kneeling, recording contours—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation is earned: he relinquishes the island’s dependency on him and accepts the tree’s autonomy, a felt cost scaled to the ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bonsai tutor’s interiority is embodied and specific—hands “learned only drift,” compass “clicked like a throbbing tooth.” Contradictory impulses (discipline vs. regret) act simultaneously; the final renunciation to “prune only what asked” is earned by the cove confrontation and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority excels via scientific lens ("preprocesses reality," dust-pattern analysis), but internal conflict between past "flamboyant fireworks" approach and current humility remains summarized, not embodied in micro-choices under pressure; Mara's flaw (bias for explosions) lacks visible struggle during sweeping.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses (fear vs purpose in pauses) manifest in concrete micro-choices like reading frost patterns; "pauses were doors" earns closure with visible cost of renouncing easy solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "keeper of brightness who mistook counting for giving," but the passerby lacks sufficient development to fully test relationship dynamics under pressure; micro-choices like dabbing the tear are character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in "exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps," embodying grief’s futility. Minor deduction for "damp astonishment" bordering on label-only feeling without deeper embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "chained liberator" paradox; micro-choices like sorting keys under enforcer threat reveal hierarchy of values. Flaws lack safety-hedging—chain's weight as vow cost is viscerally earned. Slight deficit in secondary character depth limits to 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: protagonist seeks fracture yet learns to "imprint trust," crystallized when sealing the bowl. Micro-choices like testing on the diver reveal hierarchy of values. Only slight over-reliance on metaphor ("mitosis of faith") risks abstracting emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction shines in the thief's duality (stealing to return) but "luminous disbelief" risks abstraction; embodied emotion falters slightly in mentor's reunion where "lake's worth of unspent horizon" leans toward poetic convenience over visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses (caution vs creation) act simultaneously in pivotal moments; final renunciation of fear earned by tactile micro-choices like sealing the bookmark to glass. No diagnostic labels during high-stakes glassblowing despite physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction ("fear could be a lever, not a lock") and embodied emotion ("palms clear with fear-sweat") drive credible endurance; final renunciation of isolation earned by decryption struggle with visible cost in "breath broke with the sentence, then reknit".

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority avoids diagnostic labels ("filament of cold trailed my sensors"); motivation to "find where thoughts come from" drives every loop with embodied contradiction ("broom does not complain" vs. lifting bow). Final endurance earns cost through "tomorrow will be another yesterday."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("coward, learning to be freed by honesty") manifests in micro-choices like pocketing then returning the lens; embodied emotion in "shiver" when hints "ache" avoids diagnostic labels. Final confession earns endurance with visible cost in "held it too long," though curator/troupe reconciliation slightly overshoots single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in mended deception scene: "why I had lied, and why I had not lied entirely" embodies embodied moral ambiguity without therapy-speak. Micro-choices like soil offering reveal hierarchy of values, though secondary pressure absence caps depth.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jae's motivation to prove sideways time is embodied through micro-choices like pulling the lever despite surge warnings, with "felt forgiven" showing earned complexity; minor deduction for limited interior contradiction during crisis beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Embodied emotion excels ("cold nibbling my shins"), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; ghost-driven action overshadows protagonist's autonomous choice. Micro-choices under pressure (turning pages "as pond lilies") reveal character, yet the final conducting decision feels externally compelled rather than earned through internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction embodied in "small stone star" and margin-walking; micro-choices like sleeve smudge reveal values. Oracle's "fault-tolerant" trait lacks depth in pivotal confession moment.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interior contradiction shines in "I swore at theories... but patterns did," with embodied emotion ("breath tasted of iron"). Final renunciation—forgiving the wheel but not people—earns cost through prior causality of valve turning and father's truth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority vivid ("grip reality loosely like wet paper") but lacks concrete contradiction under pressure; motivation clear yet passive witnessing avoids hard choices, missing visible cost in pivotal flood scene.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ada's grief embodied through locket-tapping and whisper; therapist's "softly adaptive" trait shown in shifting song to match her rhythm. Final micro-choice (whispering "wondering is love") earns quiet endurance. Slight underdevelopment in Ada's internal conflict beyond reactivity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction shines via "porous" embodiment and wind-through-gate metaphor, but lacks high-stakes choice escalation; final whisper to axis feels earned yet passive for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("accidentally prophetic" vs. desire to "transpose life") drives the final choice. Embodied emotion in "envelope sweating against my ribs" and micro-choices like pocketing the envelope establish authentic struggle without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details like "eyes a longitude no map would claim" and the "dry laugh" carrying contradictory forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in "chronologically homesick" tension and micro-choices like warming the shell to loosen "mute rooms," but closure lacks visible cost beyond exhaustion; the final copying act feels passive for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)

Micro-choices like breath control during timeline navigation reveal values, yet emotional progression lacks visceral specificity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority vividly embodied ("frost beneath the ribs"), but Oko's characterization remains archetypal despite functional partnership; Mara's micro-choices (threading filament) earn her thawing, yet secondary pressure lacks depth beyond cavern's role.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines in "credibly curious" motivation versus restraint, embodied through micro-choices like decoy charts. Flaw: antagonist lacks depth beyond functional pressure, limiting relationship crucible despite single-POV allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara's "cautious exuberance" manifests physically in thrumming/steadying beats, and her cargo-broker specificity (demurrage waivers, manifest-combing) grounds motivation. Jun lacks contradictory impulses—his "whimsically attentive" trait never backfires under pressure, limiting interiority depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    Contradictory impulses ("boldly sympathetic, a flaw and a craft") manifest in tangible micro-choices: reed sculptures marking whispers, leaning posture adoption. Final endurance ("not healed, not finished, but grafted") earns cost through prior causality—Farrin's chalk question initiating the search.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority excels in embodied observation ("hand resting on rail," "pulse grazed") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear yet static—no evolution beyond initial patience-driven quest, weakening final renunciation’s earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("not reunion, but coherence") and embodied emotion ("folding silence into scarves") shine, but sister's disappearance backstory slightly summarizes rather than actively constrains present choices despite strong micro-choices like fruit-spiral arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Narrator's "sympathetic skeptic" motivation drives micro-choices under pressure (e.g., offering tea after denying ghosts), but Lio's grief lacks contradictory impulses. Final endurance—"skeptic with mercy"—earned though internal conflict feels slightly summarized during the chair scene.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (boredom vs. discovery hunger) drive choices; embodied cost in "boredom had edges now" forecloses pure immortality. Lio's "face that had sworn not to forgive" avoids label-only emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrator's "mathematics of fair trade" motivation drives concrete choices, but Arman remains underdeveloped as passive prop; micro-choices like signing witness with vintage ink reveal hierarchy of values with felt cost.

    Interior contradiction shines: "incandescent restraint" vs. emotional need to soothe grief. Micro-choices like pressing pages against ice embody "texture is not touch alone."

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "purposefully curious" tension between scientific duty and childhood loss; micro-choices like vial timing show hierarchy of values. Label-only "purposefully curious" opening slightly undermines embodiment, but redeemed by concrete action within three lines.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction ("cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son") drives micro-choices like lattice placement, but motivation ("chasing hush") remains abstract despite embodied details like counting tide beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in translator’s micro-choices: palming coral while "test[ing] translations under breath" to keep them "honest and warm," embodying the tension between professional duty and emotional risk. Final choice to gift coral earns closure through prior causality—its grooves previously "hold[ing] pauses steady" during mediation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet doesn't intensify under pressure. The fresco fragment anchors emotion but doesn't drive pivotal choices like film restoration. No flaw-driven mistakes complicate the process.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)

    Interiority shows concrete contradiction (systematic work vs. faltering heartbeat) and embodied emotion ("taste salt and dust"), with motivation rooted in past failure.
