  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist's conflicted nature manifests through concrete choices—moving against the narrative current, gathering ephemeral hopes, binding them despite doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and drives concrete actions. Her embodied connection to the vine tendril ("copper-capped finger, feeling the subtle pulse") shows specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Corin's motivation to capture echoes is clear and consistent, but lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fractal weaver has clear motivation to heal the grotto's trapped sorrow, with embodied actions like kneeling and tracing patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to transform grief into utility is clear and embodied through the carving act, with concrete internal contradiction between containing and releasing loss. The final choice to place the lantern as a beacon shows earned transformation with visible cost. However, some interiority slides into abstract philosophizing ("grief is both here and gone, a paradox") rather than staying fully embodied, and emotional progression occasionally tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal conflict between eroded ambitions and resolve manifests through concrete actions (collecting story fragments, negotiating with her ghost), and her chronological confusion creates genuine disorientation. The ghost negotiation lands with earned emotional cost in tears and acceptance, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("eroded ambitions") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to resurrect the terminal is clear and her engineering mindset drives choices, but internal conflict remains abstract ("stoic wonder").

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to reconcile with his abandoned dream is clear, but interiority relies heavily on abstract states ("petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The seeker's motivation to "understand the architecture of lies" drives consistent action through the sundial manipulation and lock-opening, though internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The traveler's motivation to map "the geography of healing" through writing obituaries for the living is consistent and deepens through concrete actions. His micro-choices—kneeling in leaves, tracing marble, placing the thread beside the rose—reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (the ritual graft), and her internal conflict between inherited shame and compassionate purpose drives authentic choices. The transformation from firefighter-as-destroyer to firefighter-as-healer feels earned. However, the villagers' instant transformation from blame to gratitude lacks the messiness of real forgiveness, and some emotional beats resolve too cleanly ("the weight of her lineage lift").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to liberate memories is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "eyes glowing faintly with curiosity." The internal tension between skepticism and belief drives meaningful choices, particularly in the patient unraveling of the box.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentimentalist's motivation to "share light without using fire" drives consistent action, but her internal state remains abstract rather than embodied. The gear's mathematical patterns and generational weight provide coherent character grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliam's motivation as a gravestone carver seeking to map collective grief is clear and consistent. His "fiercely meditative" nature manifests through concrete actions like observing butterfly patterns and arranging stones.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ignorance cartographer concept is intriguing but remains largely conceptual rather than embodied through concrete contradictions or micro-choices. The character's motivation to "seed innovation within a constraint" drives the plot adequately, but internal conflict and emotional embodiment are minimal—he proceeds methodically without visible struggle or cost until the abstract realization at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" manifests through concrete action as she transcribes the pirate broadcast, though her internal conflict remains understated. The transformation from solitary copyist to bridge between silence and song earns its arc through accumulated detail rather than dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "crystallize a fleeting emotion" drives consistent action through powder-scattering ritual, though internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to preserve competing narratives is clear and drives concrete choices, particularly in the decision to document both stories in cipher.

The final renunciation of "agonizing over a single truth" carries visible cost as the character accepts complexity over certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The teacher character shows consistent motivation through her mission to heal through music, but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle during the transformation scene. The townspeople function more as a collective backdrop than individuals with distinct pressures. "Expectantly resigned" reads as a label rather than driving specific choices with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara's involuntary truthfulness creates consistent character texture and her motivation to preserve wonder drives the final beats effectively. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during peak moments—her confession to the drone feels declarative rather than wrestled with. The transformation from loss to renewal earns its cost through the hive failure's weight, though emotional progression could layer more complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is established but remains intellectually abstract rather than emotionally embodied. The choice to place the shard and observe its effects shows agency, yet internal conflict is told ("hoping the silence could be a tool rather than a trap") rather than felt through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization about sanctifying the town's rhythm provides closure but lacks the visceral cost that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The living statue's telepathic consciousness and purpose are established, but motivation remains abstract rather than embodied.

Internal conflict between welcoming nuance and maintaining certainty lacks concrete dramatization through competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aric's motivation is clear and consistent—his obsession with capturing missed chances through perpetual motion drives every choice. The character shows genuine internal contradiction between hope and grimness, and his final acceptance of the chipped die's "permanent flaw" as stabilizing rather than destructive demonstrates earned growth. However, some interiority relies on abstract philosophical statements ("boundless confinement was the catalyst for creation") rather than embodied perception, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's methodical hopefulness drives consistent action through painting and note-leaving, with Jiro's response validating her mission. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("mind forever wandering between waking and dreaming") rather than embodied, and the emotional cost of her insomnia and isolation isn't fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to rescue dying arts drives consistent action through bread-baking ritual and lens-focusing, with internal tension between hope and dread.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's singular drive to master the lighthouse mechanism is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like the hunger stone warming against his palm.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to save her brother drives initial action, but her internal conflict remains underdeveloped through label-heavy descriptions ("trembling hand," "deepest dread").

Character specificity drowns in ornamental description rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet's motivation to transform obstacles into instruments is consistently embodied through concrete actions with the mallet. His gift of interpreting clouds into melodies shows specific character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and builds from curiosity to mission, with concrete embodied choices (tracing shell patterns, following whistle resonance).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arlen's "emotionally rational" trait manifests through his scholarly approach to noble lies, but internal contradiction remains abstract rather than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation as an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is consistent and drives her actions, but internal conflict remains largely abstract ("stoically sensitive" reads as label rather than embodied contradiction).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara's methodical precision and scholarly dedication are consistently rendered through concrete actions (pressing stamps, cross-referencing charts), though her internal life remains somewhat thin. The final choice to present evidence to the council demonstrates agency, but the emotional stakes of her discovery lack visceral weight—she's more archival function than conflicted human.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lantern maker's grief motivation is clear and drives his actions, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation of grief into light carries emotional weight, yet the character reads more as a vessel for poetic imagery than a fully realized individual with blind spots and specific flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's grief-to-awakening arc is coherent and embodied through concrete actions (calibrating visor, stepping toward fissure, catching shard).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation centers on decoding the frequency but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The pilgrim remains a functional cipher without pressure-generating presence. The final "perpetually surprised joy" attempts character consistency but feels unearned without prior internal conflict establishing what's at stake personally.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's guilt and internal conflict are established but rely heavily on abstract declaration ("guilt-ridden," "conscience I try desperately to quiet") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final choice to embrace honesty feels unearned—we never see the character struggle between conflicting impulses in real-time, only retrospective summary. The transformation from selling lies to seeking truth lacks the intermediate steps and visible cost that would make it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The negotiator's motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" drives believable choices, and his past failure creates genuine stakes. However, the opposing negotiator remains a cipher with no distinct voice or motivation beyond "scarred veteran," and emotional states feel declared rather than embodied ("furrowed hush of his own heart soften").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The navigator's internal journey from betrayal to renewal shows consistent motivation, but relies heavily on abstract emotional labeling ("merrily melancholic," "flickering faith") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to "kindle empathy where none remains" drives consistent choices through the labyrinth, though internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation to reconnect with Arion is clear and consistent, but the transformation lacks embodied emotional complexity during the crucial metamorphosis—she feels "reluctant" yet remains "paradoxically steady" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to accept the bark patterns happens without visible internal struggle or cost beyond surface description.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation remains abstract throughout—she accepts the paradoxical task but her personal stakes never crystallize.

Internal conflict exists conceptually but lacks embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Nara's pacifist conviction drives her methodical stitching work, and her emotional states (joy creating weightlessness) provide embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's core motivation—exhausted philanthropist seeking renewal through understanding transformation—is clear and consistent. However, her internal experience relies heavily on abstract contemplation ("deeper curiosity pulsed beneath the joke") rather than embodied contradiction, and the fisherman exists only as a prop for thematic dialogue without applying pressure or forcing meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his "calmly inventive" trait manifests through concrete actions like decoding the sundial and placing mirrors. However, interiority remains generic ("quiet intrigue," "curiosity") without embodied contradiction or specific internal conflict during key moments. The final transformation of the garrison happens too smoothly without visible individual cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    Selene's precognitive curse creates genuine internal conflict between seeing doomed futures and pursuing sacred patterns, with her final transformation from prison to compass earning legitimate change.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation emerges through accumulating ritual gestures, though interiority remains abstract ("furiously tranquil" stays conceptual). The final stance of reverent traversal is earned through the vigil's pattern, but internal contradiction lacks embodied specificity during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mechanical arm philosopher and diplomat exist more as conceptual vessels than embodied characters. Their "diplomatically fierce" resolve and philosophical stances remain abstract labels without concrete embodiment or internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lira's personality-molting trait appears multiple times but never constrains a specific choice or generates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pianist's motivation to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" drives consistent action, but interiority remains abstract ("steely longing," "wistful") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like translating dream symbols into empirical anchors.

    Mara’s characterization is strong with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, particularly her shift from cosmic to microscopic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elya's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her glass-artist expertise filtering her perception ("delicate veins of ice that melted at sunrise").

    Mara's characterization is profoundly embodied through calloused hands, silk scarf, and pulse memory. Her motivation to "rectify the silence" drives the entire narrative, culminating in an earned Charged Poise where her endurance transforms trauma into art.

    Marlow's motivation is clear and rooted in his vocation, compelling his high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique perception of time, compelling her higher-stakes design choices. Her internal conflict is shown through her retrocognitive entrapment, though this trait could be more actively constraining within the scene. The final moment of tactile understanding feels earned, with visible cost in the dissolution of the photographs. A slight deduction for the retrocognitive trait feeling more like a label than a constant, embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a profound desire to prevent famine. Her patient, strategic nature is embodied in her actions, particularly the decoding of the piano bench.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices under pressure, such as translating color into tone and placing the device among the roots.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies from thief to preserver, with a meaningful change earned by her on-page interactions. Her internal shift from "steal" to "preserve" is dramatized, though her "quietly savvy" trait is more told than shown under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in her poetic and analytical nature, and compels her choices. Her internal state is well-embodied, particularly in the final beat where her purpose "settled like a warm breath on a cold pane."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's characterization is strong, with clear interior contradiction ("trembling certainty") and embodied emotion. Her motivation to transform vulnerability into power is dramatized through specific choices, like stepping onto the lever. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("the betrayal of my own mind was more transformative than any plot twist") which feels slightly articulated for a crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oracle's obsession is a clear, consistent motivator that compels his high-stakes action. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in his perception of the "ambered hush" and "geometry of silence." A meaningful change—the map's dissolution—is earned by his dramatized process. The only minor weakness is a lack of a sharply visible cost for his renunciation, though the conceptual cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The robot's motivation is clear and intensifies from a procedural directive to a profound metaphysical inquiry. Its actions, like projecting memory onto the violin, reveal character under pressure. The final choice to return to cleaning is an Earned Stasis, a renunciation foreclosing a path with a visible cost—the loss of the violin—scaled perfectly to the story's length. A slight deduction for a moment of abstract phrasing ("mundane mysticism") in a peak beat, which leans toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's characterization is strong, with her professional identity and observational nature grounding the piece. Her micro-choices (using the lens, listening) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on illumination over judgment. The final stance of peace and purpose feels earned. However, a deeper internal contradiction or a more visible moment of struggle before her final choice would elevate the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vine dresser's characterization is deeply integrated with the story's core paradox; his "wisely pragmatic" nature is embodied in the patient, ritualistic polishing, and his final choice to place the marble is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict—the "blooming withering" duality—is shown, not told, through his actions and the garden's response. The closure is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with the visible cost of accepting decay as part of growth.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to a decisive, high-stakes choice. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through mechanically warm hands and a luminous mind.

Her actions—tracing patterns, playing the violin—are concrete, character-particular micro-choices that reveal her values under pressure. The final choice to play the note is earned by the prior causality of her observation and the legend. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward poetic summary in her internal state, but her embodied emotion and credible endurance are strong.

    Mirela's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique nature as an oracle; her internal conflict between the weight of a swallowed truth and the search for clarity is concrete and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's characterization is vivid and specific, with his religious skepticism and explorer's curiosity driving his method of appraisal. His final choice to leave the wheel is a credible endurance that forecloses a path with a visible, felt cost ("the weight of that hidden confession lingered"). A slight deduction for a lack of overtly contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene; his internal state is more a unified, albeit complex, drowsy alertness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his purpose to witness without judgment. His embodied emotion ("the cracks of his mind where reality once clung too tightly") and micro-choice to use the origami swan reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her "cautious exuberance" is an embodied, contradictory emotion.

His sensitively perceptive trait is embodied through tactile interactions with objects (e.g., "feeling the page tremble under his fingertips"). A micro-choice to press the tapestry against the brick reveals his hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis of sitting in "bronze quiet" is a credible endurance, though the internal contradiction of his flaw is less dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, embodied emotion is strong (e.g., "surge of purpose"), and the final choice to encode lives is earned. However, interior contradiction acts more as alternating summary than simultaneous impulses in the scene, preventing a higher score.

    The priest's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a final choice that carries visible cost.

    Marin's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied flaw (emotional numbness). Her actions are consistent and culminate in a decisive, earned choice (rewinding the songs).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's meticulous nature and motivation to nurture integrity are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, particularly her lateral thinking with the message tube.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlen's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in sensory trauma, with micro-choices like checking scents against his coat and uncorking the vial revealing his hierarchy of values. His final renunciation—to catalog aromas of sorrow—is earned by the vial's revelation and his embodied grief. The emotional progression from personal loss to universal mourning feels credible and specific, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on summary in the final paragraph's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("to discover the texture of time"), intensifying to compel higher-stakes choices.

    The violinist's motivation to find beauty is dramatized through concrete choices like placing the bowl and playing her violin. Her "acoustically perceptive" trait is embodied, not labeled, filtering her experience of the world. The final choice to play and transform the hush is earned by prior causality.

    Mara's characterization is strong, with her professional identity ("tide’s negotiator") and personal trait ("whimsically attentive") compelling her initial choice to investigate. Her motivation to "uplift silent contributors" is dramatized through her action of creating the Compassion Register.

    Arlen's motivation to "graft herself onto community" is clear and drives the narrative. Her "boldly sympathetic" nature is shown through her perception of the orchard's sorrow, though this trait could be more embodied in a moment of micro-choice under pressure.

    The conjurer's motivation ("gently inventive... curiosity and compassion") is clear and embodied through tactile micro-choices.

Her final choice to become a conduit is earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in taking on the city's grief. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

    Marlowe's scientific curiosity and circuitous sincerity are consistent and embodied, compelling his choice to release control.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's internal conflict between her clairvoyance and her inability to foresee the cave's choice is a compelling contradiction, though it is more stated than dramatized. Her embodied emotion is strong ("feels the cool pulse," "gentle fire inside her"), and her micro-choice to step forward and whisper the promise is a credible action under pressure that earns the story's resolution. The final realization that the cave inhabits her destiny is an earned endurance, though the cost of this reconfiguration is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his exile and singular purpose. His reactively visionary trait is shown, not told, through his ability to sense a story's direction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)

    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a smile tug at her lips, for the melancholy of the setting matched the bright curiosity"). The final renunciation (Earned Stasis) is earned by her prior causality, accepting the myth's purpose is in retelling, not solving. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic-label feel in "the stubborn optimism of those who refuse to let wonder die," which abstracts the earned realization.

    Mira's dual allegiance and orderly intuitive mind are concrete, embodied traits that drive her choices under pressure.

Her internal state is rendered through specific, concrete perception ("paper still warm from the early sun"), and her final choice—whispering a pseudonym—is a credible micro-choice that crystallizes her values.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's interiority is concrete and embodied ("fierce tenderness," "unsent letters she kept inside her mind"). A credible endurance is earned as she allows the letters to speak, dissolving their weight.

Her internal contradiction ("shrewdly innocent gleam") is shown through action, and her final choice to place the coral's essence on the cast is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mina's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her search. Her final choice to place the ruby flake feels earned, though her internal conflict could be more contradictory in-scene rather than summarized. Her "wisely adventurous" trait is shown through decisive action, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper's paradoxical motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a consistent, somber trait. However, the internal contradiction—teaching darkness to breathe—remains more conceptual than dramatized through contradictory on-page impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a visible, felt cost tied to a specific micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in their past trauma, creating a compelling internal conflict. Their hesitation and eventual choice to trust the quantum promise feel earned, with the final decision demonstrating a meaningful change. The embodied emotion is strong, particularly in lines like "feeling the vessel's ancient tension echo through the farm's fungal veins." A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic self-awareness in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lian's motivation is clear and rooted in lineage, with micro-choices (placing his ear, lifting the floorboard) revealing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The knight's internal shift from withdrawn solitude to murmured allegiance is embodied through concrete micro-choices (tracing vapor shapes, whispering promises).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amelia’s “broken-hearted” state and motivation to “magnify small kindnesses” are embodied in concrete actions like tracing silhouettes and her micro-choice to present the button. Her internal contradiction—grief versus hope—is shown, not told, and her final choice to continue the work is earned by the preceding discovery. A minor deduction for the supervisor's swift, under-pressure agreement feeling slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's quiet resolve and resourcefulness are concrete and consistent, compelling her higher-stakes choice at the transmitter. Her final act of endurance is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of her solitary vigil at the water's edge. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on label-like descriptors ("underestimated") in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a taught backstory. However, the saxophonist's interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his resolve is singular and unwavering, which limits complexity under pressure. The final endurance is earned, but the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling her to higher-stakes actions. Her transformation is earned through on-page causality. However, the characterization lacks significant internal contradiction or a visible flaw that complicates choices, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "uncertainly certain" pull toward the compass establishing a coherent internal contradiction that drives the narrative. Her micro-choices under pressure—whispering to the compass, collecting the ember—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final earned harmony feels inevitable given her established struggle with broken rhythms, though a slight abstraction in "feeling a harmony" at the climax prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied backstory ("the weight of names had haunted her since childhood"). Her internal conflict between "luminous regret" and newfound purpose is dramatized, and her final micro-choice—whispering the dragon's name—is an earned stance crystallization. A slight deduction for a moment of near-diagnostic summary: "redemption was not a single transaction but a continuous negotiation" feels slightly articulated for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and a micro-choice (whispering the joke) that reveals her values. However, the trait "modestly fearless" is more told than shown through active trade-offs, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to endure the forest's penance. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, shown through the painful integration of trauma responses into a method of discovery. The final choice to remember rather than erase pain is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear, intensifying motivation. The final renunciation is earned, though the emotional calibration in the final paragraph ("I whisper a promise") feels slightly performative, trending toward declarative rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is exceptionally embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., whispering to spirits, following the sound) revealing a hierarchy of values.

The final choice to retrieve the ledger is motivated by her established trait of listening to ghosts, with visible cost in the ghosts' gathered gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alder's motivation is clear and rooted in his professional identity; his micro-choices under pressure (aligning gears, humming a lullaby) reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s characterization is concrete and particular, with her obsession and profession deeply integrated into her actions. Her final choice to step onto the water is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The "sensibly eccentric" trait is more a label than an active constraint, slightly limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's characterization is concrete and embodied; her actions ("steps through the gateway," "gathers shards of driftwood") are rooted in her traits as a sculptor and learner. The final choice to create a layered tableau is earned by her on-page realization from the lantern slide's projection. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on thematic summary in her final realization ("forever learning to turn splinters into bridges"), which edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is vividly rooted in a specific childhood memory and a restless need to "reckon," compelling her high-stakes choice to use the postcards. Her embodied emotion ("tears trace paths") and micro-choice to place the postcard against the glass reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies with a "searing reverie" that compels high-stakes choices. Her micro-choices, like arranging beach debris, reveal her values and competence under pressure. The final resolve to broadcast the truth is earned by the causal chain of her discoveries.

    Harel's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his higher-stakes choice to decode and preserve the prophecy. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like lifting and shaving the wax cylinder.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira's "furiously tranquil" state is a strong, embodied contradiction that drives her choices. Her motivation to "discover the texture of borrowed time" is dramatized through her actions and final realization, though the emotional peak edges toward abstract labeling.

    The tester's "credibly curious" nature is a consistent, concrete motive that drives the entire experiment. His actions under pressure—patiently waiting for the glue to dry, gently retiring the old rope—reveal a hierarchy of values favoring precision and stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The janitor's motivation is clear and rooted in a spiritually curious nature, with embodied emotion ("feeling their sorrow and triumph alike").

    The recluse's tranquil perception is embodied and drives his observation of the box and ghosts, culminating in a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" is concrete and embodied, driving her actions with credible urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her character, compelling high-stakes choices. Her "brazen calm" is embodied through systematic action under pressure, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Arin's academically rebellious nature is a consistent, embodied driver that compels his investigation and final offering. His micro-choices, like spreading the amber, reveal a hierarchy of values prioritizing inquiry over awe. The final stance crystallization—realizing homecoming is a dialogue—is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic language in the epiphany ("a shared reaction where each participant altered the other’s state").

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in ancestral duty, compelling his specific actions. His internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception (e.g., "listened as a priest reads liturgy").

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)

His embodied emotion ("his heart thumped") and micro-choices (nudging the wax) reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her past as a crisis actor and survivor. Her internal contradiction—feigning terror yet feeling it—is embodied in her "benevolently ruthless" resolve. The final choice to chronicle small gestures is earned by her established desire to "unbind the silent pact between memory and oblivion," with the weight of the scroll providing a felt cost. A slight deduction for the "nomadic penumbra" feeling more thematic than character-driven in its interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation to understand "the shape of home" is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific sense of displacement. Her actions align with this motive, particularly the nightly use of the stone and the final, decisive act of placing it back on the pedestal.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices (fidgeting with stones) revealing a hierarchy of values.

    Interiority is concrete and poetic, with a clear hierarchy of values shown through micro-choices like sealing the canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her emotional state is vividly embodied, particularly in the climax with "screaming tenderness" and tears. However, her internal contradiction is underdeveloped; she lacks a conflicting impulse that would deepen her characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The navigator's motivation is concrete and character-particular, rooted in mapping loss rather than generic grief.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's involuntary truthfulness is a compelling flaw that drives her choices under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of secrecy for communal good.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marlowe's eccentricity and motivation are vividly embodied, particularly in his method of reading the tide's gaps. His final choice to place the flower as a beacon is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, melancholic character trait. His internal shift from loneliness to purpose is earned through on-page causality, though some emotional states are summarized rather than fully embodied in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The queen's disenchantment and motivation are embodied and concrete, driving the narrative forward. Her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure are credible, particularly her vow and final interaction with the orb. The retinue, however, lacks individuation, functioning more as a collective shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pocket-sun alchemist's motivation is clear and his micro-choices under pressure reveal his values. However, the friends function as a collective chorus rather than distinct individuals, flattening the relational crucible. Their shared voice and lack of individual contradiction prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with the narrator's lucid dream chronicler occupation and "chronologically confused" mind filtering all perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena's characterization is embodied and specific, her anosmia grounding her unique perception of vibration and emotion. Her motivation to "unveil ordinary miracles" is dramatized through her reverent interaction with the clamp screw.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and deeply embodied, with scars as failed runes driving her transformative goal. Her internal conflict is rendered through concrete sensory details (e.g., "scars on her skin... a wound that whispered") and the final choice to release them feels earned by the ceremonial pressure. The micro-choice of placing the quill in the tea is a decisive action under stress that reveals her values. A slight deduction for the abstract phrase "transform scars into stories" which, while thematically central, borders on declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, flawed history. Embodied emotion is strong ("feeling the weight of that ash"), and the final choice to send the apology is a credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "unravel cosmic illusions" is clear and consistent, driving every action.

    Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a unique professional identity. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("quiet surge, like embers sparking under ash").

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific, contradictory traits (gambler's daughter, probability theorist). Her internal conflict is dramatized through micro-choices, like placing the coin, and the final choice to write the theorem feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a deliberate practice of isolation to "teach endings how to begin." Her micro-choices, such as recording Lena's grief onto the disc, reveal a hierarchy of values.

    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though her blindness could be more actively constraining in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s “confidently uncertain” paradox is embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene, particularly when using the dry pen that emits light. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation (editing without erasing) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A slight deduction for the "strange comfort" line bordering on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and profound, rooted in a specific, character-defining worldview. His "joyful sorrow" is an embodied, contradictory emotion that charges the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)

His interiority is concrete, and his micro-choices under pressure, such as the careful ritual with the coin and key, reveal his character.

A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic summary ("a sound of calculated spontaneity") in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian's core motivation is clear and consistent, but its interiority lacks contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure. It reads more as a serene archetype than a conflicted individual, though its purpose-driven actions are compelling. The final renunciation is earned, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's characterization is strong, with her gift for hearing unspoken words and her humble rebellion rooted in a consistent, quiet worldview. Her final action—cradling the grotto and whispering to the walls—is a credible, earned stasis that forecloses a noisier path. The magnetic grotto serves as a concrete embodiment of her internal contradiction: a quiet person who attracts and unites. A slight deduction for the "newborn rebellion" metaphor, which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's contradictory impulses—protecting the harbor versus breaking free—act simultaneously in scene, embodied in her "combative tenderness."

Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's morally ambiguous purpose is a consistent, compelling driver. Her internal contradiction—creating art for the forcibly cheerful—is dramatized through concrete action (whittling, narrating). The final choice to leave the artifacts is an earned endurance, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("emotional void") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The poet's aesthetic drive is clear and motivates his choices, particularly the act of paraphrasing the chant. His internal state is rendered through specific, embodied perception (e.g., "feeling a tremor of certainty ripple through his ribs").

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selene's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific trait of colorblindness, compelling her to barter for hues. Her "innocently cunning" nature is shown through her schemes with the plants.

However, the trait "innocently cunning" is more stated than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bell ringer's motivation is clear and rooted in a "powerfully gentle" curiosity, compelling their actions. However, interiority lacks contradiction; their emotional state is serene and unwavering, missing the internal conflict or struggle that would elevate the characterization under pressure. The final choice to continue is credible but feels more like a resolved stance than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied grief. Her micro-choices, like tracing the stencil onto the rose, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cartomancer's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her high-stakes quest to map hope from collapse. Her "steadily curious" trait is embodied in micro-choices like pulling the tape and kneeling to confide intentions.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The historian's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling high-stakes choices. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("atoms of nostalgia," "anguished joy") rather than concrete, character-particular embodiment, preventing a higher score. His "steadily unpredictable" nature is demonstrated through action, but the emotional experience is sometimes summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Dusk Noticer's motivation to preserve hope is clear and consistent, driving his choices. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure; his emotional state is more summarized than embodied in contradictory, irrational ways during the key discovery. His final choice to record a new video is earned, but the internal struggle leading to it is not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values.

    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the scar-reading motivation and the micro-choice to trace the coffee rings. The final earned understanding—that wounds hold hope—is a credible renunciation of pure closure, paid for by the ritual's cost. The telepathic link with plants is a flaw that complicates choices and drives the pivotal turn.

    The crystal gazer's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in a specific, impossible quest. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("felt the weight of unsent affection as though it were an echo of a heart that never learned to speak"). The final renunciation—whispering a goodbye and releasing the love—is earned by the prior causality of her search and carries a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to free trapped creativity. His actions are embodied and specific, particularly the tactile tracing of stars. However, interior contradiction is more thematic than dramatized; his struggle is against an abstract force rather than a concrete, simultaneous internal conflict. The final renunciation is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The guard's dreamless state and weary resolve are embodied and consistent, compelling his choice to act. His micro-choice to whisper the charm is a clear, motivated action under pressure. However, the internal contradiction between his dreamless nature and the sudden surge of longing feels more like an alternating summary than impulses acting simultaneously in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The philosopher's motivation to rediscover his internal wilderness is clear and earned through his actions with the gear. However, interiority occasionally slips into abstract, diagnostic language (e.g., "reclamation of internal wilderness") that feels slightly unearned mid-journey, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific loss (the dog's leash breaking), compelling her higher-stakes choice to board the ferry. Her interiority is concrete and particular, exemplified by feeling the ticket's stamp as a "pulse of hope." A credible, earned change is dramatized as she steps forward to trace the map, reclaiming her courage. The only minor deduction is for a slight over-reliance on lyrical summary in her final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The bellhop's silent vigil is a potent, character-specific endurance, but the guests' collective POV lacks individuated interiority and contradictory impulses under pressure, rendering their realization more thematic than character-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The titan's motivation is clear and regally unpretentious, but interiority is occasionally abstract ("felt a quiet pride that was both grand and modest"). A final micro-choice (tucking away the crown) shows character, though the emotional cost of the collapse is more told than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her past trauma, compelling her choices. However, her internal state is occasionally told ("her mind was periodically eternal") rather than fully embodied in the peak beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stargazer's "awkward confidence" is a compelling, embodied contradiction that drives her choices, particularly the whispered question to the stone. Her motivation to find meaning is dramatized through concrete action, and her final stance is earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for a minor lack of clarity on the initial catalyst for her action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Anara's motive to "evolve tradition with intent" is clear and consistent, driving her to the high-stakes choice of sacrificing her memories. Her internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception (e.g., sensing the amber's "latent pulse"). The final choice feels earned, though her emotional contradiction under peak stress could be slightly more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character's trauma is embodied through somatic markers and micro-choices (smoothing photo, noting breath) that feel authentic. The "quietly talented" trait lacks visible trade-offs, slightly reducing agency. Final renunciation feels earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, compelling his descent. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though the "rhetorical sigh" line edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. His final renunciation of his old self is earned by the causality of his actions with the cards. A minor deduction for a moment of near-therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's serene anger is a compelling, contradictory impulse that drives his every action. His purpose is clear and his micro-choice to release the ink is a decisive act under pressure. The final renunciation of his anger for purpose is earned by the preceding revelation. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of "vapor of memory" which edges toward diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in a brave conflict, embodied in the line "bravely conflicted yet resolute." However, the internal contradiction is stated more than dramatized through simultaneous impulses in-scene; her bravery feels declared.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's pacifism and perceptiveness are embodied through concrete actions (sheathing blame, offering a petal as a compass) that reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Her motivation to "weave continuity" is dramatized and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices that alter the community's state. The final renunciation of violence is earned by prior causality with a visible cost—the collective vow to protect. A minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "senselessly perceptive" label, though it is largely shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fisher's cool-headedness is a consistent trait that motivates his focused pursuit, and his yearning is effectively transliterated into action. However, the characterization lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would elevate it to the highest band; his internal state is more monolithic than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific worldview; her observant nature and use of logic are consistent traits that compel her choices. The final act of handing over the nib is a micro-choice that reveals her values, though the embodied cost of her responsibility feels slightly conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete guilt, compelling her high-stakes choice to interface with the haunted firmware. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied emotion ("dissonance inside her chest loosen").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora's motivation to discover meaning is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotion and a credible internal shift from unease to curiosity. However, her actions are more receptive than decisively proactive, slightly muting the agency required for the highest band. The final choice to channel the hush is earned, but the cost of her unlearning is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gentle radical's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the retrocognitive memory loops and the tactile tracing of the mosaic. His motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is dramatized through the pivotal act of renaming, which forecloses a path of simple nostalgia and incurs the cost of his past dissolving. The final choice feels earned by his prior, conflicted state.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ghost's yearning is palpable and embodied, driving the narrative. His synesthesia ("rusted brass and liquid violet") is a character-specific filter, not a label. However, the final choice to amplify the echoes feels more like a culmination of his established desire than a contradictory impulse tested under new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's affectionate skepticism is embodied through concrete micro-choices (testing the idea "not to prove magic but to understand") and contradictory impulses. Her emotional progression from doubt to "willowglass hope" is earned, with somatic markers pulsing beneath her skin providing specific, embodied interiority. The final choice to share her findings feels motivated by her established hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character's motivation is clear, profound, and intensifies; interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her whispered interaction with the storm and the fossil.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her actions are embodied and character-particular, though the "quietly inspired" trait functions more as a label than a visible constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority and motivation rooted in concrete guilt, with a clear micro-choice to drink the vial. The final choice to enter the pass feels earned, though the "prudently daring" trait is more told than shown in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen's internal contradiction between memory and release is embodied in his actions; his micro-choice to stitch invisible threads is a credible, character-particular expression of his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific, zen-minded character. Her actions are consistent and her final choice to offer the lantern's light is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's wistfully pragmatic nature is embodied in her careful, goal-directed actions with the vines. Her motivation to instill light is clear and drives the entire narrative, though her internal contradiction (protected vulnerability) is more stated than shown through simultaneous conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied worldview ("contemporary of the extinct sky-whale"). Her micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the sundial and recording resonances, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of isolation for independence is earned by prior causality. However, her emotional state is occasionally summarized rather than fully dramatized in peak beats, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her actions align with her role as a "keeper of secrets." Her final choice to guide the letters back to the world is an earned renunciation that forecloses a path, though the felt cost of this endurance is slightly abstract. Embodied emotion is strong, e.g., "feeling the thread tug at her heart."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's characterization is clear and her motivation to outwit the tricksters drives the plot. Her cautious hope is a consistent trait that informs her delicate interference.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    The claustrophobia and adventurous spirit are embodied and contradictory, driving micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of his fear is earned by the spatial mutiny's success, though the "prudently adventurous" paradox could be more active in shaping tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her unique sensory perception and a desire to reclaim lost identities. Her internal conflict—dormant empathy wrestling with her blindness—is embodied in her tactile, methodical process.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's "nervously confident" contradiction is embodied in micro-choices like her "trembling fingertips" tracing stanzas, and her final choice to protect the nail is earned by her established motivation to honor her ancestor. The cost of her resolve is felt as the "spongey dread settle[s] into resolve." A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her motivation as a "paradox she wore," which edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fiddler's motivation to "sculpt possibility" is clear and intensifies, compelling his ascent. His "luminous disbelief" is a concrete, character-particular interior state. However, the emotional embodiment occasionally trends toward abstraction (e.g., "felt like a photograph developing"), and a final diagnostic label ("knowing his quest had turned the impossible into a captured memory") slightly undermines the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen's "polished calm" is a consistent, embodied trait that motivates his key action of dissuading Maya and grounds his final realization. The backstory of his father is effectively used as a reflective anchor that tilts his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final renunciation of solitary burden is earned by prior causality, though some emotional states verge on diagnostic self-awareness ("felt the weight lift").

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the root-bound imagery. The final choice to step through the portal is earned by the tactile, scar-linking method, though the initial motivation ("purposefully curious") could be more sharply defined under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maelia's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desperate need to mend her soul. Her "dusky resolve" and "reckless idealism" are embodied through concrete actions like carving sigils and pressing soot into roots. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("recognizing the first thread of repair") in a peak beat, which briefly abstracts the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("confidently uncertain," insulating with facts while yearning). The final renunciation of craving applause is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closing image of quiet resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her scholarly nature, compelling her to seek a new purpose. Her kindly methodical trait is demonstrated through her patient actions with the seed and tablet.

His internal contradiction—being a fixed guardian of fluid identities—is dramatized in his realization that he too must migrate. The final choice to open a new shelf for visitors is earned by prior causality, with the cost of his own rigidity felt as his gears soften. Embodied emotion is strong, though a slight tendency toward abstract articulation ("accepting contradictions") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, her final choice to become a keeper of light is earned by the prior action of absorbing confessions. Embodied emotion is strong ("trembling fingers," "warmth seep into her palm"). However, her professional role as an inspector feels slightly ornamental, as her actions are more spiritual than occupational.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the tactile connection to the patched accordion and coat. The motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and drives the pilgrimage, though the "daringly methodical" trait could be more visibly constrained by a cost. The final acceptance feels earned through the on-page journey and confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's cautious exuberance is a consistent and embodied emotional anchor, with micro-choices like clutching the watch and documenting shifts revealing a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "kindly decisive" nature shown through pruning and storm management. Her internal conflict around forgiveness feels earned, and the final renunciation of seeking external contentment in favor of care is motivated by prior causality. The emotional progression from shattered heart to steadfast care is realistic and avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's "sincerely insincere" contradiction is a compelling anchor, and her internal tallying of the wind's whispers shows character under pressure. The final choice to "unhook" the decree is a credible renunciation that forecloses a path. However, the trait "sincerely insincere" is more declared than fully dramatized through a visible trade-off, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique condition, compelling her choices. Her internal conflict between waiting and her reversed aging is embodied in her actions, particularly the deliberate withholding of perception.

    Selric's motivation is clear and rooted in his quiet, unappreciated brilliance. His internal conflict is embodied in the act of unstrapping his spellbook, a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values.

A minor deduction for a moment of telling ("his underachieving reputation dissolved") which summarizes an internal shift that could be more fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, poetic yearning.

    Lira's motivation is clear, embodied, and drives the entire narrative. Her internal contradiction—the desire to name fears while grappling with her own forgotten love—is shown, not told, through specific actions like whispering names. The final choice to remember and speak her love's name is earned by the prior causality of naming the monsters, with the visible cost of her spirit's ascent. A hairline deduction for a single instance of near-diagnostic phrasing ("the weight of centuries of unfinished farewells").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mage's "earnest naivety" and "brittle devotion" are consistent, embodied traits that drive his actions. His micro-choices, like recording drips and warming metal, reveal his values.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Selene's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent, contradictory traits (scholarly precision vs. secret sentimentality). Her final choice to gather the shards is an active, earned micro-choice that reveals her values.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist's motivation ("to preserve trust under pressure") is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes choice to revise the harness.

    Kael's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his specific trauma. His internal conflict—the fusion of compassion and resolve—is dramatized in the climactic moment, and his final choice to awaken the Duplicate is earned by the prior causality of his emotional numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conductor's "mournful eagerness" is a potent, contradictory impulse that drives the entire narrative. His embodied emotion and specific micro-choices (the trembling pull cord, the whispered lullaby) reveal a clear, consistent motivation rooted in grief. The final choice to pull the cord again is earned by his established method of "tending to the unspoken," though the shift to full success feels slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with the setting, transforming from feral waiting to active curation. The final choice to wear the pendant is a credible endurance, earned by prior yearning.

    The alchemist's "stoically sensitive" nature is embodied through tactile reactions to the ember nexus and crozier, with micro-choices under pressure (adjusting tinctures at the penny drop) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. His final realization that creative destruction is "sculpting anew through measured ruin" is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his hopeless path with a visible cost—the transformation of his entire purpose. Minor deduction for "stoically sensitive" leaning toward label-speak in its introduction, though it is quickly dramatized.

    Mira's "balancedly curious" temperament is embodied in her actions, weighing wonder against caution as she navigates the alien lattice. Her motivation to navigate by starlight is the central, driving force that culminates in the test vessel's success.

His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("feeling the storm’s electric sigh").

    Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a profound, specific yearning. Her internal state is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion, particularly in the climactic beat where she recognizes the dream reborn in photons.

    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in reverence, compelling her high-stakes choice to play the lyre. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in feeling the "subtle pulse of the plant."

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemist's characterization is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("her hands, stained with luminous dust, trembled lightly") and a clear, consistent motivation that intensifies under pressure. Her final choice—the covenant to return each season—is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with visible cost, rooted in prior causality. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on thematic summary in the final beats, but interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Corin's reflective nature drives concrete choices (polishing quartz, angling plates) that reveal hierarchy of values. His final realization about the library-not-prison paradox is earned through dramatized struggle, with visible cost in time and focus. Embodied perception avoids diagnostic speech.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fractal weaver's purpose is clear and singular, driving the entire narrative. Her actions are consistent and embodied, particularly in the final alignment of the lamp.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific grief, compelling her to carve. Embodied emotion is strong ("hands cradling... a newborn memory"). A minor slip: "harvest lessons from loss" leans toward telling, but the final choice to place the lantern is earned by the process.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with eroded ambitions and chronological confusion shaping her micro-choices. Her final renunciation of regret is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and the ghost's transformation. The negotiation with her younger self is a credible, flawed struggle that avoids diagnostic language.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The intern's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a functionally creative mindset. Her micro-choices under pressure, like using the sextant to calibrate voltage, reveal her values and competence. The final, earned stasis of "stoic wonder" is a credible endurance foreclosing a path with a felt cost. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward diagnostic language, e.g., "functionally creative," though it is quickly embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    The introverted clock scribe's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (setting down tools, inscribing numerals) revealing his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict between the guild's standards and his sentimental dream is dramatized, not summarized, and his final choice to embrace the dream is earned by the scene's causality. A minor deduction for the repeated phrase "excruciatingly gentle," which edges toward label-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The seeker's motivation is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices under pressure (aligning the sundial) reveal his values. However, interior contradiction is more summarized than dramatized in-scene, and the final resolve lacks a visible, embodied cost on the page, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The seed collector's patient, listening-based characterization is consistent and embodied, particularly in the line "infinitely patient, a quality forged by years of listening to seeds sprout." His motivation to preserve ancient methods is clear and drives his on-page choices. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on told traits ("infinitely patient") rather than solely shown through immediate struggle, though this is largely mitigated by his active decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The traveler's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, evocative profession. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in moments like tracing the veined marble with his eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prince's internal contradiction (mechanical upbringing vs. yearning for organic beauty) is embodied and drives his every action. His final purpose shift is earned by the on-page struggle to assemble the cradle, with the cost of his old identity legible in the final image of his "ragged cloak turning into a banner."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's characterization is deeply integrated, with her lineage and profession informing her compassionate, determined actions. Her internal conflict is embodied in her graceful alertness and the tactile graft ritual, culminating in an earned Charged Poise closure where her resolve reconfigures her relationship to her past. The final image of her scarred hands tracing the thread is a potent, cost-bearing micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's luminous skepticism and patient defiance are embodied throughout, driving micro-choices like tracing symbols and whispering names. Her final realization that belief is forged from defiance is earned by the causal chain of her actions under pressure, with visible cost in the box's resistance and the city's exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The character's motivation to "share light without using fire" is clear and intensifies, compelling her final choice. Her internal state is concrete and embodied, particularly in the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliam's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, meditative nature. His internal conflict between the tangible (stone) and intangible (grief) is shown through concrete actions like retracing light and placing stones. The final choice to carve the basin is earned by his journey with Mara and the ribbons, though his "fiercely meditative" trait is more stated than dramatically tested under peak pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's ethically diligent nature and drive for incremental absolution are clear, consistent, and compel her high-stakes choice. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the moment she feels "the weight of centuries lift."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gardener's blithe nature is embodied through action ("humming a low lullaby," "smiled, blithe once more") and his motivation to discover intentions is clear and drives his choices. However, interiority occasionally leans toward abstract thematic statement ("intention was a shape") rather than concrete, contradictory emotion under pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ignorance cartographer’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to "seed innovation within a constraint." His internal realization at the end—that "true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know"—is an earned epiphany dramatized through his on-page struggle and success. His actions align with his traits, and his final humbling is a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a profound desire to "teach dust to tell stories." Her actions align with this motive, and her final choice to amplify the broadcast is a credible, earned renunciation of her solitary work to become a conduit. A minor deduction for the slightly telling "quiet pride" at the end, which abstracts her embodied emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's motivation ("to crystallize a fleeting emotion") is clear but abstract, lacking a concrete, embodied drive. Her actions are deliberate and ritualistic, but the internal contradiction and struggle under pressure are summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final endurance is credible, but the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear, consistent motivation that intensifies under pressure. The final choice to preserve both narratives is earned by the prior struggle. A minor deduction for a single instance of diagnostic self-awareness ("rationally rebellious, a paradox I cherish"), though it is quickly grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("expectantly resigned," "quiet thrill"). The final choice to invite participation is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for the trait "expectantly resigned" not fully constraining a micro-choice under pressure, remaining more descriptive than catalytic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and radical, rooted in her unique ability. Her micro-choices, like whispering to the vines and trusting the broth, reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's motivation to "preserve wonder in routine" is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to act on the riddle. Her involuntary truthfulness is a compelling flaw that constrains her choices and pays off in her confession to the drone.

Embodied emotion is strong, particularly in her trembling voice and the cool weight of the secret.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific worldview. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in lines like "the weight of silence settle like dust on their shoulders." The final realization—that their role is to catalyze shifts—is earned by the on-page experiment with the shard. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic feel in "inadvertently profound," though it is quickly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    The living statue's motivation ("to welcome nuance") is clear and consistent, demonstrated through its telepathic actions. However, the POV lacks internal contradiction or embodied micro-choices under pressure; its kindness is stated ("incisively kind") more than dramatized through struggle, limiting its depth. The final purpose feels earned but its internal conflict is summarized rather than shown acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aric's characterization is exceptional, with his grim optimism and obsession with the chipped die driving every choice. His internal conflict between mathematical certainty and poetic acceptance is embodied in his final realization, earning the shift from capturing to honoring missed chances.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (painting to rouse strangers). Her "methodically hopeful" trait is demonstrated, not told. However, the final beat of watching Jiro is observational; her internal reaction is summarized rather than shown through a concrete micro-choice under this new pressure, slightly limiting the character's full crystallization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear, rooted in her role and history, and intensifies to compel high-stakes choices. Her actions are consistent, and her final stance feels earned. However, secondary characters like the mute potter and the beekeeper remain largely abstract, serving more as symbolic figures than fully realized individuals who apply immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clockmaker's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific craft, driving the plot. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, making his determination feel somewhat one-note under pressure. His micro-choices with the yoyo and stone reveal values, but the emotional progression is straightforward without credible irrationality or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her to the final, costly choice. Her internal state is effectively conveyed through embodied emotion (e.g., "feeling the cold weight seep into her veins"). However, her final, pivotal word—'vanish'—lacks a clear, dramatized internal conflict or micro-choice, feeling more like a declared action than an earned, conflicted decision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Leeward tide prophet’s motivation is clear, profound, and consistently drives his actions. His internal state is rendered through embodied, concrete perception (e.g., "the wood now warm with the memory of each note"), and his final choice to move on is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward poetic summary over contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation of her original goal. Her internal contradiction (driven cartographer vs. receptive pattern-reader) acts in scene, and her final choice to carry the pattern forward is rooted in prior causality with visible cost ("sunwashed dread dissolve into a quiet resolve"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently strong.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen's "emotionally rational" trait is consistently embodied in his analytical yet empathetic processing of the letter and the station's decay. His final choice to declare the letter a beacon is a credible renunciation born of prior causality, though the climactic transformation feels slightly declared rather than fully dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's characterization is deeply integrated, with the core paradox of being "stoically sensitive" embodied in her hammering heart and calm mask. Her motivation to become an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is dramatized through specific, tactile choices like placing notes in cracks. The final vow feels earned by the preceding ritual, foreclosing a simpler path with the cost of ongoing, melancholic labor. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her purpose, which is immediately grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is exceptionally coherent and embodied. Her "tranquilly perceptive" nature is demonstrated through specific micro-choices, like noting the ink's hue change and scent of parchment, which root her professionalism in sensory detail. Her motivation to trace honest origins drives the plot and culminates in a credible, earned choice to present her findings to the council, foreclosing her isolation with a visible cost of taking on a public role. The final endurance of her logical stance feels inevitable based on her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, compelling high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("luminous torment"). However, the final choice is more a culmination of a process than a dramatic on-page decision under pressure, slightly muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Grief is a potent, embodied fuel, but the transition to exhilaration, while thematically sound, lacks the on-page micro-choices and internal contradiction to feel fully earned. The final choice is powerful, but the emotional progression feels more declarative than dramatized in its pivotal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her "sharp-eyed" trait is demonstrated through her piloting. Her "perpetually surprised" nature is shown but could be more active in constraining choices. The final choice feels earned, though her internal contradiction could be more pronounced in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's guilt is a consistent, embodied driver that compels the journey and culminates in a credible, earned renunciation. The final choice to seek honesty is motivated by the on-page confrontation with the carvings, and the cost of a lifetime of lies is felt. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("genealogy of guilt").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in past failure ("recycle mistakes into wisdom"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are effective. However, the trait "uncommonly thoughtful" is more told than shown through distinct, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied ("flickering faith," "gravitate toward the open blue"). The navigator's internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("buoyed by hope yet weighed down by a lingering sorrow"). The final renunciation of regret is earned by the on-page journey, with the cost of past betrayal clearly legible. A minor deduction for a moment of near-diagnostic self-awareness ("a mantra whispered to the wind") in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to kindle empathy where none remains") is clear and deeply integrated with their dirty past, compelling higher-stakes choices like tossing the baseball. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the phrase "jaded wonder" in the final paragraph edges toward a diagnostic label, slightly abstracting a complex emotional state. The final choice to embrace the labyrinth feels earned by the preceding journey and the cost of confronting past silhouettes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her "paradoxically steady" heart embodies a compelling interior contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, paradoxical task ("cloudbound repentance"). Her actions are consistent, and her final choice to unfasten her own grief is a credible, earned renunciation. However, her interiority is occasionally described with abstract, diagnostic language ("willingly perplexed") rather than fully embodied contradiction, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nara's pacifism is a consistent, driving trait that culminates in the final compassionate act. Her internal state is rendered with specific, embodied emotion, particularly the gravitational lightness tied to joy. The final choice to step through the dimension is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality, though the emotional contradiction in "resolve as cold as the void" slightly abstracts a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, particularly when she sets the jar down and invites the fisherman. The "destitute philanthropist" trait is less active than descriptive, but her motivation to understand transformation drives the central action. The final choice to walk away feels earned, though the cost of releasing the fireflies is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael's characterization is strong, with his "calmly inventive" precision embodied in his use of the quill and mirrors. His motivation to spark a "silent revolution" is clear and drives the plot. However, the final choice to activate the cradle feels slightly declarative rather than a peak of dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Selene's precognitive curse and motivation to understand sacred patterns are concretely embodied and drive her choices. Her internal conflict between fear and purpose is dramatized, and her final transformation from cursed to compass is earned by the on-page action of placing the stones. The final choice to trust the future she can shape is a credible renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("furiously tranquil"), and his final understanding is earned through the ritual's cost. Micro-choices, like setting the timer and whispering the poem, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is credible and rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is strong, with clear, embodied motives and a meaningful change from conflict to shared insight. The philosopher's mechanical arm and the diplomat's fierce resolve are integral to their actions and the final reconfiguration. However, the diplomat's internal contradiction is less dramatized than the philosopher's, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's characterization is rich and specific, with her personality molting trait actively shaping her choices and contributions to the rebellion. Her final micro-choice of welcoming newcomers with a penny is a perfect crystallization of her established identity. Rook provides effective secondary pressure, though his interiority is less defined than Lira's.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous in scene. The final renunciation is earned with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong, avoiding diagnostic labels.

    Mara's empirically whimsical mind is concretely embodied through her cataloguing of dreams as weather charts and her translation of symbols into factual anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor's motivation is clear and profound, though his internal state is more told than shown through embodied contradiction. His actions are consistent, and his final renunciation feels earned, but the lack of on-page micro-choices under pressure limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—pivoting from supernovas to subtle, testable changes—is clear and embodied in concrete actions (collecting the dust, running observations). Interiority is particular (“strip needless drama”) and coheres with her choices. Internal contradiction is present but mild; she laughs with relief, not triumph, signaling renunciation rather than contested desire. The cost—accepting smallness over spectacle—is felt but remains conceptually framed rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and steady—rebuild art and self after arson—embodied by tactile choices (following frost, arranging shards). Interiority is present but largely declarative; contradictory impulses are muted, so pressure reveals little ambivalence. The survival tremor and kiln‑side decisions ground emotion credibly. The final acceptance feels earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation to “rectify the silence” is specific and embodied (calloused hands, survivor’s body memory), and her micro‑choices (opening the case, activating the device, choosing to carry the song) align with that drive. The fear/longing polarity is nicely rendered via the device’s color map, giving contradiction on the page. The cost is primarily interior—vulnerability and re‑entering the storm’s memory—credible but soft. Absence of on‑page interpersonal pressure limits the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlow’s motive—guiding the dead to rest—drives tangible actions (reassembling the lens, placing the last shard), and his inadvertent stubbornness colors tactics. Interiority stays lyric but specific enough (“carrier of silence,” “weight of centuries”) to avoid stock abstraction. However, micro-choices under pressure are mostly aesthetic rather than contested, limiting felt contradiction and cost on the page. The final renunciation (vanishing) reads earned but not deeply argued in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive—feed the community under sanctions without alerting patrols—is clear and consistent, and her actions (organizing runs, ringing the bell, announcing results) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she carries “responsibility” but faces no on‑page contradictory impulse or compromised choice. Embodiment lands in a few tactile images (the bell’s tone, the lanterns), but micro‑choices under pressure are largely summarized. The endurance arc reads credible but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo’s motive—to find and free unused love—is clear, consistent, and embodied through his breath‑driven method. Interiority is sensorial and particular (iron‑tasting grief, breath syncing with wind). However, internal contradiction is minimal; the path feels too smooth, with little friction or cost testing his values. The change at the end reads as fulfillment more than a pressured choice with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mara’s motive—to design a maze that dissolves memory and moment—is clear and sustained, and her occupational lens grounds her perceptions. However, interior conflict is minimal; being “retrocognitively trapped” colors worldview but doesn’t force a hard trade-off on the page. Most turns occur around her rather than because of a pressured choice she makes. The felt cost to her is soft, mainly an awakening rather than a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied through tactile action (listening for clicks, handling the pod), but internal contradiction is minimal and success comes too smoothly. The “chained liberator” image is strong, yet we rarely see competing impulses under pressure. Micro‑choices exist, but few carry visible cost beyond caution. The final shift (chains rusted loose) lands, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—imprinting the sound of broken trust—is clear and carries through her specific acts (coral choice, recording the lullaby, nightly returns). Interiority is filtered lyrically through synesthesia, giving her a particular perceptual bias. However, contradictory impulses and on‑page cost are muted; she rarely faces a pressured trade‑off. The emotional register trends contemplative rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s goal and competence are clear, and her reverence at the lantern lands, but interior contradiction is thin—she transitions from thief to curator with little visible friction or cost. The conductor offers help rather than pressure, so relationship dynamics don’t test her. Embodied feelings (“pockets full of stolen golden-hour memories,” “pull of destiny”) are evocative but skew abstract. The renunciation reads earned by pattern but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive and vocation are vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (vial making, chanting, recording) align with a patient, deliberate temperament. The internal pivot—abandoning the illusion of quick safety—reads credible but lightly costed. Interiority is concrete through craft gestures, though contradictory impulses are muted. The emotional progression is steady rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—terror braided with professional bravado—drives concrete choices (decoding via stunt moves, stepping on the lever, accepting the vial’s price). Emotions are embodied through tactile setting and bodily awareness rather than labels. A few declarations (“promising that I would transform betrayal into a weapon”) skate toward told theme, but motivation remains consistent. The final renunciation/confession feels earned by earlier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is crystalline—he must map an endless night—and his actions align (lifting the booklet, “retelling” by compressing silence, sealing the map with breath). Interiority is textured but largely monolithic; contradictory impulses (doubt vs. devotion) are muted, so the emotional price reads conceptual more than felt. The Earned Stasis/charged acceptance at the end is credible, but the cost is mostly abstract. A more embodied struggle would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The robot’s curiosity module supplies a clear, particular motive and we see micro‑choices (aligning loops, projecting memory, then returning to sweeping). Interiority is concrete enough for a nonhuman POV, but internal contradiction is light; its “remarkable composure” blunts felt struggle. The change—redefining cleaning as synthesis—is credible and earned. The cost is conceptually present (losing a sliver of self, melting violin) but not deeply felt emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive—illuminating truth rather than judging—is coherent and consistently enacted through concrete choices (following the doodles, using the lens, staging the projection). Interiority is lyric but thin on contradictory impulses; she rarely wavers or pays an on‑page personal price. The closing renunciation (“not to judge but to illuminate”) reads as earned but low‑friction. Strong presence, modest internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear—he aims to earn the garden’s recognition—and his methodical choices (polishing, promising, placing a marble at the oak) align with a “wisely pragmatic” nature. The internal paradox (“blooming withering”) gives him texture, but pressure is gentle and largely unopposed. Interiority is embodied through tactile work and perception, not labels. The change is credible but low-cost: he accepts duality more than he sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Lira wants to prove time moves sideways—and her competence aligns with her choices. However, interior conflict is minimal; she experiences little doubt or contradiction, so pressure doesn’t reveal layered impulses. Embodied emotion is present (“mechanically warm” hands; heartbeat syncing) but tends toward lyric image rather than struggle. The result is credible but not yet transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive is clear and consistent—decoding the ghost’s secret—and her actions align (tracing patterns, choosing to play a sustained note). Interiority feels embodied through tactile attention to water, wood, and vellum rather than labels. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she meets little inner resistance beyond reverent awe, so the final stance costs her less than it could. The character changes via understanding rather than a tough trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirela’s goal is precise and particular—measuring the “swallowed truth”—and her choices (smudging the illustration, tweaking the barometer) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction under pressure is subtle and the emotional cost of the final stance reads a touch tidy. The renunciation—carrying the weight “outward rather than inward”—lands but could register more struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives (skeptical explorer seeking to “weigh” a swallowed truth) are clear and consistent, and the final renunciation (leaving the wheel) reads as an earned endurance with cost. The interiority is distinctive—treating psychic calls as “data points”—and shows an appealing contradiction between skepticism and openness to pattern. Embodiment is present (breath, ribs, chill), though the struggle stays largely conceptual rather than physically pressured. A slightly deeper friction at the decision point would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation (drawn to “regenerative silence”) and a credible renunciation at the end (reaffirming witness over change) give him a spine. The tactile micro‑choices—unfolding the swan, entering the refuge, writing one line—align with his role. Internal contradiction (yearning for renewal vs. vow to witness) is present but remains largely thematic rather than embodied in moment‑by‑moment duress. Emotional texture is evocative but sometimes abstract, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    Liora’s motives (to nurture wonder, guided by “cautious exuberance”) are clear and embodied in tactile choices—the locket against the pulse, the timing of the first chord. Internal tension is present but mild (awe vs. professional responsibility) and never forces a risky trade‑off. Her success arrives without visible struggle or a price that alters her later options. The final promise lands, but it feels cost‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motive and an embodied, particular sensibility (“feeling the weight of each stone”) ground him. Agency is steady—he matches fragments, tests the wall, descends, places the tapestry. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece values attentiveness over friction, so the emotional cost remains muted. Still, his micro-choices reveal a coherent hierarchy of values that suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear—he wants to encode human pulse and truth into fortunes—but interiority remains largely declarative rather than dramatized under pressure. Contradictory impulses (covert carrier vs. accidental prophecy) are noted but not embodied in a testing moment. Micro‑choices exist (aligning lenses, using oil flow) yet emotional cost is muted. The result is purposeful but low‑friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (illuminate hidden assumptions; steady the anchor), and a thin internal conflict surfaces (mission vs. risk of soul consumption). However, interiority remains mostly abstract and ceremonial, with little embodied stress or contradictory impulses on the page. The priest’s decisive tactics read, but emotional texture is generalized by rhetoric. Cost to him personally is gestured at more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lian’s desire “to become the conductor of those unseen melodies” is clear and her actions align (aligning the nautilus, sketching the score, issuing “Conduct”). Interiority is particular and embodied through tactile images (sand between toes, frost‑etched glass). However, internal contradiction is light; the “chronologically homesick” tension reframes rather than really pressurizes a choice. The change to “burden as compass” lands but carries modest, not visceral, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he aims to “conquer the labyrinth of self”—and micro-choices occur (stepping onto the viaduct, aligning with the algorithm, accepting fractured selves). However, interior conflict remains largely abstract; contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized. Embodied emotion is thin beyond awe and resolve. The final renunciation/acceptance reads earned but not paid with a concrete felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marin’s desire to thaw her numbness is concrete and embodied through touch and vibration, and her choices (reversing, then forcing the songs forward) align with that motive. Interiority is present and image‑driven, though contradictory impulses are muted—she rarely hesitates, so struggle reads more lyrical than pressured. The change at the end feels earned by the tactile engagement with silence. The personal cost is felt but soft, more thaw than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s meticulousness and integrity-driven curiosity motivate concrete choices (handling the tube, choosing the shaft) and a quiet vow that reorients her ongoing purpose. Internal contradiction is mild—tranquility paired with vigilance—but not deeply dramatized under pressure. The cat beat adds warmth rather than pressure. Still, actions align convincingly with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and particular—he seeks an answer to scent‑triggered tears—and his choices (uncorking the vial, staying with the grief, vowing to catalog aromas) align. Interiority is sensory and embodied (tears, stinging eyes), avoiding label‑speak. The internal contradiction—cautious around scent yet compelled to probe deeper—gives him texture. The closing renunciation/commitment is credible, though the ease of the epiphany risks slight tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is vivid and sustained (“to discover the texture of time”), and the final choice to bind the rope is earned by prior beats. Contradictory impulses—preserve memory vs. release it—are present, though they remain largely conceptual rather than bodily felt. The “ethically playful” stance drives micro‑choices (chess with the night), yet interiority leans lyric over concrete embodiment. The cost—sealing the echo of the escaped soul—is legible and character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear—she seeks to “find beauty in the unfinished”—and her choices (placing the bowl, playing, returning for a final refrain) align. Interiority is sensory‑anchored (vibration through earth, sound via waterlogged boards) but inner conflict is muted. The endurance/renunciation cost is conceptual rather than personal and thus modest. Still, action under pressure reveals a consistent, particular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives and methods are clear and character‑specific, and her “affectionate detachment” reads credibly through tactile choices (rubbing the petal, sealing the vial). However, she faces little counter‑pressure; contradictory impulses surface but never truly force a trade‑off on the page. The courier tease hints at future conflict rather than testing her stance now. Strong presence, modest on‑scene struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motives (profit with mercy, “cautious exuberance”) are clear and her choices propel the action, but internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than dramatized in scene. The lighthouse keeper registers as a gentle foil rather than real pressure. The Compassion Register choice shows a value hierarchy, yet it costs her little on the page. Emotional texture leans stated over embodied in pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Arlen’s goal—“to graft herself onto community”—is clear and her actions align (inviting the villagers, touching the glyph, vowing dedication). Interiority is lyric and sensorial but shows limited contradiction or cost under pressure. The “boldly sympathetic” trait is dramatized through her responsiveness to the orchard’s ache, yet she encounters little resistance. The late arrival of Lira offers a gentle uptick rather than a crucible that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear desire and a culminating sacrifice (releasing the pendant) give Mira definition, but her interiority leans generalized lyricism over contradictory impulses under pressure. The illustrator detail colors perception but rarely constrains choices beyond one sketching moment. The final renunciation reads earned, though her path feels relatively unopposed and emotionally steady. Strong, but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (to parse the “mathematics of emotion”) is clear and drives concrete choices—placing, aligning, recording, then incanting. Interiority is sensorially embodied but remains largely serene; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, making the epiphany feel slightly tidy. The character’s “gently inventive” trait is shown through method, not just label. Change lands as a reframing rather than a costed renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s motive (to make abandoned knowledge legible and “become visible”) is clear and consistently filtered through her kindly methodical temperament. Interiority is specific in sensory terms (rain on stone, metallic resonance) but shows little live contradiction or cost beyond a gentle risk of exposure. Her final step—emerging as a guide—reads earned, though the vulnerability price is only implied. A shade more friction or hesitation in her emergence would deepen character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marlowe’s motive—to study post‑storm plant behavior—drives his choices (the coil, the journal, the later greenhouse). His temperament (“circuitously sincere”) informs method rather than platitude, though internal contradiction is mild and largely untested. The emotional register is embodied through observation more than through struggle. The change—adopting a sustained practice of releasing control—reads credible but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s drive (“to thresh meaning from experience”) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: following the rain trail, accepting the exchange, placing the brooch. Interiority is textured and embodied (“boots slipping on algae,” “haggard awe”). Internal contradiction is modest—her sacrifice of the canvases is felt but not heavily contested on the page. Still, the cost registers credibly as a meaningful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira’s motive (seeking the pearl to magnify “everyday magic”) is clear, and she makes a few micro‑choices (stepping forward, whispering the promise, taking the amber tear). Internal contradiction (“a clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming”) is evocative but under‑dramatized in scene. The cave’s agency eclipses hers at key beats, muting felt cost. Emotional texture is lyrical but light on embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation and vocation are clear and particular, and his micro‑choices (blowing the valve, pausing for echoes, inviting the town, then departing) align with his purpose. Internal contradiction is light—he “lets gaps breathe” but faces little on‑page cost or competing impulse. The exile frames him but doesn’t pressure a live dilemma in scene. Strong specificity, modest conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks the “fortress of unspoken truths”—and her micro-choices (following arrows, pressing the punch) align with that drive. Interiority is lyrical but thin on contradiction; “trembling certainty” smooths over fear, so cost feels modest. Embodied perception (mist, cold, vibrations) grounds her experience. The closing vow signals a credible renunciation of the ordinary, though the emotional price is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s contradiction—skepticism braided with wonder—reads specific and embodied (offering tea to the wind while rigorously noting the tile’s changes). Her goal is clear and her micro‑choices (placing the tile, committing to transcription, promising to keep the sanctuary) align with character. The emotional turn to “bridge” is earned by accumulated observation rather than announced epiphany. The cost is gentle (softening skepticism and accepting custodial responsibility), which slightly limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The immortal’s boredom-to-purpose arc is credible and motivated by curiosity, with micro-choices (not answering “Will you stay?”, pressing the amulet to the seam, stepping forward) revealing values under pressure. Interiority is specific to centuries of ennui rather than generic despair. The shift costs him his stasis and place, but the price remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt. A touch more contradiction at the peak beat would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motive—prove lineage and fairness to secure asylum—is clear and consistent, and her “honest child of a con artist” paradox gives her texture. The embodied waiting, sensing grief in her feet, shows a credible interior. However, conflict inside her remains relatively unpressured; the ink works once conditions align, so contradictory impulses seldom collide on the page. The shift from doubt to resolve feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he gathers “textures of different times” via meticulous observation—and his actions align. Interiority is sensorially embodied but largely unconflicted, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The final understanding (“invented histories were not lies but bridges”) reads earned but exacts minimal felt cost. Strong singular POV, but micro‑choices rarely escalate beyond ritual attention.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation (to surface erased histories) and a credible final stance (accepting the role of “unnamed keeper”). Interiority is specific and sensorial, but internal contradiction is light—fear or doubt under pressure is muted. Micro-choices exist (taking and using the label, following the glow), yet they rarely exact a visible cost beyond fatigue and isolation. The character’s namelessness informs perspective well, though it’s more theme than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Selene’s curiosity and myth‑busting ethos motivate clear actions (placing the shell, retelling the legend, choosing the ledger). Her interiority is distinct—gloom matched with bright curiosity—yet conflict between debunking and embracing wonder is lightly staged. The shift to accepting myth as living art reads earned but the cost (relinquishing strict certainty) is only implied. The mentor’s echo adds texture but no on‑page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s motives are clear and consistent, with a credible tension between carnival freedom and loyalty to dock workers. However, interiority is largely told rather than dramatized; we’re told her “dual allegiance tugged her heart” without embodied micro-choices under pressure. Her competence skews the piece toward smooth success, limiting felt cost. The phoenix decision nods at balance but doesn’t force a painful on‑page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear motive (archive the last grain) and embodied procedure give the inspector specificity; grief and duty braid credibly at the click. Internal contradiction is mild—he’s steady rather than torn—so the emotional cost lands quietly rather than combustively. Micro-choices (calibrating, waiting, packing) reflect character values under time pressure. A slightly declarative line (“a proof that purposefully curious eyes…”) edges toward telling.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—restore the wing and glean navigation insight—is clear and embodied through tactile, auditory cues; her competence feels lived-in. However, internal conflict is minimal; she encounters little true resistance or contradictory impulse beyond a gentle time pressure. The closing calm reads earned but low-cost. A sharper moment of doubt or trade-off would deepen character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive (“to find where the rivers begin”) is clear and her composed, dry wit under pressure reads consistently through concrete micro‑choices (the glass, the transmitter, the phrasebook). The contradictory calm/dread is specific to her and earns texture without melodrama. However, internal conflict remains subtle; she rarely faces a value trade‑off with visible cost. The final stance is credible but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    The tuner’s motive—restore “shared balance between stone and spirit”—is clear and enacted through patient, ritualized action. However, interiority is sparse and largely emblematic; we rarely feel contradictory impulses under pressure. His renunciation at the end (leaving as the town begins to live) registers as a quiet, credible cost. The hands‑on orchestration provides embodied emotion, but the character remains mythic more than psychologically particular.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s fear-versus-purpose conflict is clear, embodied by the HUD’s waning battery and the calming vial. The renunciation of the distress beacon reads as a motivated choice that costs her a safety net. However, the “true motivation” realization is told rather than dramatized, and contradictory impulses could be more sharply staged. Small continuity slips (vial placement) slightly blunt character clarity under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive (redemption via the hush and the bodies) and steady micro‑choices (ledge → corridor → chest → reef) carry the piece. Interiority is lyric and particular, though contradiction is light—the path feels preordained rather than wrestled for. The maternal lattice adds texture but doesn’t force morally costly trade‑offs. The final peace reads earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear—repaying a lifetimes‑long debt—and culminates in a costly choice (the self‑erasing sigh). Interiority is lyrical rather than granular, but contradictory impulses (“lovingly venomous”) register and guide action. Micro‑choices (placing the bead, whispering to vines, the final release) align with motive. Limited friction beyond renunciation keeps complexity just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she aims to stitch hope into a ruined labyrinth—but internal contradiction and on‑page struggle are minimal. The “courage to break the old laws” is asserted rather than dramatized, so cost reads soft. Interiority is lyric and sensorial but rarely pressured by real resistance. The final endurance feels earned texturally, not psychologically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s desire to restore the altar is clear and consistent, and her “warmly curious” stance colors her perception. However, there’s little internal contradiction or on‑page struggle; she rarely meets resistance that forces a value trade. Micro‑choices (placing, turning, aligning) show care but low pressure. The resolution feels earned but largely untested emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is explicit and coherent (“to discover meaning in the margins”), and actions align with it through the ritual. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost pushing Mara under pressure. Interiority remains generalized rather than character‑particular beyond vocation. The final choice reads as continuation of intention versus a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (listening for unheard stories to preempt a coup) drives consistent choices, and competence is shown through methodical, embodied craft. Contradictory impulses are hinted (wisdom masked as foolishness) but not dramatized under pressure on the page. Emotional texture stays serene rather than conflicted even as stakes rise. The decisive act—finishing and sending the chart—fits her values but carries limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent desire (to find the moment before deciding) and embodied ritual choices give her agency, but internal contradiction is muted; the conflict leans contemplative more than pressured. “Fierce tenderness” recurs and partially individualizes her, yet micro-choices under stress are limited. The surrender—letting the unsent letters speak—lands, though its felt cost is soft. Overall, credible interiority with modest ambiguity, not fully crucible‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The translator’s motive—to transmute trauma into meaning—drives tactile micro‑choices (placing the vial, tracing letters, whispering). The “shrewdly innocent” paradox reads character‑particular and avoids sainthood through the felt ache at the end. Pressure is gentle and largely internal, but it coheres. The visible cost is modest yet present in the lotus‑hearted ache.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—she aims to revive joy through luminous murals—but internal contradiction and cost are minimal. Interiority is present yet largely declarative (“the true power... was to illuminate hearts”) rather than pressure-tested. Micro-choices (placing the fragment, “sealing” the mural) are purposeful but never feel difficult. The emotional arc trends steady uplift with little friction to reveal deeper flaws or competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s motives are coherent (listening, trading certainty for curiosity), and her micro-choices (whispering, tapping, pocketing the coin) align with a methodically playful temperament. Interiority is sensorially grounded, though conflict is largely unopposed and risk stays conceptual. The “cost” of abandoning certainty is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the final renunciation feels earned by the pattern of attention and response.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysander’s motive—to guard his “spark of defiance”—is vivid and consistent, and his tactic (planting encoded seedlings) aligns with it. Interiority is more declarative than conflicted; we rarely see contradictory impulses in real time. Dr. Mirabel’s late protective decision adds relational pressure and a credible pivot. Emotional cost is implied rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—transmuting pain into beauty—and his shyly unstoppable temperament is dramatized through centuries of persistence and the lullaby method. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (moon-painted veins, reef-shadow joy). The internal contradiction (trembling humility vs relentless yearning) reads in action, not just label. Costs are mostly historicized rather than contested on the page, keeping the micro-choices gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—she preserves “the sound of forgotten names”—and her micro‑choices (lighting, aligning, recording, offering the orchid) consistently embody that aim. The interiority is specific (“foxglove regret” dissolving into gratitude) though the conflict stays gentle rather than actively torn. The traveler’s brief arrival tests her role just enough to reveal values without a dramatic rupture. Change is credible as Earned Stasis: purpose over comfort with a felt, ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (restore trust) and trait tension (“carefully reckless”) are clear and embodied in her measured yet daring decoding. Interiority is specific (childlike exuberance tempered by duty), but her flaws or blind spots never force a painful trade-off. Micro-choices (which glyph to approach, whispering promises) track with her identity. The cost remains conceptual rather than personally taxing, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s goal and competence are clear, and her embodied relationship to tools and stone is specific and convincing. However, there’s little friction inside her—no contradictory impulses under pressure or visible cost to her choice—so the arc feels comparatively untested. Her emotional register trends consistently confident rather than strained. The elder’s arrival offers validation rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motive—reinvention through mapping and pigeons—is clear and expressed through concrete choices (charting dust, slicing the meteorite, sending birds). Interiority is lyrical yet legible, though contradiction is gentle rather than pressurized. The earned shift—accepting layering rather than erasure—reads credible but low-cost. Absence of on‑page relational pressure limits crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear—seeking the maze’s exit/meaning and decoding the mother’s code—and actions align (palm to copper, reading grain, choosing to return). Interiority is textured and particular to a child attuned to thresholds. However, internal contradiction is light; the piece rarely stages simultaneous competing impulses under pressure. The final stance (keeper of thresholds) lands but the felt cost remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s motive—to commune and learn the “rhythm of belonging”—is clear and drives her actions. Interiority is lyrical but largely one-note; we get awe and pull, not friction or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her choices (placing the feather twice, using instruments) align with motive but carry little visible cost. The final change is insight-heavy rather than earned through a tested dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren’s motive is clear and active from the outset, and her micro‑choices (pressing seeds to glass, following the teal, placing the final seed) align with that drive. Interiority is largely lyric rather than conflicted; she encounters minimal resistance and little contradictory impulse. The emotional register (“cheerful gloom,” “warm melancholy”) is embodied but rarely tests her limits. The final vow reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The performer’s motive—ordering chaos into fleeting harmony—is clear and embodied in repeated micro‑choices (dropping the bishop, reading the ink’s X, yielding to the tide). Interiority is particular enough (“trembling with purpose,” “calculated wilderness”) to feel owned by this mind. However, internal contradiction is light; he rarely risks or debates his method. The ending shows satisfaction rather than a charged renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—to inscribe a cosmic verse—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (taking the speck, slipping through gaps, inking her skin). Interiority reads specific and sensorial rather than labeled. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance, so her change (exile → pilgrimage) feels more earned by ritual than struggle. The visible cost (skin tinged with pale light, solitude reinterpreted) is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motive—to “illuminate value in the mundane”—is clear and enacted through her ritual, with embodied perception tied to glass, light, and water. Internal tension is modest (unsettled thoughts vs. ritual’s calming aim) and never forces a costly choice. Micro‑choices (tossing the stone, reading patterns, pocketing the talisman) align with her worldview but carry limited consequence. Strong specificity (glazier’s eye; prismatic readings) but little contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motive—transforming pain into a shared language—is clear and consistent, and her choices (placing and later opening the box) align with it. Interiority is vivid but skews declarative and serene, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The “hard softness” paradox surfaces a credible trait, yet we rarely see it tested against resistance. The change at the end feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.6)
    Arin’s motive (diagnose the gauge/restore hope) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it (organizing artisans, recording results, proposing a festival). However, interior contradiction and embodied emotion are minimal; he moves from intention to success with little friction or cost. The “lucidly watchful” quality informs method more than character struggle. The final stance feels earned conceptually but not wrestled for emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s drive is clear and particular, and her tactile choices (lighting the fire, tracing the negative, pressing it to the wall) align with her vocation. Interiority is sensorially grounded rather than labeled. However, contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal struggle are muted; the journey feels assured more than tested. The acceptance of the legacy’s burden lands but with little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—he wants to persuade the mirrors to show possibilities—yet internal contradiction is minimal and largely subsumed by lyric tone. His calm is embodied but not tested; there’s no counter‑impulse or doubt under pressure. Micro‑choices (timing the work in the hush, invoking lullabies) reveal values but without visible cost. Character reads more as function/ritual than a conflicted person.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—to convert ritual into binding peace—is clear and consistent, with embodied moments (placing the clipboard, writing clauses, steadying her voice). Interiority is mostly convincing if somewhat idealized; contradictory impulses (awe vs. resolve, fear vs. duty) surface but don’t bite hard. Secondary pressure from chieftains is light, limiting crucible intensity. The final endurance/renunciation (leaders laying down swords) reads earned by her steady tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s mingled profit/power motives and covert tenderness are legible and drive specific micro-choices (waiting for the lull, unsealing with a wire, lowering the egg). Internal contradiction is present but mostly conveyed through lyric summary rather than felt, moment-to-moment friction. His “amoral grace” reads as a stance, not just a label, though pressure rarely forces him into a visibly costly trade-off. Effective, if a touch insulated from true resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    Her motive (“defy the lullaby of conformity”) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (untangling threads, singing) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she meets little resistance and we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The “chaste courtesan” paradox is asserted but not tested. The final stance costs her nothing visible beyond implied risk.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene’s motive—to seek “half-lit epiphanies” in service of ethical storytelling—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (arranging dishes, lifting the stick, letting the fire die) align with it. Interiority is specific to her craft and sensibility, though largely contemplative with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation/commitment (reversing the hierarchy in future shows) reads earned but carries a subtle cost. Emotional embodiment leans lyric over visceral, sacrificing some friction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (collecting the moth wing, knotting reeds, staying as guardian). Interiority is embodied in tactile detail and sensory response, but internal contradiction is minimal, giving her arc a single-register purity. The final renunciation—accepting ephemerality while committing to memory—lands, though the cost is quiet. A slightly broader tension (doubt, risk, or competing pull) would deepen the character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive—preserving forgotten names—reads clear and coherent, and her tactile choices with rope and cylinder align with her craft-trained precision. However, internal contradiction is minimal; once she “forgives herself,” pressure softens and struggle feels frictionless. Embodied emotion (“snowmelt ardor”) lands, but the arc skirts cost. The traveler’s late arrival adds little challenge to her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks why “paths choose their walkers”—and her micro‑choices (placing the seal, whispering the incantation) align. The paradox of her sight finally admitting the present is a credible pivot. However, interiority is largely lyrical abstraction with limited embodied contradiction, and the felt cost of her transformation remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Nabu’s frugality and curiosity motivate coherent choices, but internal contradiction is minimal; he wants the covenant and pursues it without real friction. Interiority leans conceptual (“cosmic ledger,” “empirically ironic”) over embodied emotion. Micro-choices (schematics, timing, altar placement) align with motive yet expose little cost or doubt. He ends changed in status, not in psyche, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, but her interior conflict is minimal; she reads assured rather than pressured. Kovan’s shift is dramatized bodily (jaw unclenching), yet secondary characters mostly function as receivers. The “scheming pacifist” angle is compelling but under‑tested by resistance. The gratitude of the wanderer coda lands, though it avoids showing competing impulses in him before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s motive (retrieve the runaway dream to restore hope) is clear and drives every action. His agency through ritualized breath and craft specificity feels character‑particular. Internal contradiction is light—“erasing boundaries” vs. staying “firmly grounded” registers but never forces a painful choice. The ending promises duty rather than dramatizing a cost that bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—bridging guild tradition with the orchard’s living memory—drives concrete choices (mending ribbon, then lenses). Interiority is grounded in tactile action rather than labels, though internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wrestles with doubt. The mother–daughter dynamic adds warmth and purpose but applies gentle, not pressuring, counterforce. The earned shift is credible but low-cost, leaning toward serenity over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (pursuit of forbidden knowledge) drives consistent actions—inquiring, relocating to bathrooms, pressing the cameo—but interior conflict remains mostly conceptual. Embodied emotion lands in a few concrete touches (pollen on skin, bathroom acoustics), yet contradictions are lightly sketched. The renunciation of linear narrative is stated rather than wrestled with on the page. Strong coherence; limited felt cost in character terms.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (rescue the “unlearned lessons”), and actions align with her specialty. However, interior conflict is minimal; Selene rarely doubts, falters, or pays a felt personal price. The competence-forward portrayal reduces embodied emotion and ambiguity in peak beats. The sacrifice of a diary page and promise to record coordinates hint at cost but land conceptually rather than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (recapture verses to reach the garden), and her choices align (pressing the card, diving into ink), but internal contradiction and embodied cost are minimal. The “chimera twin discoverer” identity is vivid yet largely label-level; we rarely witness strain, fear, or hesitation under pressure. Her realization near the end reads earned enough but is tidy, without a visible sacrifice. Strong image-driven agency, light psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—“translate confusion into clarity”—and her choices align with that ethos. However, she encounters little internal resistance; competence eclipses contradiction, so we don’t see impulses in tension under pressure. Embodiment (the hum beneath her fingertips, the rope’s chords) grounds feeling without therapy-speak. The ending offers a modest earned stasis, though the cost is externalized (the clock frozen) more than internal.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is crystal clear and consistent—he seeks quiet—but internal contradiction is minimal and he faces little pressure that complicates his values. Embodied moments (“breath shallow,” “reverent hands”) help, yet he moves with near‑perfect competence. The energy beings do not act on him directly, so stress rarely degrades perception or triggers dilemma. The closing vow hints at endurance but exacts little felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—proving coincidence has meaning—but internal contradiction and embodied stress are minimal. The protagonist’s choices (aligning the prism, welcoming the caravan, vowing to map towers) show agency, yet they face little friction. Emotions are largely declared via lofty diction rather than dramatized through struggle in the body. The endurance at the end reads credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is explicit (“to sculpt identity from experience”) and consistently embodied in his choices to conjecture, measure, and record. Interiority is particular (preemptive nostalgia, grief/joy counterpoint), but internal contradiction never sharpens into a pressured trade-off. The shift from ache to resolve is credible yet low-cost. Overall, a coherent, felt psyche without a crucible-level decision.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he intends to “defy the gravity of hopelessness” through craft—and his micro-choices (chanting, lifting/lighting the knot, vowing to return) align. Interiority is lyrical rather than analytical, yet the tactile handling of the rag knot and the felt “lift” of hopelessness give embodied emotion. Internal contradiction is modest (serious playfulness) but not deeply stress‑tested. The final endurance/vow reads earned but the cost is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive and a coherent inner lens anchor the chronicler, and her gentle agency (placing the cicada, reading ripples) aligns with that aim. However, contradictory impulses are faint; she rarely strains against herself or the scene’s pressure. The late realization (“true foretelling lay not in predicting words but in feeling intention”) is earned but low‑friction. Relationship dynamics with the chieftains are observed, not engaged, limiting crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio’s motive—to harvest and taste silences to ease a bunker-born claustrophobia—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (climb, deploy doll, limit exposure). Embodied feeling (“chest…like a rubber band”) grounds him. Internal contradiction is light; fear dissolves rather than contesting him at the peak, so pressure on character is modest. The change—learning restraint and reframing cramped space as vast—is earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motive—teaching silence—is clear and her tactics (whispers, speed adjustments, opening the vial) align. A flicker of inner conflict appears (“she must first dissolve the agitation within herself”) but isn’t stress-tested against real opposition. Emotional embodiment is mostly textural rather than pressured. Competence dominates over contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear goal and trait coherence (wisely adventurous) propel Mina’s choices, but interior conflict is thin and largely replaced by setting description. The time limit and throne’s promise don’t register as competing pressures on her psyche. Key actions—following the sigil, ascending, placing the flake—land, yet with little felt cost. The arc resolves, but without a meaningful renunciation or contradiction playing out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motivation (“to teach the suffocating darkness to breathe”) drives concrete choices: tapping the door, thinning the veil, stepping through, and leaving the ring. The paradox—isolating to create connection—adds texture, though interior contradiction remains more stated than dramatized. The renunciation cost (no retreat; leaving the ring) lands credibly. Interiority stays lyric and object-focused rather than deeply embodied, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—wariness from pyramid‑scheme trauma versus seduction by the “quantum promise”—are clear and dramatized in the hesitation before placing the bolt. Micro‑choices (agreeing to volunteer, securing the bolt, replying to the texts) align with a consistent worldview. Emotional texture is embodied through the bolt’s “remembered” pressure and the mushrooms’ pulse. The ending leans into a tidy self‑justifying uplift that slightly softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lian’s motive is clear and consistent, and his choices (cranking, listening, prying up the floor) align with it. Interiority is sensorial and character‑filtered, though internal conflict is minimal and his path feels largely unopposed. The “dynasty ender” label promises sharper contradiction than the scene delivers. The conceptual cost lands, but emotional struggle is light.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The knight’s motive—shifting from solitary quest to an allegiance to performance and possibility—is legible and consistent. Interiority is vivid if abstract, with embodied notes (“each breath a tiny bell”) anchoring feeling. The contradictory pull between withdrawal and invitation is present but not sharply dramatized under pressure. The final renunciation (armor melting into moss) reads earned but carries modestly articulated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Amelia’s motive—to witness and magnify small kindnesses—drives concrete actions (using the button method, filing under “Acts of Compassion,” presenting to the supervisor). Interiority is consistent and embodied through tactile engagement with dust and paper rather than label-speak. The internal contradiction (broken-hearted yet hopeful) is present but softly rendered; pressure tests it only modestly. The cost is felt as ongoing grief accepted rather than solved.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s resourceful, underestimated nature drives the action (salvaged key, puddle‑map), and her motive—countering the regime’s indifference—reads cleanly. Interiority is mostly implied through images rather than contradictory impulses under pressure, keeping emotional cost generalized. Micro‑choices exist (following reflections, inserting the key, speaking the code) but land without friction. The ending accepts a long fight, but the felt on‑page cost to Mara remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and singular—he must hush the coded prophecy—and the choice to whisper instead of roar is a concrete tactic aligned with that motive. Interiority is sensorially rich but offers little contradiction or doubt; he executes with near-perfect competence. The father/fog language flashback adds a touch of texture but doesn’t sharpen a dilemma. The change is credible endurance rather than hard trade-off, leaving the cost mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Lira’s ordered devotion to decoding leaves drives every act. Interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; she meets little resistance, so contradictory impulses don’t surface. The transformation reads earned but low-cost, skewing toward wonder over struggle. Specific micro-choices (prodding moss, erecting monuments) reveal her values through action.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives are clear and aligned to action: curiosity and a pull toward uncertainty propel her to test, follow, and finally renounce rigidity. Interiority appears via tactile perceptions (ozone, old iron) and specific choices (placing the compass on the brazier). Internal conflict is present but gentle; the “uncertainly certain” tension reads more as credo than live contradiction under pressure. The final stance shift (trusting uncertainty, offering it to planners) is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear (redeem the coin and interrogate the “weight of names”), and interiority is concrete enough to feel character‑particular. The luminous regret versus disciplined precision provides a credible tension, though contradictory impulses seldom clash on the page under pressure. Her micro‑choices (measuring a fire not lit, whispering the dragon’s name, deciding to push beyond textbooks) align with her ethos. The closing shift from regret to gratitude reads earned but low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s motive—harvesting confessions and healing them with laughter—reads clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (following the chords, pressing the tooth, risking a joke) align. Interiority is lyric but somewhat generalized; “modestly fearless” appears as label more than a lived contradiction. The emotional cost is present as a “luminous ache,” but her struggle feels low-risk and relatively unopposed. Strong image-based reactions to tools and sounds reveal her, though complexity remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s drive—to extract a “mathematics of mercy” from her own trauma—is clear and consistent, and her embodied engagement with the strap, bark, and light grounds emotion. Internal conflict (enduring pain vs. seeking insight) operates in scene via the violet flashes as price. A touch of diagnostic abstraction (“proprioceptively enhanced,” the neat formula) slightly tidies the messiness of her psyche. Still, her final renunciation/repricing (lifting the strap as promise) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (honor overlooked histories) and actions align (decoding paintings, releasing the fragment), with a tangible sentimental cost tied to the father. Interiority is vivid but largely assured; little contradictory impulse is dramatized before letting the heirloom dissolve. Micro‑choices exist but are friction‑light, so the final renunciation lands more as grace than struggle. The piece could benefit from a sharper moment of hesitation when the fragment slips away.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s competence and tactile choices (lanterning the mainspring, climbing the creaking ladder, engaging the circuit) are clear and rooted in her observant, ghost‑tuned mindset. Interiority lands through embodied perceptions (“weightless burden,” collar tug), but there’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost resisting her aim. The final shift to “quiet purpose” feels earned by action more than by deep internal struggle. Strong, specific, but emotionally low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mara’s goal—to compress eternity into a moment—is clear and drives action, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or pays an emotional price beyond abstract risk. Interiority leans declarative over embodied, though the tactile frost/ink choices reveal a consistent temperament. The peak choice (spiral, press slam) aligns with her craft, but we don’t feel a deep personal cost or fear. Character reads distinct but remains more emblem of theme than fully conflicted person.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s drive to transmute a failed rebellion into cultural renewal is clear and consistent, with credible melancholy shading her choices. Her agency is active—she times the storm, veils the mirrors, and recites—but opposition from the elders collapses a bit easily, limiting felt struggle. Interiority is present (“triumph and regret,” “burnished sorrow”) though not deeply embodied under pressure. The final pocketed shard signals a meaningful endurance/renunciation rather than a sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Alder’s competence, ritual focus, and gentle reverence for tools create a distinct, credible protagonist with clear motivation. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost under pressure—he never meaningfully falters, doubts, or pays. Interiority remains largely devotional rather than conflicted. The promise to guard the chamber hints at burden but arrives without on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motive and method (petrichor collector seeking the compass and “hinged awakenings”) are clear and consistent, and her key choices—stepping onto the water, reaching for the crystal—align with them. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves through awe rather than struggle, with little visible cost beyond conceptual surrender. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific but rarely pressured. The hinted loss of the compass is ambiguous and not leveraged to test her values.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira’s drive is clear (to translate complexity into accessible forms), and her micro-choices—stepping through the arch, using the slide, choosing a layered tableau—align with that. However, internal contradiction is faint; she rarely wavers or pays a visible emotional price. Embodied detail (salt, scars) helps, but conflict-light scenes limit depth. The recognition of her child-self is affecting but lands as affirmation more than contested change.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—Mara seeks to understand night‑blooms and to thaw her “lingering winter.” Interiority is embodied in images (postcards, lenses, tears) rather than therapy‑speak. The epiphany leans easy because the glass/postcards mechanic grants swift revelation with limited friction. Still, the shift from doubt to charged acceptance reads earned within this quiet register.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s drive is clear and consistent, and her actions align with that motive. However, interior contradiction is light; “searing reverie” repeats as label more than embodied tension, yielding few pressured micro‑choices. The negotiations and descent rarely force ambiguous trade‑offs that reveal layered values. The change at the end reads as resolve affirmed rather than a costly internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motivation (revive the town without “false comfort”) and a consistent ethic of refusal guide his choices, but interior conflict is mostly thematic rather than embodied. The temptation to “easy restoration” is named, not dramatized through struggle. Micro‑choices (opening the bottle with a question; turning the sigh into a blueprint) show values in action. Emotional texture stays coolly conceptual, limiting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    Harel’s motive—archiving emotional patterns by immersing in the orchard and decoding a prophecy—is clear and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (lifting, shaving, sealing) that reveal character. Internal contradiction is mild: awe vs. duty brushes the surface but rarely strains him. The “weight settle like dew” signals cost, though it remains conceptual rather than felt at knife’s edge. Still, his final act (recording and sealing) is earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives (reopen the covenant; feel “borrowed time”) are clear and embodied (“furiously tranquil”) and her choices—placing the acorn cap, surrendering the present, planting the seed—align with them. Internal contradiction is present but subtle, more tonal than pressured. The absence of a counter‑force or relational pressure limits the felt cost of her acceptance. Still, her final act reads earned by the scene’s build.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he volunteers to transform the bell from clamor to listening—and his actions align with that goal. Interiority is competent and grounded in process but shows little contradictory impulse or genuine risk. The “retiring” of the rope hints at a felt cost, yet the emotional struggle remains muted. Strong competence under pressure, light conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear—he seeks to honor fallen stars and find strength in vulnerability—and his micro‑choices (tracing paths, pulling threads into the lantern, making a vow) align. Interiority is poetic and character‑specific, though largely unopposed by concrete counter‑impulses. The internal conflict (vulnerability vs. strength) is stated more than dramatized under pressure. Still, the vow and attendant ritual reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he aims to preserve silence—and his final choice to honor the covenant reads as an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost. Interiority is filtered through concrete attention to wind, glass, and ghosts, avoiding therapy‑speak. The internal conflict is subdued rather than oppositional; tension comes from restraint more than contradiction, limiting peak intensity. Still, micro‑choices (tracing the ruby, lifting and aligning the box) reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive—to “understand the texture of time”—is clear and consistent, and her actions (scouring the ledger, unearthing the hourglass, fitting the urn) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she encounters little resistance and registers few contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied perception is strong (“minutes stretching like thin silk”), but the arc edges toward serene competency rather than hard-won change. The villagers’ presence doesn’t add interpersonal pressure, so the crucible stays internal and relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (tend the lagoon; honor the incomplete), and micro‑choices (placing the feather, whispering verses, arranging stones) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he’s certain rather than tested—so the arc reads as steady devotion rather than struggle. Emotional cost is mostly conceptual (renouncing “flawless endings”) and doesn’t bite on the page. The “warmly attentive” trait shows but rarely complicates him.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation and competence are clear and coherent—Mara’s “brazen calm” against the six‑month clock and her meticulous ritual work align tightly. However, internal contradiction and felt struggle are minimal; she rarely faces friction that exposes competing impulses. The council’s reversal arrives without Mara confronting a sharp, character‑testing moment. The serenity reads admirable but flattens complexity under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arin’s motive—reject awe in favor of inquiry—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (deploying the amber, whispering an “offer” to the tower). However, internal contradiction and cost are light; his “rebellion” faces little friction on the page. Emotional texture is largely one register of reverent curiosity, with minimal degradation under pressure. The final belonging surge reads earned but low‑price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and coherent—he’s a ritual gardener translating birds to re‑seed a scarred place—but internal contradiction is light. The weight of ancestors versus the serenity of his task registers, yet he faces little on‑page resistance. His micro‑choices (which pod to release, when to scatter) are specific and aligned with his role. The final relief (“the weight of his ancestors lift”) lands but with modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rook’s motive—to become a “keeper of connections”—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (arranging the prism, following the riddle, resealing the leaf) align with it. Interiority is sensory and character‑specific for a dog (ears “pruning the hush,” scent‑anchored memory), though contradiction is light; he rarely wrestles with competing impulses. The renewal at the end is credible but low‑friction. A slightly deeper cost or hesitation under pressure would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear motive (seeking orientation amid collapse) is enacted through concrete micro-choices: sketching, stepping into the temporal field, aligning the compass, and later convening family. Interiority is image-led and character-specific (the applique as a personal relic), with a credible emotional progression from trepidation to resolve. Internal contradiction is mild—there’s yearning and caution but little on-page friction between opposing impulses. Still, the final renunciation of passivity into “pilgrimage” reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysander’s motives are clear and particular—amend a betrayal through a ritual that suits a “chivalrous thief.” Interiority is vivid (“cautious abandon,” breath coaxing gears) and actions align with ethos. However, internal contradiction is faint; he rarely hesitates or missteps, so pressure reveals little new about him. The vow to be a “bridge” feels earned but carries limited on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive—to unbind silence and chronicle erased small acts—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (the walking patterns, retrieving and placing the scroll). The paradox of ex–crisis actor turned survivor gives her texture without over-explaining. Interiority is mediated through the narrator, so her contradictions are felt but not deeply contested on the page. The cost is present as a “weight on her shoulders,” though it remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s desire to find the “shape of home” is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (using the feather, pressing deeper, returning the stone) align with that drive. The internal friction—painful memory versus compulsion to continue—registers, though it stays mostly lyric rather than dramatically contested. Her realization reads earned through tactile engagement (vibration, scent) rather than bald assertion. The cost of letting go of a fixed idea of home is felt, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (self-forgiveness) and actionable interiority (decoding threads, arranging stones, releasing the pawn) make him vivid and particular. The “fierce repose” contradiction reads embodied rather than labeled. However, resistance feels low—his path through the maze rarely strains him to failure or backslide. The final renunciation is earned but almost too seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—pay the canyon’s debt through art—drives concrete choices (urging Lio to speak, painting the mural, writing across the sky). Interiority is present but not deeply contradictory; her “defiant spirit softened” hints at conflict without a hard trade‑off dramatized. The personal cost skews conceptual (“acceptance of loss”) rather than a specific, felt forfeiture. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in a credible stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist’s uncertainty is embodied (acid bite, clock‑gear heart) and turns toward resolve through tactile, specific actions (tracing pockmarks, aligning the charm). Motivation—forge doubt into purpose—is clear and consistent with choices. Internal conflict resolves a bit neatly, with scant visible cost beyond “surrendering fear.” Still, micro‑choices under pressure reveal character credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (keep a hidden promise; seek “temporary eternity”) and actions align (entering the caves, taking the shell, unlocking the painted chest, recommitting through the new canvas). Interiority is specific to a painter’s sensibility, though internal contradiction is mild and largely asserted via “intimate aloofness” rather than dramatized friction. The ending reads as an Earned Stasis—he accepts solitude as the cost of keeping the oath—but the cost remains soft. Greater on‑page strain or a sacrificed alternative would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—to prove whispers outreach shouts—guides concrete choices (placing and cracking the cork) and her embodied emotion (“screaming tenderness”) feels specific. Internal contradiction is gentler than pressured: uncertainty/tremor versus fierce love, but not a jagged clash under duress. Secondary relationship pressure is off‑stage (fisherman), limiting crucible tensions. Still, the final renunciation of the vial’s contents reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—she maps loss and builds an engine from salvaged parts—but internal contradiction is minimal, with little on‑page friction beyond fatigue and sorrow absorption. Embodied details (thin air, warm censer foot, soldering) ground emotion. Micro‑choices (answering midnight calls, integrating the censer foot, recording coordinates) reveal values. The final acceptance reads earned, though the psychic price could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motive—to convert the glass eye into a communal mirror—drives clear actions (the concealment, the confrontation). The involuntary truthfulness shapes behavior credibly, though inner contradiction is underplayed given the stakes. Emotional embodiment is present but skewed toward abstract diction over felt, body-level stress. The change at the end reads as acceptance of stewardship rather than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlowe’s motive—to decode the stranger’s gesture—drives clear micro‑choices (watching the tide, aligning the flower, lighting the lamp). Interiority feels particular (opal dock reflection, boutonnière against his heart) and not generic. The internal conflict is gentle (isolation vs. duty/hope) and could bear a sharper contradictory pull under pressure. The final renunciation/acceptance (keeping vigil, becoming witness) reads earned, if low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motive (honoring a deathbed promise) is clear and drives concrete choices: he follows ants, seats the chip, and chooses not to step through. Interiority is vivid but mostly lyric-assertive; we rarely see contradictory impulses collide on the page beyond the brief “rope around his chest” urging a choice. The renunciation (turning back) carries some felt cost but is cushioned by certainty, muting struggle. Still, actions align with motives and yield a credible earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear—she seeks to end recurring dreams—and her choice to kiss the orb arises from the established drive. Interiority is mostly archetypal and image-led, with limited contradictory impulses beyond doubt/curiosity. The retinue exists as backdrop rather than a pressure crucible. The final shift (from disenchanted to tempered) is earned but pays a modest cost (solitude, secrets spent) rather than a wrenching trade.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (to “capture the density of presence”), and the alchemist’s actions align with it. However, interior conflict is minimal and largely untested; we get little contradiction or cost within him. The friends read as a chorus more than distinct pressures. The closing vow signals change, but with limited felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular interiority: envy of past selves versus present mortality animates concrete micro‑choices (unrolling, writing, stepping outside). Motivation (“to distill chaos into narrative”) drives action and remains consistent. Embodied emotion lands via tactile scroll, firelight, and thin air. The shift to accept the grave as marker, not sentence, reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s motive—to unveil “ordinary miracles”—is clear and coherently embodied through tactile ritual and reverent craft. The anosmia meaningfully informs her perception and choices (translating vibration into emotion). However, internal contradiction is faint; pressure remains gentle, so we rarely see competing impulses tested. The final acceptance feels earned but largely unopposed, limiting depth of change.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific—she seeks to transmute scars into healing runes—and her actions align with this aim via the tea ritual. Interiority is embodied through tactile choices (quill to tea, managed breath), with ancestry (grandmother’s chant) adding texture. Internal contradiction is mild; the piece leans more toward serene commitment than friction. The change at the end (accepting scars as luminous verses) reads earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear desire (deliver an overdue apology) fused with guilt and a history of harm gives her credible drive. Interiority is textured and particular to her odd vocation, and micro‑choices (placing the bottle, arranging scores, whispering the verse) align with motive. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—she’s penitent more than torn—so the pressure never bites as hard as it could. Still, the final renunciation of gossip‑as‑weapon and acceptance of an “imperfect miracle” reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear—she seeks to “unravel cosmic illusions”—and her key actions (stepping onto the map, placing the dictionary on the crystal) align. However, interiority remains abstract and generalized; there’s little embodied conflict or contradictory impulse beyond the conceptual paradox of “journeying inward while walking out.” The emotional cost of vanishing is implied but under‑felt on the page. Strong concept, limited psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he’s tasked with “measuring the exact point where the tide met the sky” to learn what clocks measure—filtered through tactile, embodied ritual. Interiority feels specific (whistle echo, the key’s hum, floor tremors), though internal contradiction is minimal and the epiphany leans tidy. Micro‑choices (squinting, regulating flow, lifting and turning the key, whispering the backward count) align with motive. The change is an inward reframing rather than a hard cost, but it is earned by preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator’s competence and tactile worldview are clear, and micro‑choices (testing, calibrating, deploying) align with the professional aim. However, interior contradiction is thin; “letting go” functions more as a stated thesis than a pressure-tested conflict. The workers remain a faceted backdrop rather than active crucibles. The final stance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive and contradiction (probability discipline vs. gambling impulse) are clear and drive concrete choices—placing the coin, choosing to descend, and lifting the lantern. Grief from her mother’s heart attack shades her actions but isn’t deeply embodied beyond a few lines. Her final act—writing a theorem that fuses certainty with chance—reads earned, though the personal cost is understated. The interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular without lapsing into labels.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—choosing isolation to “teach endings how to begin”—is clear and consistent, and her final renunciation of estrangement reads earned. However, most of her conflict is narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choices; the key interpersonal beat (with Lena) is summarized. The emotional cost of dissolving her practice is implied more than embodied, though “stepping out of the booth” helps land it.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist’s motive—renewing a covenant by preserving “the weight of small moments”—is consistent and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (placing the locket, writing in walnut ink). Interiority is sensorial and specific, with a credible mix of dread and reverence. However, internal contradiction is minimal and pressure on his values is gentle; no sharp trade‑off tests him. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific, and her choices (accepting the puzzle, assembling the crew, sending the rock onward) align with her ethos. The “desperately jocular” note appears in texture and stance, not just label. However, internal contradiction is light; we don’t feel a competing impulse that complicates her competence. The cost of letting the fragment go is implied rather than felt in her body on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific, but pressure reveals little contradiction or cost; Lira remains serenely competent throughout. The interiority is vivid (language through skin, sensing tree sorrow) yet largely unopposed. The culminating realization risks neatness (“required more than sight... a compass forged from empathy”) rather than an earned, conflicted turn. A small renunciation or misstep under pressure would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator’s paradox—“confidently uncertain”—is character‑specific and drives the choice to proceed while interrogating assumptions. Embodiment leans metaphorical rather than tactile, with few concrete physical reactions under pressure. The choice to use the dry pen to “edit history” aligns with motive and prior error. Change occurs (listening over control), but the on‑page cost of that shift is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    Arlen’s motive is clear and embodied in specific actions (camera clicks as beats, hands shaping signs), and Lira’s vow gives a quiet continuation. Internal contradiction is light; joy and sorrow coexist but rarely strain choices under pressure. The cost of being forgotten is more thematic than felt in-scene, keeping the arc lovely but low-friction. Still, the character actions align with motives and reveal a coherent, particular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motive (rescuing the mentor’s promise) and a felt flaw-to-grace arc give cohesion, with embodied reactions (“volcanic tenderness,” tactile tracing of the tapestry) grounding emotion. However, internal conflict is largely declared rather than dramatized under pressure; the redemption feels relatively frictionless. The most vivid crucible is mirror-judgment via the vandalized self‑portrait and glyphs, but the piece skims the cost. Still, actions align with motives and the final renunciation reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motive—transmuting sterile despair into a shared dream—reads clean and drives tangible actions (the progressive drumming, perching higher). Interiority is mostly implied through sensory coupling rather than embodied contradiction, leaving little friction or flaw on the page. The rebellion trait coheres but seldom exacts visible cost. Still, her micro-choices align with the final reconfiguration credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Milo sets himself a test and pursues it step by step—but interior conflict is light and largely untested. His competence faces little resistance; emotions are mostly inferred from action rather than embodied contradiction. The “calculated spontaneity” line hints at a tension but it’s not dramatized into a costly choice. The endurance/change at the end reads as affirmation more than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The guardian’s motive is clear and consistent (to teach darkness the value of stars), but interior contradiction and cost are minimal. Agency exists (raising/aligning/lowering the mirror; weaving ripples), yet choices rarely carry visible trade‑offs. The figure reads more emblem than person, limiting embodied emotion. Still, micro‑choices under pressure are present in the patient pacing and deliberate calibration of light.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s motive is crystal clear and character-particular (teaching curiosity over rote), and her actions align with it (organizing the displays, cradling the grotto). However, internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are mostly absent; she meets little on‑page resistance. Emotions are conveyed lyrically but with limited embodied stress. The final endurance (“the quiet would not be broken”) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s internal contradiction (“combative tenderness” vs. hunger to break free) is clear and embodied in small physical beats (boots slipping, breath before song). Her choices drive the plot: stepping onto the dock, placing the scrimshaw, singing twice, and letting it go. Some motivation is told rather than dramatized (“She knew the island was a test”), which softens the felt cost. The final renunciation reads credible but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive—cultivating lightness in grief under a coercive happiness regime—is clear and coherently embodied through her whittling, narration, and object placement. The moral grayness is acknowledged and felt in her acceptance of a “quiet transformation” rather than open rebellion. Interiority is particular (whispering to dried flowers, sensing grief’s fragrance) and actions align with her purpose. The final renunciation of applause reads as an earned endurance with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (to dissolve sacred boundaries) and actions align (paraphrasing the chant), but internal conflict is minimal and largely untested. The “tremor of certainty” moves swiftly to certainty without a credible competing impulse. Interiority is evocative yet generalized; we don’t see concrete stakes that challenge his aesthetic drive. The resulting change reads as chosen rather than wrestled for.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Selene’s drive (to translate her colorblindness into a new palette) is concrete and enacted through specific micro-choices (pairing plants, bartering pigments, arranging patterns). “Innocently cunning” reads on the page via her barters and gentle manipulations rather than as a mere label. Internal tension is soft—her renunciation of “perfect symmetry” lacks on‑page resistance, so cost feels conceptual more than felt. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in an earned acceptance of imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (curiosity, kinship) is clear and consistent, and actions align with it (“powerfully gentle” taps, dismissal of colleagues’ grandiosity). Interiority is evocative but light on contradiction; there’s little genuine pressure to force a conflicted choice. The character’s micro‑choices (aligning the lens, striking notes, lowering the lamp) build a credible, calm endurance rather than transformation. The final stance is earned, though the cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation (to teach withering to bloom) is clear and enacted via concrete choices: folding cranes, following coordinates, tracing the stencil on the rose. Interiority is specific (fingers stained with copper and grief), and the subdued ardor reads as a believable contradiction. Pressure is gentle rather than testing, so costs feel modest. The transformation convinces, but we never see her truly risk failure or foreclose a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear (map patterns after the crash), rendered through tactile actions with tape, cards, and journal. Interiority is specific but shows limited contradiction; she rarely wavers or pays a visible price. Micro-choices (aligning tape with tunnels, kneeling, promising the unseen architects) reveal values but under soft pressure. The final acceptance of “compass over burden” reads earned but lightly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent: he seeks forbidden knowledge and accepts cost by renouncing pattern and certainty. Interiority is embodied through irregular steps, tactile contact with light, and sensory detail, avoiding therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears (anguished joy, heavy yet uplifted), though conflict could deepen with one sharper on‑page hesitation. The final endurance—choosing randomness as a discipline—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear motive (preserve hope) and consistent temperament; micro-choices (lifting, aligning, whispering to, and returning the stone; recording new footage) reveal character. Internal tension—luminous regret vs. duty—exists but stays gentle rather than oppositional. The change (from regret to earned gratitude) lands, though it’s not driven by sharply contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—repair trust while balancing self‑respect and compassion—is clear and embodied through concrete ritual choices. Interiority is specific (the “candle in wind” wobble) and actions align with value testing. However, resistance is soft: the chameleon’s quick “approving light” eases pressure, making the earn of change feel a touch tidy. The cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—the “closure seeker” who reads scars drives every choice. Interiority is sensorially embodied (chlorinated air, cool stone, humming roots), though internal contradiction is minimal. The character adapts tactics (coffee rings → hourglass alignment) under pressure. The closing acceptance feels earned but pays a relatively modest emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks where unused love is stored—and her actions (psychometry, humming, retrieving the tin) align. Interiority is sensorial and particular, though inner contradiction is light and she rarely faces a counter‑impulse beyond awe. Embodied emotion lands in lines like “feeling the weight of unsent affection,” but the cost of taking that love in is more implied than dramatized. The final renunciation—whispering goodbye and leaving—reads earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he seeks to free trapped creativity—and his actions (aligning, tracing, relinquishing the instrument) align. Interiority is lyric and particular, if largely single‑note; contradictory impulses (rapture vs. fatigue/doubt) surface but never truly clash on the page. The change is credible: he pays with exhaustion and surrender of the tool. Still, the internal struggle feels friction‑light for the stakes claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guard’s motive (to rekindle a dead world) is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction and cost are light; he meets little resistance and succeeds without visible sacrifice beyond persistent dreamlessness. Embodied emotion appears—pulse tug, odd warmth—but remains largely abstract and lyric. His micro‑choices (lifting the clock, chanting, threading wave functions) align with motive yet aren’t pressured enough to reveal a hierarchy of values. The final softening reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is explicit and coherent (to reclaim his “internal wilderness”), and actions align (sleeping to translocate, placing the gear). Interiority is vivid but largely unopposed; there’s little embodied contradiction or cost under pressure. The realization lands more as an articulated thesis than a hard‑won conflict between impulses. Still, the gear‑guided choice at the engine reveals character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motive (to reclaim dormant courage) is clear and embodied in small actions (clutching the star-stamped ticket, consenting to the cave’s test). Interiority is lyrical but somewhat generalized; contradictory impulses are muted, making the transformation feel gentle rather than hard-won. The “leash breaks” memory adds texture but doesn’t force a live, pressured trade-off on the page. Still, her closing recommitment reads earned by the ferry journey and chest opening.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bellhop’s choices (remaining at the staircase, selecting and placing the bolt) are concrete and motivated, and the guests’ desire “to understand the cost of safety” is clear. However, interiority is largely generalized; we rarely inhabit a single mind under pressure. Contradictory impulses are implied (safety vs. fracture/hope) but not dramatized in embodied, character‑specific terms. The earned renunciation at the end reads more collective than personal, blunting micro‑choice complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a handful of embodied beats (“trembling fingers,” quiet pride) ground the titan, but internal contradiction is minimal. He rarely falters or reveals blind spots; choices read competent and clean rather than pressured. Still, actions align with motive and the modesty/power contrast gives him texture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s motivation (“to discover why some paths disappear”) is clear and consistent, and her embodied memory of bleaching lends texture. However, interior contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices are thin; much of her arc is contemplative rather than pressured. The partnership with Eli never tests their relationship, so character pressure stays low. The realization at the end reads earned but low‑cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (seeking meaning) and a distinct trait (“awkwardly confident”) guide concrete actions—listening, whispering, tracing the glyph. Interiority is present but leans abstract; contradictions are mild and cost is soft. The agency is credible, and the final vow feels earned by prior attentiveness. However, we don’t see a palpable sacrifice or an on‑page flaw exacting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motive and decisive agency (she decodes, sacrifices memory, reframes the act to the community). Interiority is evocative but short on contradiction; fear vs duty barely strains her. The memory sacrifice lands as cost but her competence smooths resistance. The elders’ pressure is mostly reported, not felt, which limits crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is specific and embodied—pine needle on cheek, thumb on the photo’s ridge, breath as metronome—showing a credible struggle between panic and chosen calm. Micro‑choices (taking out the photo, pressing it flat, whispering a promise) align with a drive to endure. The label “quietly talented” is ornamental, and “anchor optimism in realism” edges toward abstract self‑explanation. Still, the final stance feels earned by prior sensory tactics rather than unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motive—an artist redesigning his approach after long discouragement—is clear and consistently embodied by tactile choices (handling the broken tarot, arranging a spiral, descending). Contradictory impulses (fear of fragmentation vs. urge to plunge into necessary darkness) play against each other credibly. The transformation—reframing brokenness as canvas—feels earned by on‑page acts rather than declared. Emotional texture is specific (salt, dust, algae glow) rather than label‑only.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—to learn why time slows in crisis—is clear, and his “serene anger” provides a credible, contradictory emotional engine. He makes purposeful micro-choices (releasing ink, interrogating patterns, accepting a mission). The near-disappearance provides a felt risk but the cost isn’t fully paid on the page. Interiority is vivid if somewhat generalized at moments by reiterated abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motive is clear and consistent—ignite dissent despite personal risk—and her decisive act (slipping the letter into the conduit) aligns with it. The “bravely conflicted” interior shows, but mostly in summary rather than embodied struggle at the moment of action. Micro‑choices beyond the central insertion are sparse, so contradiction under pressure isn’t deeply dramatized. Cost is implied (risk of “frozen preservation”) more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s motive (to weave continuity, refuse violence) is clear and consistent, and her choices (whispering to roses, guiding the boy, organizing sandbags) align. However, her internal conflict is minimal; pacifism reads as settled identity rather than contested under pressure. Embodied emotion is mostly lyricized rather than felt in contradictory impulses. The resolution costs her little on the page beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear desire (“to catch the echo of a goddess”) drives concrete actions (planting, then lifting the rail spike, chanting). Interiority is particular and image-led, though internal contradiction is slight; the “cool-headed” steadiness limits visible struggle. Micro-choices (step left/right/forward by pulses) show embodied pursuit but not much cost or ambivalence. The closing acceptance—setting the echo free rather than trapping it—reads earned but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motive (to unearth hidden truths) is clear and coherently expressed through her lineage and habits, and her micro-choices (slotting the nib, forming a hypothesis) align with that drive. However, internal contradiction is thin; she encounters little friction to test or complicate her values. Embodied emotion appears (weight of the nib, grin of “solemn playfulness”) but under minimal pressure. The closing handoff to the journalist implies conviction rather than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motive—hushing old guilt—is clear and drives her concrete actions (stitching amber to the recorder, promising the lab will soothe). Interiority is lyrical and specific, though contradictions are modest; she rarely wavers or pays a visible price beyond effort. The final renunciation/pledge reads earned by the work she undertakes. Slight absence of live resistance or missteps keeps it from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (to discover meaning) and actions align (mandala work, questioning the tile), but interior conflict is minimal and largely frictionless. Embodied emotion appears (“warm stone at the base of her spine”), yet much is rendered in abstractions (“unlearning,” “emergent hush”). The final shift reads earned but low-cost. Relationship pressure is absent; the violinist arrives as a coda, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motive is clear and consistent—engineering compassion—and his key choice (kneeling, reading the chips, renaming) aligns with it. Interiority surfaces via tactile engagement with the stone and the “retrocognitively trapped” state, but contradictory impulses are faint and mostly abstract. The dissolution of his past at the end offers a credible cost but is thematically smooth rather than hard‑won. Strong presence, modest internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—the ghost seeks one final, meaningful encore—expressed through concrete actions (finding the coin, singing, amplifying echoes). Interiority is lyric but largely one-note longing; contradictory impulses or risk are minimal. The shopkeeper’s brief presence adds a human counterpoint but not substantial relational pressure. The final renunciation (letting the final echo drift) is gentle but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—an affectionate skeptic trying to verify a drugless telepathy recall—reads clear and consistent, and her embodied engagement with tools (brushes, LEDs, geode) reveals character. The doubt-versus-hope tension gives texture but rarely bites into a true dilemma. Her micro-choices (calibrating pulses, mapping light to skin, closing her eyes for the test) are purposeful but largely frictionless. The ending softens skepticism into belief without an on-page cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, particular motivation (to map and give voice) with tactile practice and micro‑choices (placing the leaf, releasing the final droplet). Interiority is present but largely serene; contradictory impulses and visible cost are minimal. The closing realization feels earned by the ritual, though it skirts neatness. Lack of friction or error under pressure keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motive is clear and sustained—decipher the prophecy and enact it—but her inner conflict remains minimal, with little friction beyond focused competence. We get specific, embodied actions (turning the hourglass, placing buttons) but few contradictory impulses under pressure. The risk of stepping onto the “thin bridge” is evocative yet underdeveloped as a costed choice. The piece privileges mythic assurance over textured ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (atonement/redemption) and embodied guilt, with small micro‑choices (nightly coding, drinking vials, entering the pass). Internal conflict is present but resolves a bit too smoothly, with little visible cost or contradiction under pressure. “Prudently daring” is declared and lightly dramatized; more friction at the pass would deepen credibility. The final shift reads earned but emotionally low‑risk for a spy carrying lethal guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s motive—distilling the river’s memory into a “single, clean stitch”—is coherent and particular, with the needle tethering grief, craft, and intent. Interiority stays concrete via sensory fixation (gutters ticking, mist veils), but internal contradiction and cost are muted; he rarely wrestles on the page beyond patient endurance. His micro-choices (waiting, listening, lifting the needle, renunciation) align with motive yet face little opposing pressure. The closing acceptance feels earned but low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—to test and understand why the oasis resists change—is clear and drives tactile choices (setting the lantern, tracing sun patterns, offering light to hives). Her interiority feels particular (potter’s patience, attention to rhythm), but contradictory impulses are minimal, keeping pressure soft. The renunciation of control (leaving the lantern as beacon) provides a modest, earned cost. A deeper internal wobble under pressure would have heightened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motive—bringing light to dark corners—is coherent and embodied through tactile choices (the latch, the planting). Interiority is specific (“protected vulnerability,” ritual with the rosebush) but her contradictions never tighten into a hard trade‑off. She reads competent and tender yet faces little internal friction beyond tone. The ending’s endurance choice (to keep tending) is credible but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (“translate isolation into independence”), and actions align, but the interiority leans abstract and serene, with little contradictory impulse or visible cost. Mira rarely confronts friction; success feels assured once the ritual begins. The emotional beats (“brittle awakenings,” “coexistence”) read more as affirmed concepts than contested wants. The final vow is credible yet lightly earned given minimal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motive is clear and particular (a ghostwriter seeking “the thread that connects all things”), and her actions align with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from curiosity to acceptance with little friction. The choice to “rejoin” reads genuine but low-cost. Embodied emotion is present through sensory proxies rather than competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her cautious temperament informs her tactics. However, interior conflict is limited; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price. The competence-forward execution (algorithm, transmitter, clean success) minimizes struggle. Still, micro-choices about modulation and interference reveal a professional mindset under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear internal contradiction—his “prudently adventurous” drive versus claustrophobia—animates choices, and embodied detail (lungs protesting, breath tightening) grounds it. He acts from consistent motive (retrieve the key) and adapts tactics with the compass under pressure. The final repricing (“rebellion…against the forgetting of stories”) lands, though the realization edges toward neatness. A sharper visible cost or a moment of near‑failure would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive (rekindling empathy to surface erased victims) is clear and consistently enacted through tactile, methodical practice. The face‑blindness informs her perception and choices rather than reading as a label. Internal contradiction (refusing faces yet painting them) is present but lightly tested; the quarry’s swift “response” eases struggle and reduces felt cost. The ending registers a meaningful shift, though the price paid skews conceptual rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motive (honoring an ancestor) is clear and drives concrete choices: descend, retrieve, and ultimately protect the nail. The “nervously confident” paradox is embodied in tactile beats (trembling fingertips, spongey dread settling into resolve). Some moments tip toward emblematic assertion (moral compass talk) rather than dramatized ambiguity, and secondary relational pressure (the crew) remains offstage. Still, her micro-choices under weather pressure feel earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    A distinct, motivated POV drives the piece, with the fiddler’s vow and embodied awe (“weight of the moment settle like ash”) giving him texture. However, inner conflict is light and largely untested; he meets little resistance and pays minimal on‑page cost. The emotional palette skews to one color (“luminous disbelief”) rather than contradictions under pressure. The final renunciation (lifelong quest) is credible but only lightly earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s motives (boundary‑setting over reckless looping) are consistent and enacted through concrete choices (proposing the markers, gently dissuading Maya, returning to the train, pocketing the last note). Interiority is particular—filtered through his father’s legacy and the tactile currency—but internal contradiction is muted; his “polished calm” rarely strains against an opposing impulse. The final renunciation/reframing feels earned by prior beats. Slight safety in his perfection (rare visible flaw) limits ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s aim and temperament are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (whispering the telegram, aligning the telescope, placing the telegram) align with her belief in words and witnessing. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely struggles or hesitates—so the shift reads as smooth rather than hard-won. Embodied emotion appears (“weight settle in her chest,” scents and hums) but trends toward lyric generality over specificity under pressure. The resolution forecloses little beyond secrecy, with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear (guard and unseal the confession) and consistent with “warlike serenity,” and her micro-choices (stepping into the vortex, modulating the seed’s hunger, sealing it in the amulet) align. Internal contradiction is present but lightly dramatized; she rarely struggles on the page. Competence slightly smooths pressure, limiting felt cost. Still, actions reveal character under a coherent value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear desire and agency (she seeks and activates the covenant), with embodied affect (“anxious elation”) and tactile choices (palm to hedge, taking the clipping). Internal contradiction and felt cost are light; she meets little resistance and rarely wrestles with competing impulses. The “binding to every forgotten covenant” hints at burden but isn’t dramatized as a price. Competent, coherent, but low on struggle-driven revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maelia’s drive to mend an inner void is clear and embodied through tactile choices (sigils, soot line, placing the card). The “fiercely gentle”/reckless tension is stated and lightly felt, but her recklessness never exacts an on‑page consequence. Interiority is consistent and image‑led, though insights like “She understood then…” tilt toward telling. The final stance shift (burden lightens; resolve deepens) lands, albeit with low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear (recovering purpose after a public failure) and internal contradiction is alive: the narrator both seeks factual control and yearns toward a new stage. Embodied perception (grinders, dust, cloth) grounds emotion. The shift from shame to a quiet resolve feels earned through on‑page micro‑choices (cataloguing, wrapping the cloth, writing the ledger entry). A slight tendency toward declarative insight softens the edge of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her methodical temperament shapes her choices (tuning a branch, mapping glyphs to pulses). However, internal contradiction is muted; “haunted ambitions” are named but not dramatically tested on the page. Emotional embodiment is gentle rather than pressured, with few micro‑choices under true stress. The closing decision to leave the arbor reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied in choices (smelting the memory key, opening a shelf of blank volumes). Interiority has a specific, character‑particular texture (“gears turn slower when the light was thin”). Conflict remains mostly internal and serene, with limited on‑page resistance or cost. The final renunciation/shift (allowing his identity to migrate) is credible but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive is clear and credible, and her micro‑choices (opening the shell, reading, lifting, whispering, placing) track a purposeful progression. The internal contradiction—procedural inspector vs. emergent keeper of light—registers, though it stays gentle rather than pressurized. Embodiment is present (trembling fingers, cool mist), avoiding therapy‑speak. The final renunciation of her old role lands but could show a sharper cost or resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation (seek self‑forgiveness) is clear and embodied through specific, character‑particular actions (following graffiti, pressing the bellows, drawing a map in mud). The “truth‑seeking river chronicler” lens feels integrated rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (methodical control vs. confessed brokenness), keeping the arc credible. A slightly greater friction between those impulses in a peak beat could have deepened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear goal and steady desire, but interior contradiction and felt cost are thin; “cautious exuberance” repeats without deepening. The veiled dreamer acts (latch, vowel) but remains largely emblematic. Micro-choices exist (documenting, anticipating reversals) yet they’re rarely pressured. The ending vow lands without a meaningful personal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—“to weigh a dream against an empire”—is concrete and consistently pressures her choices, and her embodied “mulberry ache” gives the interiority specificity. Micro‑choices (aligning the violin with coffee rings, choosing to propagate the vines’ dissent) reveal values under stress. However, internal contradiction is lightly rendered and the envoy’s swift capitulation reduces the felt struggle and cost at her decisive moment. The grief-toned endurance is credible but the emotional price is more told than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motive and embodied ritual detail anchor her, but she faces little friction or contradiction on the page. Competence dominates; we rarely see a competing impulse or fear complicate the act. The “covenant” realization reads more declarative than earned through struggle. Still, her tactile choices (listening, tracing, placing) align with her role and aim.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motives and temperament are clear and consistent, and small micro‑choices (aligning the hairpin, guiding workers) reveal her values. However, internal conflict is largely pre‑solved (“after forgiving the unforgivable”), reducing on‑page struggle. The epiphany (“contentment was not a hidden treasure…”) reads a touch tidy. Embodied emotion is present but rarely contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives are clear and character‑particular: she’s a “conscience for hire,” sincerely insincere, who chooses to risk softening a rigid decree. Her micro‑choices (lifting the shard, promising the wind, unhooking the knot) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on protecting nuance. Interiority is embodied through tools and setting rather than therapy‑speak. The primary weakness is low counter‑pressure; struggle and visible cost remain largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her choice to withhold perception under pressure fits her reverse-aging paradox. Interiority leans lyrical rather than conflicted, keeping tension gentle rather than acute. Micro‑choices (stone drop, reading rings, entering the grotto) align with her goal. The final acceptance feels earned but the emotional cost remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (to navigate without moving) and embodied attention to tools and environment anchor her interiority. The reverent, ritualistic stance feels particular, though internal contradiction is minimal and she meets little genuine resistance. The small renunciation—choosing understanding over motion—reads as an earned stasis. A touch more friction or self‑doubt under pressure would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selric’s motive—seeking the sacred in the simple against a culture of automation—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (unstrap, mist walk, touch the keystone) align with that aim. Interiority is present and character‑particular, with a gentle contradiction (yearning for purpose vs. fear of underachievement). However, pressure is soft, and the transformation happens with minimal resistance, dulling the felt cost. The earned shift reads credible but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Eli’s vow to “discover the color of sound” drives every choice. Interiority is lyrical and particular, with tactile embodiments like “ink and old tide,” but the piece lacks contradictory impulses or meaningful hesitation under pressure. Actions align cleanly with motives, sometimes too cleanly for felt struggle. The ending reflects an earned endurance rather than a hard-won change, with minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s desire “to wavelength align with purpose” is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (decoding, turning the last coin). His interiority mixes doubt and conviction in a character‑specific way without therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction is present but mild; stakes remain largely conceptual. The shift at the end reads earned, though the felt cost is subtle rather than biting.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: Lira seeks to name nameless fears and relieve ancestral grief. Interiority is embodied through tactile interactions with the page, crystals, and light, though resistance is minimal and the process feels relatively frictionless. The ache over a half‑remembered sailor adds specificity. The final release reads earned but not hard‑won, keeping this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mage’s motivation (to right a cosmic imbalance) is clear and embodied in patient, task‑level choices (measuring drips, warming fissures). His contradictions—lukewarm power vs brittle devotion—are present but not tested to breaking; struggle skews contemplative rather than pressured. The closing self‑reassessment (“even a brittle devotion…”) feels slightly tidy but earned. Emotional texture is present, if understated, through tactile ritual rather than conflict with another will.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motive (expunge a harmful myth) and steady competence carry the piece, but internal contradiction and visible struggle are minimal, keeping her arc relatively frictionless. The “precisely humane” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice. Micro‑choices (following photographs, placing the label) reveal values but rarely force trade‑offs. The communal address hints at emotional cost, yet Caitlyn never risks much beyond poise.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selene’s motive—binding logic to intuition—is consistent and drives her choices (lighting the sapphire flame, channeling starlings, risking the crystal’s detonation). The interior contradiction (scholarly rigor vs. secret sentimentality) is present and embodied, especially when the shards trigger a childhood-tinted surge. Agency is steady, though the cost of her choice skews conceptual more than felt. A clearer moment of jeopardy or renunciation would deepen the change’s price.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation—preserve trust despite the “watcher’s burden”—is enacted through concrete micro-choices (climbing higher, revising the harness, descending). Embodied detail (knot‑work, the buckle’s bite) grounds emotion. Internal contradiction is light; he’s highly competent with little visible falter, so struggle costs read muted. The grief echo via the fallen skyfarer adds depth but stops short of a sharper, in‑scene conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation (defeat numbness by vivifying the Duplicate) is clear and drives his action, and the paradox blade embodies a credible internal contradiction. Interiority lands through sensory beats (numbness cracking like ice) rather than labels. However, resistance from the factions collapses too fast, softening the pressure on his choice and the felt cost. The relationship dynamics with Guardians/Syndicate remain schematic rather than crucible‑like.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motive (to build a living puzzle and “safeguard space for innovation”) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (placing the seed, designing vents, tying riddles to airflow) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she moves from curiosity to execution without resistance or contradictory impulses. The awe at the bloom lands, but the character cost remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lone conductor’s motive (restore laughter) is clear and embodied; “mournfully eager” gives him a credible contradiction. His micro-choices (waiting for the hourglass, pulling the cord, shifting from vortex to lullaby) align with this drive. Cost is felt but modest (tears, acceptance that “true haunting” remains). Interiority is largely lyric rather than decision-calibrated, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (homesick guardian yearning to “make friends with uncertainty”) and embodied responses (cautious approach to the pendant) carry the piece. Internal contradiction (feral protector vs. curator-in-waiting) is present but the cost of the turn remains soft. Micro-choices—approach, reverence instead of aggression, choosing to wait—align with character. The shift to “curator” is credible but edges toward declarative rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation and method are clear and consistent—revive the crozier to crack his “crystal cage”—and the micro‑choices around tinkering track. However, internal contradiction is light; “stoically sensitive” reads more as a stance than a pressure that forces a costly trade‑off. Emotional embodiment is strong in image but thin in conflicted impulse. The ending shift (hopelessness lifting) is earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    Selin’s competence and intention are clear, and her actions track her worldview, but internal conflict is minimal and largely untested. The “scholars insist” pressure stays abstract, so contradictions in her motives never bite on the page. Her micro‑choices (climb, insert shard, calibrate, broadcast) are purposeful yet emotionally frictionless. The ending’s acceptance costs her little beyond effort, softening character change.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lio’s desire “to merge parallel timelines” is clear and consistently enacted via the radio and hourglass. Interiority is largely declarative and idealized; we don’t see contradictory impulses tested on the page. His resilient optimism never meets friction that would force a costed choice. The closing acceptance feels earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (to discover “the texture of connection”), and actions align (weaving, crossing the bridge). However, interior conflict is muted; the “unsettling calm” blunts urgency and we see few contradictory impulses. Emotional embodiment is largely externalized into the environment, leaving the protagonist’s inner struggle abstract. The closing acceptance reads earned but carries limited personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive—learning to navigate by starlight—threads the piece and informs her choices (adopting “edge geometry,” returning the chain link). Interiority is present in a measured, character‑specific register (“balancedly curious”), but real internal contradiction under pressure is light. The test vessel’s success arrives with little friction, so we learn less about her limits or blind spots. The closing renunciation/promise feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—protecting “vulnerable voices” drives every move—and embodied through tactile choices (tuning the scanner, entering the alcove). Internal contradiction is limited; the protagonist rarely hesitates, so pressure doesn’t expose competing impulses. Still, the acceptance of “weight” at the end reads as a credible, modest cost. The voice-specific occupational lens (“contact tracer for hearts”) adds texture to action rather than remaining a label.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobia versus the codex’s pull—are embodied (shallow breath, tactile fear) and carried to a quiet renunciation at the end. Motivation is consistent and clean: to stand by the unremembered, dramatized by aligning the codex and later burying it. The internal struggle could tighten under peak pressure (the phase jump succeeds without a stutter), slightly softening cost. Still, actions align with motives and reveal character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s motive (undo the bureaucratic death and prevent the ghost from overwriting her mind) is clear and her actions track, but internal contradiction and visible cost are limited. She operates with calm competence; anxiety and doubt rarely trouble her choices. The shard‑as‑memento at the end suggests a modest renunciation of fear rather than a pressured trade. Strong specificity, light struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he aims to “translate texture into sound” before a language dies—and his actions align. Interiority is mostly externalized through ritualized choices rather than conflicted impulses; struggle feels smooth. The acceptance that the language will be locked in the tunnel gives a modest cost at the end. A sharper internal contradiction under pressure would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s motive (coax the beast’s sorrow into laughter) is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (placing the arrowhead, engaging the phone). Interiority is vivid but largely linear; contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, skepticism vs. wonder) are mostly implied rather than pressed. The cost—the loss of the arrowhead and a relinquished bitterness—lands but with minimal friction. Strong specificity of role (cryptid researcher undercover) adds credibility, though struggle feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (reawaken beauty), and actions align, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely emblematic rather than psychologically particular. The closest pressure from another character is the bronze statue’s demand, which resolves quickly without testing his limits beyond a single defiant note. Embodied emotion leans mythic over specific, so cost reads conceptual more than felt. The final vow functions, but the personal price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo’s motive—to broker peace across a contested border—drives concrete micro-choices (deploying the bottled storm, slipping the envelope). The “respectfully rebellious” contradiction reads on the page and informs his risk calculus. Interiority leans abstract at times (“He knew that broken promises…”) but his embodied acts keep him specific. The cost to him remains soft but his endurance and restraint feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motive—translating silence into motion—is clear and consistent, and her actions (repairing, singing, descending) align with it. However, interior contradiction and felt cost are minimal; she meets little resistance, so we learn little beyond competence and devotion. The line “She understood…” repeats a thesis rather than dramatizing a hard-won shift. Character reads vivid but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (tracing lines, whispering the algorithm, adjusting/tucking the scarf) align with her stewardship. Interiority is restrained but credible; we feel her calm vigilance more than inner contradiction. The piece lacks a vivid internal counter-impulse or cost that would deepen character under pressure. Still, her competence and quiet duty read as particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, particular motivation (recover the runaway dream) and consistent actions (dawn climbs, camera work, whispering the cipher) ground Mara. However, interior contradiction is light; she rarely faces competing impulses under pressure. The brief Lio shard adds an external echo rather than a crucible. The closing acceptance (“not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge”) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he comes to free an idea—but interior conflict is thin and largely untested. Micro‑choices exist (follow the star, test the groove, leave the lock), yet few reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotions skew abstract (“improbable longing”) over embodied specificity. The change at the end feels earned but low‑cost, more affirmation than reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear drive (recover the village’s memories) and embodied perception anchor her, but internal contradiction is minimal and she meets little resistance. Competence dominates—she reads wreck‑constellations, finds the sextant, aligns the ring—without a meaningful cost to complicate her choices. The curiosity trait motivates action credibly. A stronger felt trade‑off at the peak would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation (“mentor resilience quietly”) is clear and drives concrete choices (annotation, tea‑geometry decoding, protection of texts). Contradictory impulses—nervous backward walking vs. “combative tenderness”—surface in scene and modulate behavior. The steadying of her steps as confidence replaces retreat reads as an earned micro‑change. Slight limitation: internal conflict is gently tested, not truly cornered.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he vows to preserve “the color of wonder” and makes choices (cracking the seed’s potential, singing the storm, gifting the sprig) aligned with it. Interiority remains mostly reverent and steady, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Emotional embodiment appears in tactile actions (kneeling, lifting, setting the seed) rather than abstract label-speak. The absence of a felt cost or conflicted hesitation keeps the character arc from deepening into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and specific—she was summoned to ground restless spirits—and her tactics (unraveling knots, returning fragments to masks) align. Interiority is present but largely in service of ritual rather than conflicted psychology; contradictory impulses rarely surface. The felt cost is modest (taking on the “weight” of hush), yet the closing resolve reads earned. A deeper on‑page struggle or friction would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“interpret silence with empathy”) drives concrete actions (projector setup, map overlay). The interior contradiction—“shielded openness” versus potential overwhelm—adds nuance but the felt cost remains modest. Micro‑choices (pausing frames, aligning raindrops) reveal value hierarchy credibly. A deeper, riskier emotional or ethical trade‑off would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mort’s motive (recover the last transmission; understand “the physics of letting go”) is clear and his actions align (untangling, listening, sealing, leaving a note). Interiority is textured and embodied through tactile tasks (filaments, wax, the globe) rather than label‑speak. The internal shift to release is earned, though contradictory impulses under pressure are muted, with little on‑page friction beyond elegiac contemplation. The cost is modest but present in the shattering globe and the renunciatory departure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—he aims to articulate unspoken needs—and his choices (pressing blossoms, embedding the imprint, finally encoding his own longing) align. Interiority is mostly implied through action and image; contradictory impulses and felt cost are subtle rather than dramatized. The final act of giving his own longing to the press suggests a price but isn’t deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he seeks “the joy beneath anguish”—and his actions align (goggles → diary → descent → jars). However, internal conflict is minimal; he meets no meaningful resistance and exhibits little contradictory impulse beyond “affectionate detachment.” Interiority skews declarative and emblematic rather than character‑particular under pressure. The final renunciation (returning the goggles) is graceful but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aria’s motive—to memorialize and “prove empty spaces remember”—is clear and consistently enacted through her categorizing, inscribing, and vigil. Interiority is specific to her craft and tools, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely faces a fraught, value‑testing decision. The grief is embodied in tactile acts (engraving the brass, steadying in the swaying gondola) rather than therapy‑speak. The final acceptance—lowering the telescope and departing—reads as a quiet endurance with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motivation (to “mirror the sky”) drives concrete choices under a ticking clock. Interiority is sensorial and idiosyncratic (face blindness reframed as “rhythm of light”), with craft acting as character. The defiance of silence at the end feels earned by the preceding ritual. Minor softening from a slightly declarative insight (“the true craft…”), but it’s supported by action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lira’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (tracing diagonals, whispering phrases, chalking routes) align with her “diligently curious” nature. Interiority is present but mostly descriptive; there’s little contradictory impulse beyond a generalized caution about not draining the ship. Emotional embodiment shows in small beats (anticipation, pride) but lacks pressure that would expose a deeper flaw. The ending change reads as competence affirmed rather than an earned renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clear motive (“to learn the rhythm of repair”) and several micro-choices (following the glow, uncapping the box, whispering the prophecy, placing the gear) track cleanly. Interiority is textured but largely tonal; contradictory impulses and real internal friction are minimal. Embodied feeling appears (“breath as heavy as fog,” “heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia”) but the emotional cost remains soft. The ending suggests endurance/mission more than a conflicted renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Liora’s motive (to gather the community and reorient sharing) is clear and consistent, but her interiority is thin—“a strange surge of trust” is the lone flicker of conflict. The villagers read as a chorus, with Old Mara and the child offering texture but little pressure. Actions align with motives, yet few micro-choices under strain reveal hierarchy of values. The ending’s vow carries minimal felt cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—fulfill the sailor’s charge and pause the world—embodied in tactile choices (placing the puppet head, turning the dial, whispering). Interiority is sensorial but low on contradiction; she rarely struggles beyond tremor and “bruised awe,” so the final renunciation/endurance cost feels mostly conceptual. The mirroring with the puppet (beautifully flawed) adds a credible internal shift. Strong, if a touch untested by opposing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (a reluctant caretaker honoring a bargain to guide travelers) and embodied emotion (“bitter sweetness that settles like ash”) give specificity. The internal contradiction—reluctance versus duty—threads choices from assembling clues to placing the nut. Micro‑choices under pressure are present (timing against frost, methodical reed work, the final placement, and retreat). Slight distance from deeper personal cost (beyond duty and ash) keeps it shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s drive to atone is clear and acts consistently on the page, with embodied perception (foam, wind-as-score) grounding emotion. Internal contradiction is modest; she fears leaving the lab but encounters little resistance once she commits. Micro-choices—kneeling to trace foam, weaving reeds, bringing the bridge back—track with motive. The change reads earned but relatively low-cost, tilting toward a graceful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The vendor’s motive is clear and consistent, and his ritualistic choices (placing the bottle, counting voids, incising) track with that aim. However, interiority is thin and largely declarative; we get little contradictory impulse or embodied cost beyond awe and fulfillment. The child’s arrival adds tenderness but little pressure or friction. The final realization (“the place where stories begin…”) reads more as serene completion than earned renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lir’s motive—“to sandpaper rough memories”—is clear and embodied through tasting and ritual motion, with tactile costs as the remorse spreads. Interiority is sensory‑particular (burnt cumin, citrus) rather than label‑speak. The internal contradiction (risking spread to heal) is present but could press him harder into a sharper trade‑off or visible self‑doubt. Agency drives the outcome through iterative tasting and calibrating, earning the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is crystalline—she aims to heal the city by bridging silos—and her actions align (retrieving the weight, conducting, directing workers). Interiority remains largely steady and idealized; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal. “Empathetically decisive” is enacted more than examined, limiting complexity. The final endurance/renunciation cost is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and particular, and her actions align consistently with a mind that marries logic and wonder. Interiority is vivid but skews declarative (“She realized…”) rather than dramatizing contradiction at peak moments. The shift from cataloging to reviving is credible yet lightly costed. We miss a sharper internal conflict under pressure to elevate this to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent—she seeks forgotten combinations for the archive—but her path is largely frictionless. Interiority leans on recurring abstractions (“latent blaze,” “seeds of vigilance”) rather than contradictory impulses in the moment. We see competence and resolve, but few micro‑choices under pressure beyond “go now” and “align the symbols.” The end registers a change (latent blaze to open flame) without a palpable on‑page cost to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to make music in a silent world) drives every choice, and embodied actions (placing the reed, strumming through fissures) reveal him. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond effort. The hedgehog and owls react, but no relational pressure complicates his stance. The ending renunciation/cost is soft, more communal release than sacrificed path.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tutor’s motive—repair the eclipsed covenant by translating cosmic silence into chess—reads clear and character‑particular. Interiority is embodied through tactile beats (the warming, humming stone) and the chess‑sky mapping. Contradictory impulses (shame of exile vs. hope for renewal) are present but lightly contested rather than forcefully in conflict. The final stance shift feels earned, though the on‑page cost remains primarily emotional and subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear (recover the diary’s contents through compassionate listening) and actions align with it, with embodied perceptions (vibrations as copper, lavender, parchment). However, internal conflict is minimal; he meets little resistance and rarely reveals contradictory impulses under pressure. The vow to teach others feels earned but low-cost. Overall specific but emotionally safe characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s goal and temperament are clear (ambitious herbalist seeking serenity), and her micro-choices—slipping the seed into her satchel, planting it, journaling, and whispering to the soil—track coherently. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific through scent. However, internal conflict is minimal and largely untested; she faces little resistance or contradictory impulse on the page. The final acceptance costs her little beyond patience and an overwhelming scent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira’s goal is clear and her actions align, with a small but credible cost when she relinquishes the artifact. Interiority is present yet thin—she encounters little friction or contradictory impulse, which flattens pressure. Competence dominates over struggle, reducing the sense of earned change. The closing renunciation is sound but lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, competence‑forward motivation and tactically grounded actions (mapping, measuring, heading for the tower) read true. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely errs or wrestles with competing impulses. The “weight of responsibility” lands late without a visible cost earlier to earn it. Strong object reactions (patch, anemometer) reveal method more than psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clear motive (to “certify wonder as essential”) and a few micro‑choices (unwrap, sing, re‑stow, depart) ground her, but internal contradiction and felt cost are minimal. Interiority is largely lyrical description rather than pressured decision. The bell ringer’s competence is assured; struggle or trade‑off never meaningfully tests her values. Earned change reads more as affirmed identity than altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motive is clear and consistent—she seeks lessons from failure—and her choices (marking driftwood, playing the flute, entering/exiting the seam) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a visible emotional price beyond stated resolve. The interiority is evocative but largely declarative about mission rather than dramatizing conflict under pressure. The final vow reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motive—decoding the “mathematics of emotion”—is clear and consistently embodied in choices (printing the ambiguous line, pressing ink to the halo, mapping feelings to intervals). The interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; contradictory impulses are implied (self-dissolution vs. control) rather than dramatized in a pressured beat. The earned shift is her acceptance of ongoing self-disorientation, with a conceptual cost of eroding boundaries. A sharper on‑page tug between fear and pursuit would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courier’s motive—coaxing wonder, honoring an absent mentor—is clear and consistent, with tactile tells (jittery hands, pulse‑synced pendant). Interiority is modest but specific, avoiding stock labels. However, internal contradiction and cost are underplayed; he rarely struggles or pays a price for his choices. The encounters succeed too smoothly to expose deeper flaws or force a real trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s goal and interior tension (empirical rigor versus mystic openness) are clear and embodied in specific actions—aligning facets, chanting paradox, choosing to commune rather than touch. Her micro-choices advance the scene and culminate in a vow with conceptual cost. However, resistance is minimal; the test succeeds on first attempt, giving her little struggle to expose deeper contradiction. The felt responsibility at the end partially compensates for the ease.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (to send a message with cost) is clear, and her actions (assembling edges, placing the bead) align. The interiority is lyrical but somewhat generalized; “latent sacrifice” lands conceptually rather than through embodied contradiction. We get hints of acceptance vs. attachment, but few micro-choices under live pressure. Still, the renunciation at the end reads earned for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blacksmith’s motives are clear and consistent—seek the silk to transform failure into resilience—and his choices (bartering a memory, forging a rebuilding blade) align. Interiority is present but safe; “between understanding and confusion” hints at contradiction without pressing it into sharper, scene-bound conflict. The cost (surrendered first-failure memory) lands but feels modest. Strong, if not deeply conflicted, characterization for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Lira seeks the withheld truth and then chooses to free the crew. The interiority is distinctive but skews declarative and assured, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Her competence faces minimal friction, which softens felt cost. Still, choices align with motive and reveal character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek’s motive—to bottle and protect a feeling of safety—drives concrete micro-choices (carving “home,” nesting the glass, forming the spiral). Interiority is particular and sensorial rather than summarized. However, internal contradiction is minimal; there’s little cost or competing impulse on the page beyond quiet dread. Strong specificity without a true crucible limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira’s motive (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) is clear and enacted, but interior contradiction is thin and mostly asserted rather than dramatized. Her urgency after the “Accidentally prophetic” symbols adds one credible micro‑choice (“We must act now”), yet cost and internal friction stay abstract. The storm herald functions as a catalytic partner with little pressure or distinct agency beyond tonal counterpoint. Emotional embodiment skews to lyric image over lived bodily stress.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks why some people “magnetize stories”—and her choices (reading the scroll, following the illuminated path, placing the wing on the loom) align. Interiority is mostly conveyed through image rather than contradiction; we don’t feel much ambivalence or cost beyond a solemn vow. Her donor heart as an enabling trait reads strong but doesn’t pressure her with competing impulses. The final pledge suggests endurance more than a fraught decision.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s motive—unspooling the echo‑grid and translating the oak’s witness—is clear and consistent, and his tactile choices with the sextant align with it. Interiority is specific (pulse through brass, groaning floorboards) but largely harmonious; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Competence dominates struggle, so change arrives with limited felt cost. The final easing reads earned, but the internal conflict stays gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s motive—rekindle a dying realm—is clear and her agency (singing, raising arms, pledging lifelong guardianship) is consistent, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Emotions are filtered through sweeping imagery more than embodied specifics, so cost reads conceptual. The final renunciation (to guard forever) registers, yet its sacrifice isn’t felt through tangible loss or resisted impulse. Overall credible but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and continuous: he seeks wisdom from a past abandonment, and the “staying while leaving” tension reads as a live, contradictory impulse. The interiority is largely embodied through tactile anchors (attic creaks, candle, hatch) though it leans abstract at times (“nested paradoxes” repeats as label). His admission of error as key feels earned by prior beats. The cost is present but soft—more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s motive—to find the sacred in the ordinary—reads coherent and character‑particular, and his micro‑choices (recovering the loaf, making it an altar, offering a piece to an empty chair) align with that motive. However, internal contradiction and pressure are light; the piece rarely forces him to choose between competing values. The “tenuous absolution” he senses is moving but not earned through conflicted struggle on the page. Emotional embodiment is largely atmospheric rather than viscerally felt in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation and a distinct, competence-forward temperament anchor the chief; her gently meticulous habits drive the method. Interiority is textured through action (measuring, recording) more than introspective contradiction, leaving conflict relatively serene. The felt cost is subtle—weight settling on her shoulders—credible but not searing. Strong presence, modest ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lila’s motives (protect the truce; haunted by “the sound of trust breaking”) are specific and consistent, and her micro‑choices under pressure (decoy vapor; rope‑and‑toss of the lanterns; reporting to elders) align with them. The internal contradiction—comforting unease vs. steadfast action—surfaces without therapy‑speak. Cost is legible in her choice to cast the lanterns into darkness, trading safety for time. Relationship pressure is mostly off‑stage (Marrow, father), limiting crucible intensity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin’s motive—skepticism straining toward understanding—drives concrete micro‑choices (tasting, calibrating, pressing the ring to his tongue) and culminates in a believable soft reorientation. The internal contradiction (luminous skeptic vs. emergent wonder) is present though not deeply embattled. Emotional embodiment is specific (taste, metal, wind) rather than label‑only. The cost is conceptual rather than felt, keeping this short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s motive—to rectify fractured inspiration—reads clear and steady, and her micro‑choices (prepping the mirror, aligning light, taking the final stroke) align. Interiority is image‑driven and particular, though inner contradiction is faint; compulsion outweighs conflict. The guardian’s silent pressure serves as a mirror rather than a foil, keeping the focus on her agency. The change at the end (unlocked, ink‑charged, vow renewed) is earned but pays a small emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“candor in small moments”) drives tangible choices from refusing the council to assembling the map and speaking truth. Interiority is lyrically filtered through work and objects rather than deeply conflicted thought; contradiction is minimal. Agency is steady and credible, but the emotional cost of defiance is sensed more conceptually than felt in‑body. The earned shift at the end reads as commitment affirmed rather than a fraught transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he labors to preserve “the color of wonder”—but interior contradiction or on‑page dilemma is minimal. We see steady tending (tightening copper joints) rather than pressured micro‑choices that reveal competing impulses. The neighbors and gulls function as chorus, not crucible. The endurance at the end reads credible but low‑cost for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vira’s motivation—to quell “inner static” while protecting the farm—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (turning to the box, initiating a controlled burn). Interiority is particular to an android sensibility (“sensors tasting ozone”), though contradiction under pressure remains mild and the path to success feels relatively smooth. The final renunciation of perpetual vigilance lands but carries limited on‑page cost. Strong specificity, slightly low friction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motive (“to prove that listening heals”) is clear and steady, and her choices—curating, placing the locket on the bench, assembling an exhibit, guiding the child—align. Interiority is present but largely serene; there’s little contradictory impulse or felt risk. The lack of real friction or ethically costly trade-offs limits depth. Still, actions reveal a coherent, empathetic character under a gentle kind of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Selene’s motive—to encode vulnerability into strength—is clear, but interior contradiction and embodied cost are lightly sketched. She moves with mastery and little struggle; choices rarely reveal competing impulses. The crystal’s rescue and departure land emotionally yet without a felt sacrifice. Overall, vivid persona, limited pressure on her psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—recovering “deleted memories”—is clear and consistently pursued, and her micro‑choices (entering the chamber, exhuming sand, pressing the flower) align with it. Interiority is textured through sensory attention (salt, tugging gravity), though conflicting impulses are muted; she rarely hesitates or pays an evident emotional price beyond reverent awe. The closing acceptance reads as earned but gentle rather than hard‑won. A stronger moment of doubt or cost under pressure would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—she comes to hush a coded prophecy—but interior contradiction is minimal and stress scarcely degrades perception. Micro‑choices (aligning the wing with the brook, breath control) reveal focus but not conflict. Emotional texture is mostly awe and purpose, with little visible cost. The endurance at the end feels earned but risk‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear desire (learn stone’s language) and a credible mask (the “agreed upon lies”) give the narrator specificity, and Liora’s poised competence contrasts nicely. Internal tension—curiosity vs. secrecy—registers but never bites hard enough to force a costly choice. Micro‑choices (borrowing sugar; accepting weekly sessions) reveal values but at low consequence. The relationship gains texture, yet pressure never forces either to expose or renounce the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s motivation—to transmute isolation into independence via an archive—is clear and consistent, and her key actions (pressing the shell, recording, lifting it to dawn) align. However, interior conflict is mostly stated rather than dramatized; her “charmed skeptic” quality seldom complicates choices. The transformation lands, but the cost is gentle and not contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular—she forges to “forgive the unfinished”—and her micro‑choices (using the thorn as balm, tuning verses to water) align. However, internal contradiction is mild; she meets little resistance, so the change feels more affirmation than hard‑won shift. The cost (relinquishing the weight of treason; letting the key melt) is felt but soft. Strong specificity in craft details grounds her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—she seeks why echoes persist and acts on that through listening, entering the cavern, and the shell‑joining choice. Interiority is sensorially specific and character‑particular (“subtle syncopation,” “stone spiral” chimes). However, contradiction is minimal; she rarely faces competing impulses, which flattens pressure. The felt cost is gentle (quiet ache, burden to carry knowledge), credible but not deeply testing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks to salvage purity—but interior contradiction is minimal, leaving little friction under pressure. Micro‑choices (mapping dreams, whispering into the globe, embedding a cameo) align with motive but don’t reveal competing impulses. Emotions are embodied via tactile images (cold melting into her skin), yet the character remains archetypal. The final stance shift feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (to perceive and honor hidden effort), and he makes small, coherent choices (whistling, tracing the whisk, following moon paths). Interiority is image‑driven but light on genuine contradiction or cost; we don’t see impulses in tension. The “resolve to mend a torn strand of his own memory” hints at change but remains abstract. Emotional embodiment skews ritualistic rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her competence reads credibly in the letter‑reassembly scene. However, internal contradiction and embodied pressure are thin; she encounters little resistance and pays little visible cost. The “responsibility” note at the end gestures toward consequence without dramatizing it. Strong function, limited depth.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he aims to “shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—and he makes concrete choices (mirrors, coils, drones). However, interiority skews abstract, with little contradictory impulse or embodied cost. The rallying of clans and commissioning of drones happen smoothly, limiting felt struggle. The final stance feels earned conceptually but not paid for emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—he seeks redemption by translating ancestral music for the living—and actions align (lifting the box, bottling sounds, offering a jar to the child). Interiority is lyrical and particular, but the character skews saintly with little contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices exist yet carry limited cost beyond relinquishing solitude. The late scene with the child hints at change but doesn’t surface a sharper inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s “logically emotional” mind is embodied in concrete choices—spectrometer readings alongside heartbeat matching—giving her competence texture. The internal contradiction (math vs. music) is present but lightly tested; she succeeds without much degradation or error under pressure. Her motive to protect and calibrate for healing reads consistent and active. The felt cost is mostly a tear and acceptance of stewardship, credible but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to “sculpt patience from impatience”—is clear and consistently embodied in choices (waiting, tracking, aligning the compass). Interiority is specific and textured through sensory data rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (restrained wildness vs. calm purpose) are present but lightly dramatized. The change at the end reads earned, though the cost remains subtle and interior rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (preventable deaths, breaking control) and a competent, tactile method ground Mara. The mentor memory hints at a values conflict (data vs. fear systems), but the scene seldom pressures her into a costly contradiction. Turning the valve is motivated and aligned with her traits, though the price paid is minimal. Interiority is specific and embodied, if occasionally abstracted by label-phrases (“fortified vulnerability”).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (seeking a redemptive act) with embodied choices (kneeling, tracing filigree, slow insertion of the rod). The chaplain’s moral hesitation is present but lightly contested, leaning toward tidy resolution. The shopkeeper adds real pressure with the “fresh spring” call. Emotional texture is specific, though contradictions are gentle rather than truly riven.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—curiosity fused with the algorithm’s longing—is clear and consistently enacted (steering in, transliterating, ringing). Interiority is textured via jokes and perception filters (the “coffee” quip; poet‑reading‑glass line), but contradictory impulses under pressure are faint. She faces little genuine risk or sacrifice; the cost of her prank on fate is mostly conceptual. The final recommitment (installing the prism, pressing onward) reads as earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lia’s motivation is clear and sustained—an archivist compelled by absence—but her internal conflict is light; the ethical cost of “lying” is noted but not deeply felt. Her micro-choices (fabricating the post, following the sublayer, recognizing the checksum) align with her competence and personality. Emotional embodiment is mostly atmospheric rather than contradictory under pressure. The closing vow reads earned, though the price paid remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear (answering the shard’s call, “map empathy onto action”), and micro‑choices (seeking the van, using mirrors, aligning shards) align with her calmly intuitive nature. However, internal contradiction is minimal and she encounters little resistance, so change costs feel soft. The character reads specific and embodied, but her competence smooths over struggle. The final acceptance of listening as power lands but without a visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive and credible internal conflict: a euthanasia tourist drawn into relief work, listening for “the sound of endings.” Embodied perception (ice, wind, parasol tip) grounds emotion. The decisive internal shift—reframing the trip from seeking death to seeking solace—feels earned, if a touch over‑articulated. Slightly heavy declaratives curb the complexity of the ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to bridge “fire and earth” by tending the letter and the vines—and his actions (planting, letting the scrap dissolve) align. Interiority is concrete via sensory vineyard detail, though conflict remains mostly internal and gently pressured. Contradictory impulses (attachment to the relic vs. letting it go) are present but softly rendered. The final renunciation feels earned with a modest, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Keeper’s motive—preserving the echo of wisdom—drives discernible choices (consecration, listening, explaining, departing). Interiority is present but remains stylized rather than deeply conflicted, with little on‑page contradiction under pressure. The prophet and villagers apply only soft pressure, so relational dynamics never truly test him. The ending renunciation/devotion reads credible, if low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motive—collective healing through archival craft—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (lingering, arranging arcs, revealing the feather) align with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely faces a competing impulse or visible doubt that would pressure those choices. Embodied emotion shows in tactile actions and environmental sensitivity, but the calm competence smooths struggle. The ending registers endurance and purpose rather than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (recording, interpreting, returning to leave a page) align with her reticence turning to resolve. Interiority is textured through sensory attention rather than labels. Internal conflict is present but gentle—less a rift than a drift—so the cost of the shift reads modest. The final offering credibly forecloses a path (print‑bound certainties) but at a soft price.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular: he seeks chalk to etch and preserve what he is losing, driven by “precognitively forgetful” visions. Interiority is tactile and embodied through sound images (cracked vinyl, tape hiss) and object work (driftwood, cassette). Micro-choices—marking the path, choosing to record, then to inscribe—align with his longing. The internal conflict is gentle rather than combative, so the cost reads more as acceptance than wrenching sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear motive and competency: he’s called to fix the impossible and commits with ritual steadiness. Interiority is conveyed through embodied craft (“hands were changelessly constant”) rather than reflection. However, contradiction is limited—he rarely falters, so the emotional cost feels gentler than the language suggests. The earned renunciation is more about endurance than a fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s care and ritualized intent are clear, but her interiority is largely unwavering and free of contradiction, leaving little sense of struggle under pressure. Micro‑choices (placing the vinyl shard, choosing a cadence) align with motive yet reveal no competing impulse or doubt. Mr. Harlan remains a receptive presence rather than an active crucible. The result is moving but emotionally smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear motivation and a consistent “quietly deliberate” temperament, but little internal contradiction or felt struggle under pressure. Lira executes a plan competently with minimal doubt or micro‑costs beyond patience. Interiority is largely procedural and descriptive, not decision‑charged. The resolution feels earned but emotionally low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s “forgiving skeptic” stance and bone‑setter competence are clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (tingling hands, coaxing vertebrae) that suits her aims. The contradiction between yearning for resolution and holding onto skepticism is present, but the cost of this balance never quite bites. Her micro‑choices—kneeling, aligning bones, deciding to keep the tooth—reveal values under pressure. However, struggle is low; success feels largely unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she aims “to share light without using fire”—and her actions (polishing, arranging, chanting) align. We glimpse a credible renunciation in “Now, anchored to earth,” hinting at the cost of giving up the star‑chasing life. However, internal contradiction is minimal and largely thematic rather than dramatized under pressure. The emotional turn lands, but the struggle toward it feels gentle and low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—to transmute her sister’s viral confession into gentler meaning—is clear and drives tangible acts (stones, pendant, interface). Interiority is embodied through sensory focus rather than label-speak, with “honeyed hush” shaping breath and choice. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she meets little inner resistance, so cost feels soft. The final realization reads earned but serenely tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (to collect and bind hopes) is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (moving against the current, recording cameos, placing the shell). The internal contradiction—calling and doubt—registers, though it remains somewhat abstract and emotionally buffered. Embodied emotion is light; we rarely feel pressure on her body or breath beyond lush atmosphere. The final stance (enduring, promising to return) is earned but not paid with a sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—to restore sacred rites—is clear and her actions (choosing the lyre, adjusting to the moon’s rhythm, accepting the vow) align. Interiority is sensorial and specific, though largely singular in direction with little contradiction or genuine doubt. The cost lands as a chosen burden rather than a contested sacrifice. Strong presence, limited struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (to seal starlight and render heartbeats as maps) and embodied practice (slow, glacier-like placements) ground her actions. Internal contradiction is light; the piece favors serenity over friction, so pressure on her values is minimal. The covenant to keep tending the seal provides an earned endurance/cost. A stronger on-page competing impulse would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    Corin’s motive—to restore the timer and “store wonder”—is clear and drives each tactic, with a late internal check about imprisoning echoes adding nuance. However, genuine struggle is minimal; competence rarely meets resistance beyond craft patience. The paradox-to-liberation realization (“not a prison but a library”) lands but at low personal cost. Interiority is specific and sensorial, though contradictions under pressure remain mild.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, singular motive (unbind the grotto’s sorrow) and consistent ritual actions, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely subsumed by the lyric rite. Embodied emotion shows through tactile ritual (tracing veins, whispering to weights) rather than explicit inner conflict. The patience/stillness constraint provides slight pressure but little visible cost. The ending’s acceptance reads earned, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—“to harvest lessons from loss”—is clear and embodied through the carving and sealing of sap. Her actions align with an internal endurance arc and culminate in an earned acceptance. Interior contradiction is subtle (reverence vs. utility) rather than deeply dramatized, keeping the pressure gentle. Still, micro‑choices (glass pressed, lantern placed, leaving the loft) reveal values credibly under quiet strain.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motives (barter regret for a glimpse of the abandoned path) are clear, embodied in concrete actions—collecting mist-stories, arranging a spiral, using the camera wheel. Her erosion vs. resolve creates credible internal contradiction, and the pact costs her—tears, relinquishing regrets into story-labor. The ghost functions as a pressured mirror rather than a prop. Minor hedge: the “chronologically confused” trait informs mood more than constraining a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Her motivation—resurrecting the terminal and reweighting it toward “hope”—is clear and consistent, and her engineering choices track. However, she meets minimal resistance; competence outweighs struggle, limiting interior contradiction. Interiority is often abstract (“ethical currents,” “maze of intentions”) rather than embodied under stress. The final stance shift reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to reclaim an abandoned, sentimental design) guides concrete choices, and the renunciation of guild standards reads credibly. Interiority is sensory and specific, avoiding therapy‑speak, with embodied actions (inscribing crystal numerals) that reveal him. The internal conflict is relatively gentle and lacks a sharp counter‑impulse on the page, so the cost feels modest. Still, the final acceptance lands as an earned endurance/renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (to parse and dismantle lies) and aligned with action (using the sundial to free the lock), but internal contradiction is minimal and stakes are largely conceptual. The seeker rarely struggles; his competence glides past real friction. Embodied emotion appears (“serene upheaval”) yet reads more labeled than dramatized. The end resolve feels earned but light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single‑POV interiority is coherent and specific—his patience, tactile decoding, and ritual use of the fulgurite reveal character through action. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or real internal friction; he’s serene and competent from start to finish. Micro‑choices (kneeling to decode, using the glass, promising a vigil) align with motive but rarely test him. The enduring stance at the end reads earned, if low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear—he maps a “geography of healing” by writing living obituaries—and his choices (kneeling, drawing the thread, projecting, placing it by the rose, departing) align. Interiority is image‑driven and particular, if somewhat one‑note in its solemnity. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. faith, grief vs. hubris) are implied but not dramatized under pressure. The endurance choice at the end is earned but the cost reads soft.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—his urge to “reawaken beauty” grows from the discovered egg to the placement beneath the stalactite. The inner contradiction (machinery upbringing vs. feather‑listening) is present, if articulated more lyrically than dramatized. Micro‑choices (salvaging gears, choosing the water‑drip site) align with his values under pressure. The final change feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motive—to transmute a fraught legacy into service—is clear and embodied in the ritual graft. Interiority is specific (boots in black sand, coin’s tone answering her) but conflict remains largely serene; contradictory impulses don’t press her into a difficult trade‑off. The villagers’ presence provides external pressure only as affirmation, not friction. The final lift of lineage reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive (liberate memories) is clear and consistent, and micro‑choices (tracing symbols, whispering names, the patient twist) align with her luminous skepticism. The interior contradiction—skepticism softened by belief—registers but remains gentle. Pressure rarely forces a painful trade‑off; the box resists, but she succeeds without visible sacrifice. Still, her embodied attention and ritual actions reveal character credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she vows to “share light without using fire” and makes concrete choices (aligns the gear, releases pulses, plants it). Interiority is lyric but thin on contradictory impulses; she “presses on” after seeing war‑shadows, yet the struggle remains largely conceptual. Embodied emotion comes through image rather than felt bodily stress. The renunciation of fire carries cost, but it is elegiac rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear—Eliam seeks the “shape of collective grief”—and his actions (bringing the ribbon, tracing butterfly paths, carving the monument) align. Interiority is textured but largely serene; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, so the arc reads more devotional than conflicted. Mara provides gentle pressure rather than friction, keeping choices low-stakes. The closing endurance—devoting his craft to a communal language—feels earned, if not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—“incremental absolution” through repair—is clear and consistently enacted, with tactile choices (timing the pause, aligning inscriptions). However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or suffers visible doubt. The endurance cost is stated (“the work would never end”) but lightly felt in-scene. Strong embodiment via the tool and setting partly compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he seeks the “shape of intentions”—and his choices (opening the case, decoding the tapestry, pocketing the map) align. Interiority is sensorially embodied, but internal conflict is minimal; he faces little resistance or contradiction. The blitheness paired with ritual gravity is interesting, yet the cost of carrying remembrance is only lightly felt. The ending registers an earned stance, but with modest pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear motive (“to seed innovation within a constraint”) and consistent competence, but interiority is largely summarized; few embodied moments or micro‑choices under pressure. Skepticism from scholars appears but doesn’t force visible inner conflict. The closing humility beat lands, yet the shift feels declarative rather than earned through on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—“to teach dust to tell stories”—is clear and consistently enacted via specific micro‑choices (tuning the dial, donning the shawl, transcribing, pressing play). Interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted; contradictory impulses are muted, so pressure on her psyche feels low. Actions align with her vocation and worldview in satisfying ways. The ending delivers quiet pride rather than a hard cost, which limits depth of character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is legible (to crystallize a fleeting emotion) and embodied in tactile choices with the powder and mask, but internal contradiction is light; she seldom wavers. The “mirage of safety” tempts, yet she never seriously considers opting out, which softens pressure. Embodied sensations (the crystalline chill, weight of unfinished stories) land. The explicit thesis-like line near the end edges toward tidy clarity rather than earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (preserving/decoding waterworks) and a credible contradiction (“rationally rebellious”) drive a choice to reconcile narratives. Interiority is specific to vocation (reading silt layers, ciphering) and reacts to objects (the cog). The emotional cost of renouncing a single truth is present but lightly felt and mostly conceptual. No on‑page interpersonal pressure slightly limits depth of conflict expression.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    The teacher’s motive—braiding diverse voices—guides clear, purposeful choices (playing the zither, inviting the child and veteran). Interiority is present but relatively saintly; contradictions and cost remain soft. Embodied emotion lands in tactile cues (dust settling, shoulders loosening), though conflict within her is minimal. The change is credible but gentle, more endurance than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, expressed through tactile choices (the broth, the whispering, the planting). Interiority arrives via sensory specificity (“tasting memories”) rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are minimal; she meets little resistance and rarely doubts. The arc reads as competent enactment more than pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—to preserve wonder—guides concrete choices (opening the box, reading the riddle, turning the key) and aligns with her involuntary truthfulness. Interiority is specific and grounded (“her voice as clear as the silver bells”), but internal contradiction and visible cost are modest. The confession impulse shapes moments, yet conflict remains gentle. Emotional progression is credible, if not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—sanctifying a restless mind and understanding why houses feel alive—and actions align (buying, placing, and carrying the shard). Interiority is textured but low-conflict; contradictory impulses are faint and pressure is gentle. The elderly woman adds a light relational pressure but doesn’t force a choice. The final acceptance of the role as “catalyst” feels earned though the felt cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear motivation (to “welcome nuance into a certainty”) drives action, and the statue makes purposeful choices (threading memory, guiding organisms). However, interior contradiction and felt cost are minimal; the piece rarely stages competing impulses. Emotional embodiment remains largely conceptual rather than visceral. The “incisively kind” trait reads but isn’t tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aric’s motive—to coax perpetual motion and, later, to honor the persistence of a missed chance—is clear and consistent, and his actions (building, programming, rolling) align. The interior shift from “capture” to “honor” reads earned. However, embodied pressure is light; we don’t feel much bodily stress or contradictory impulses in-scene. The struggle feels smoothed by summary rather than tested through a concrete, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—quietly proving kindness endures—is clear and embodied by repeated micro‑choices (layering paint, leaving notes). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific rather than labeled. The piece lacks palpable internal contradiction or a pressured decision; she never wavers, which flattens heat a touch. Jiro’s presence reflects her impact but does not force a new choice under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive—to revive dying arts—is concrete and consistent, and her actions (reviving the bread ritual, wielding the lens) align. Interiority skews lyric over conflicted; “sweet and dangerous as rosewater” hints at contradiction but rarely sharpens into on‑page dilemma. Costs remain soft (bittersweet acceptance) rather than a felt sacrifice. Still, her choices clearly steer the community’s reawakening.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he seeks to “step beyond fate’s design”—and his choices (decoding the yoyo, turning the key) align with that drive. However, interior contradiction is thin; he rarely doubts or wavers, so pressure doesn’t expose layered impulses. Embodied emotion appears (“bleak exhilaration”), but phrasing repeats rather than deepens. The final endurance feels achieved more than costly, tempering character change.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s desire and tactics are legible (use the clasp, place it on the horse, utter “vanish”), with some embodied stress (“air taste of copper and rot”). However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; she rarely weighs cost against drive on the page. The advisor exerts clear pressure, but Mara’s emotional progression skews atmospheric over specific. The final bargain surfaces a cost but her motivation doesn’t complicate in-scene beyond forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he aims to “turn obstacles into instruments”—but interior contradiction is minimal and largely untested. We get ritualized agency (raising the mallet, deepening the dub) rather than pressured choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion skews atmospheric (“quiet gratitude”) over felt conflict. The resulting endurance stance at the end reads credible but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—decode the shell’s language to save a stalled city—and her choices (decoding, following the passage, initiating contact) align with that drive. Interiority is present through tactile ritual (the whistle) and professional lens (spirals/patterns), but contradiction and felt cost are muted. She solves problems with relative ease, limiting struggle. The final renunciation/shift is credible but emotionally smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Arlen’s motive and worldview are clear and specific (a fictional historian balancing empathy and analysis), and his contradiction—valuing “noble lies” yet seeking to free truth—registers. However, he encounters little resistance; choices (prying, reading, declaring a beacon) proceed smoothly with minimal visible cost. Interiority leans declarative and tidy, trimming ambiguity at the peak. The final acceptance of “transparent honesty” feels earned conceptually but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—cataloging “abandoned dreams”—is clear and coheres with her profession and choices. The paradox “stoically sensitive” is embodied (“heart hammered… face remained a mask”) and her micro‑actions (wading, hiding the inkwell, planting notes, vow) align. The internal conflict remains mostly tonal rather than forcing a hard trade‑off, so the cost is felt but soft. Still, she reads particular and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives (trace honest origins, preserve knowledge) are consistent and drive action, with concrete, character-specific perceptions (ink hue shifting, gear alignment). Interiority is present but low-conflict; she remains highly competent with few contradictory impulses under pressure. The closure choice—revealing and advocating for protection—feels earned but lightly priced. Relationship pressure is offstage (council), so crucible dynamics are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he seeks to transform grief via ritualized craft—and actions align: polishing, folding cranes, placing them among bamboo. Interiority is embodied through tactile labor and sensory cues (steam, jasmine, sapphire gem) rather than labels. Internal contradiction (ascend/descend; easing not erasure) is thematically alive but lacks a hard on‑page dilemma or counter‑pressure that forces a tradeoff. The endurance at the end reads earned, though the micro‑choices are mostly ritual continuations rather than pressured pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear (grief transformed into a hunt for “unused potential”) and actions track it (visor calibration, approach, palm thrust). Embodied details like rust/ozone breath and skin‑tingle ground emotion. However, internal contradiction is limited—he declares “not revenge” early, reducing tension between impulses. The change to “clarity” lands but at a relatively low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lira’s goal and actions (guiding the drone, pulling the lever, vowing to guard the chip) are clear, but her interior contradiction and felt costs are minimal. “Perpetually surprised” colors perception without shaping a hard choice. The pilgrim exerts gentle guidance rather than pressure, so relationship stakes stay soft. The final vow implies responsibility but little on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s guilt is specific (black-market genealogist who “manufactures false memories”) and drives concrete actions—accepting the job, sifting, placing the watch hand. Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with a coherent contradiction between self‑loathing and professional competence. The turn to “honest” dealings lands, but reads a touch tidy and asserted rather than tested on the page. Some repetition of remorse slightly blunts complexity at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear guilt-driven motive and measured, embodied choices (lifting the box, whispering apology, letting the rope fall) build a credible inner arc. The opposing negotiator has texture but applies little counterpressure, so the crucible is largely internal. Resolution trends tidy, with minimal on-page friction testing his resolve. Still, the recalled failed exchange usefully charges the present decision.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (align heart and action) with embodied contradictions (fear vs. pull to sea) gives him dimension. The betrayal memory adds credible wound and biasing of choices. The final acceptance reads earned but slightly tidy, with little on‑page friction testing his resolve. More micro‑choices under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear (seeking redemption/empathy after a neural reset) and actions align: follow clues, face the mirror, relinquish the baseball. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile, luminous details rather than labels. The final renunciation (tossing the ball) reads as a felt cost that forecloses a talismanic comfort. Internal contradiction (dirty past vs clean slate) is sustained without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline—reforge the bond with Arion—and her reluctance adds live tension to each step. Interiority is embodied through scent, touch, and a steady gait rather than abstract labels. Micro‑choices (gathering, mixing, extending her hand) align with motive and reveal cost. The cost lands on the page (bark patterns), though a sharper internal contradiction at the touch would heighten it further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear (soothe the sky-borne twins by retrieving lost time), and her internal release (“unfastened the last knot of her own heart”) reads as a credible cost. Interiority is particular and embodied through object work (saucer, clasp, droplet). However, contradictory impulses are muted; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers. The arc resolves cleanly without a sharp crucible testing her flaws beyond grief.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Nara’s pacifist motivation is clear and governs tactics (stitching with compassion, refusal of force), and her micro-choices (aligning intention, leveraging joy to float, placing the crystal) arise organically. The embodied tension between carrying universal sorrow (“cold pressure on her back”) and forcing a smile to work is specific and felt. Internal contradiction is modest—she rarely falters—so struggle reads muted. The final renunciation/step-through is earned but light on visible personal loss beyond leaving the ship’s ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—seeking the “texture of transformation”—is clear and her actions (setting the jar down, inviting the fisherman, ultimately freeing the fireflies) align with it. Interiority is present if slightly abstract, with a credible mix of skepticism and draw toward prophecy. The giving‑nature (destitute philanthropist) resonates with relinquishing the jar’s captive light, a modest but felt cost. Relationship pressure with the fisherman is light but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motive (to catalyze a silent revolution) is clear and consistently enacted through specific, calmly inventive choices (mirrors, coded marks, sundial tracing). Interiority is restrained; we get little contradiction or embodied cost beyond “quiet intrigue,” so pressure rarely unsettles him. Competence dominates with scant friction, blunting character growth. Still, actions align with motives and reveal a coherent, particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Selene’s drive to understand “sacred patterns” is clear and credible, and her precognitive fear versus compulsion to act produces a genuine, character‑specific tension. Embodied perceptions (kelp sheen, basalt spray) root her interiority in the moment. The decisive micro‑choice—placing the final red stone—aligns action with motive. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (“mantle” of responsibility), keeping this shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he seeks to “map the cartography of scars”—and his micro-choices (setting the timer to 23 minutes, placing the envelope) align with that drive. “Furiously tranquil” offers a credible inner contradiction embodied by calm ritual amid a violent storm. The closing repricing (“not a wound to be healed but a terrain to be traversed”) reads earned but registers more as insight than costly choice. Emotional cost and risk (re: censorship) stay largely implied rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motives are clear (win the duel/turn questions into destinations) but remain largely conceptual, with scant embodied interiority under pressure. The philosopher’s mechanical arm provides character texture and agency, yet his internal conflict is minimal. The diplomat’s “diplomatically fierce” stance shows in a respectful bow and parries toward shared insight but lacks on‑page cost. The closing return scene adds a reflective layer without deepening psychological contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s choices (accepting the tin, sharing the page, planting seeds, organizing the rebuild) reveal motive and agency, and Rook’s quiet counter‑pressure frames a functional partnership. The monthly molting adds texture but little on‑page cost or contradiction. Emotional nuance is conveyed mostly through image, not interior friction. The arc from solitary poet to communal catalyst is credible but lightly earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and persistent (“to surprise fate with an unplanned encore”), and micro‑choices track it (waiting for night, stepping through the reel, placing the clock, playing). Interiority is textured by “steely longing,” but contradictory impulses under pressure are muted; he rarely doubts or falters. The “strategically creative” trait manifests in the splicing/escape plan, aligning action with character. Emotional embodiment leans lyric more than visceral, but it lands at closure with the clock’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—to awaken the seed before the monsoon to safeguard collective memory—is crisp and drives each micro‑choice (mapping symbols, voicing the incantation). Interiority is particular and embodied (“air tasted of citrus and rain,” “luminous doubt”), with credible ambivalence between fear of failure and resolve. The “reality checker” identity coheres with her empirically whimsical method, avoiding stock heroism. The visible cost is mostly emotional risk rather than material sacrifice, but it reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular—the tutor vows to diffuse the islet’s sorrow by finding “the color of unspoken apologies.” Interiority and action align through the ritual knots and slow cadence. However, internal contradiction or visible cost is light; serenity dominates over struggle. The final acceptance reads earned but relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to "strip needless drama" is clear and consistent, providing a strong internal arc from a grand-scale researcher to one focused on humble particulars. The shift from chasing supernovas to tending "garden ghosts" is well-realized. However, her interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness, and the final epiphany feels slightly less earned and more declared, lacking the simultaneous contradictory impulses of a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elya's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on overly articulate, diagnostic statements. Phrases like "steadily adaptive" are stated three times, functioning as a label rather than an embodied trait revealed through struggle. The final realization feels more like a summarized epiphany than a hard-won, contradictory internal shift, which slightly undermines the emotional weight of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her traumatic past. The interiority is concrete, especially the physical memory of the sea and calloused hands. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("She realized that to translate silence... she needed... the willingness to hear"), which verges on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a purely embodied shift in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marlow's motivation is clear and poetically established, serving as an effective engine for this short, atmospheric piece. However, his characterization relies more on a consistent, archetypal state (weary, resolute) than on dramatized internal conflict. While his stubbornness is demonstrated, the internal contradictions that create deep character are summarized rather than shown acting in scene, making him feel more like a vessel for the theme than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but she remains largely untested. Lacking a significant internal conflict or an on-page struggle that forces difficult choices, her character reads as benevolently competent rather than complex; her emotions are sometimes stated ("felt a surge of hope") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Milo's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, directly driving the narrative. His actions, particularly the use of his artistic tools for a spiritual purpose, are consistent with his established traits. The primary weakness is in the interiority, which occasionally slips into abstract summary ("He remembered the teaching that to heal...") rather than maintaining a fully embodied, in-the-moment perspective, slightly distancing the reader from his experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains highly abstract and intellectual. Her key trait, being "retrocognitively trapped," is stated but never dramatized, leaving it as an unearned label that doesn't influence any on-page choices or perceptions. While her actions align with her goal, the lack of embodied emotion or internal contradiction makes her feel more like a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and potent, but her characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is sacrificed for a mythic tone, with traits like "patient, strategic resolve" stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal conflict. The symbolic "chains" that conveniently rust loose at the end undercut their potential as a meaningful constraint that could have forced compelling micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her synesthetic perception provides a unique interiority. However, her core understanding of her task arrives as a declared epiphany ("She understood that to find the sound... she must first hear the silence...") rather than an embodied, contradictory struggle, slightly flattening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's character is more of a vessel for the plot than an agent driving it. Her motivation shifts from thievery to preservation in a single, unearned epiphany ("Lira realized the thief’s true calling..."). There is no internal conflict or genuine struggle; she follows a path laid out for her by a helpful conductor, making her "savvy" trait feel like an unfulfilled label.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively embodied through the specific, ritualized actions of glassblowing. Her interiority is poetic and aligns with her role. The primary weakness is a lack of significant internal conflict; she arrives with a "thoughtfully spirited resolve" and ends with it solidified, making the journey a confirmation rather than a struggle with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear but overly articulated, relying on direct statements like "promising that I would transform betrayal into a weapon." The internal conflict feels more summarized than embodied, with Mara's self-awareness ("my greatest stunt was simply surviving my own terror") reading as a diagnostic conclusion rather than a feeling experienced in a moment of crisis. The transformation is rapid, making the final state of being "fearless" feel more asserted than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The oracle's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization is more archetypal than individual. He serves as a perfect vessel for the story's lyrical concept, yet he lacks the internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected for a higher score. The attribute "mildly obsessed" is stated but not dramatized with sufficient pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The robot’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. The shift from a programmed function to an emergent purpose is well-handled. However, the interiority occasionally relies on summarizing labels like "felt a quiet awe," rather than consistently showing this state through the robot's unique perceptual filters or processing, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara serves as a functional vehicle for the plot and theme, but lacks compelling interiority. Her motivation ("to thaw mistrust") is stated rather than dramatized through internal conflict or a difficult choice with personal cost. She acts as an observer and facilitator whose core self is never at risk, making her feel more like a symbol than a person with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine dresser's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. However, his core attribute of being "wisely pragmatic" is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or trade-off. His internal state, particularly the central paradox of "blooming withering," is often articulated through direct labels ("echoing his dual nature") rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses acting within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary trait of being "obliging" feels more like a label than a tested characteristic. She acts as a functional and competent vehicle for the central concept, but lacks the deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses needed for exceptional characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation feels asserted rather than deeply earned; the motive to unravel the code "surged within her" in response to external cues. She functions more as a sensitive vessel for the atmosphere than a character with compelling internal conflict or flaws. Her interiority is poetic but lacks the specific, contradictory texture that would elevate her beyond a type.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mirela's motivation to quantify a "swallowed truth" is clear and compelling, and her interiority is expressed through a unique, embodied ritual. The characterization is strong, showing a consistent and specific worldview where data and feeling merge. However, the emotional state is sometimes described with lyrical but slightly abstract labels like "auroral sorrow," which, while evocative, can feel more performed than experienced in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a functional conduit for the story's concept, and his final choice to leave the wheel provides a clear moment of earned stasis. However, his defining traits—"reckless" and "religiously skeptical"—read as labels rather than drivers of action. The skepticism, in particular, creates no meaningful internal friction, as he readily uses paranormal data by simply reframing it, which feels like a missed opportunity for genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicle keeper is a consistent archetype whose motivation is clear, but the characterization lacks depth. His interiority is conveyed through abstract, poetic statements rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final change is more of a serene affirmation of his existing purpose than a resolution born from genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora's characterization is consistent but lacks depth. Her motivation ("to nurture lifelong wonder") and emotional state ("cautious exuberance") are stated directly rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. She functions more as a serene conduit for the story's theme than a complex individual under pressure, reading as an archetype without compelling flaws or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian's motivation is clear and consistent, but the character serves more as a capable lens for the story's concept than a figure of compelling internal contradiction. His perceptiveness is well-demonstrated through action, but his progression is linear and lacks the friction of competing impulses. He reads as an archetypal scholar, meticulously competent but without the flaws or blind spots that would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The writer’s motivation is clear but stated abstractly ("to transpose life into a new key") rather than demonstrated through internal conflict. The "sudden surge of purpose" feels more like a conceptual necessity than an earned psychological shift. The character functions effectively as a vessel for the story's high concept but lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses of a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    The priest's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is conveyed through abstract summary ("he sensed," "he knew") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. He functions flawlessly as a ritualist without the internal conflict or specific flaws that would make his struggle feel particular and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation and interiority are rendered with exceptional specificity ("chronologically homesick," "compass for thoughts"). The final change of perspective is earned within the story's logic. However, the internal conflict feels more like a seamless process of transformation than a struggle between genuinely contradictory impulses acting in-scene, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's motivation is stated but remains entirely abstract. Interiority consists of a series of high-concept declarations rather than embodied, contradictory emotions. The climax, "He realized that to conquer the labyrinth of self, he must accept...", is a classic example of unearned, diagnostic epiphany, telling the reader a conclusion instead of dramatizing the struggle that would make it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marin’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on an elegant but unvarying set of metaphors (frost, filament, hush). While poetic, this abstracts her emotional state rather than embodying contradictory impulses in the moment of choice. The resolution is earned through action, but the character’s internal experience reads more as a perfectly calibrated poetic concept than a messy, human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her "meticulous" and "lateral" thinking nature. However, her interiority feels overly articulated and diagnostic, particularly when she explicitly names her motivation ("to nurture integrity in solitude") and problem-solving method. This intellectual summary lessens the feeling of immediate, embodied struggle, making her seem more like a narrator of her own experience than a participant in it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen's motivation is clear, poignant, and drives the entire narrative. The shift from a personal quest for understanding to a broader mission of "charting a map of scent-induced sorrow" is a strong change. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("He realized that the impact of memories was not a passive archive but a living current..."), a moment of diagnostic self-awareness that tempers the raw emotion of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet’s motivation is clear but abstract, serving more as a thematic vessel than a character with tangible needs. His core trait, "ethically playful," is asserted rather than demonstrated through choices with contradictory impulses or meaningful tradeoffs. The final decision feels like a foregone conclusion that serves the story’s thesis, lacking the weight of a personally costly internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The violinist’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively serving the story's thematic aims. Her interiority is well-rendered through her unique acoustic perception. However, the character acts more as a perfect conduit for the theme than as an individual with internal friction or contradictory impulses, which keeps her from feeling fully dimensional under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored by her "affectionate detachment." However, the interiority occasionally lapses into abstract self-diagnosis that feels more like authorial summary than embodied thought. The final reflection on selling "a perfect balance of insight and empathy" reads as a thematic label, slightly flattening the character's complex professional calculus into a tidy tagline.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear but lacks compelling internal conflict. The transition from "shrewd... broker" to a pure conduit of compassion is asserted rather than earned through a difficult choice or the confrontation of a genuine flaw. Her "cautious exuberance" is a nice touch, but her internal landscape is smooth and uncomplicated, making her feel more like a function of the theme than a complex individual. The lighthouse keeper serves his role but remains a sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen’s motivation is explicit and profound, providing a clear engine for the story. However, her defining trait, being "boldly sympathetic," is asserted rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or internal conflict. Her interiority feels more like a vessel for the story's theme than a complex, contradictory human mind under pressure, making her feel slightly more archetypal than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear but singular, lacking the internal contradiction expected at this level. She functions more as a vessel for the story's lyrical concept than a character making costly choices. The final decision to release the pendant reads as an inevitable, frictionless discovery rather than a sacrifice born from struggle, limiting her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conjurer’s motivation is clear but lacks compelling interiority. His purpose is stated ("a delicate dance between curiosity and compassion") rather than revealed through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The emotional arc feels pre-determined and abstract, with insights like "buried optimism blooming like a night flower" reading more as thematic labels than embodied experiences. The character is a functional, gentle vessel for the story's concept, but lacks the necessary flaws or internal friction to make his final realization feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren serves as a symbolic vessel for the theme rather than a complex character. Her motivation ("to become visible") and traits ("kindly methodical") are stated directly and consistently, but she lacks any internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The interiority feels more like authorial commentary on the story's meaning, as in the line "...visibility was not merely being seen, but allowing the quiet grief...to surface," which is diagnostic and lacks character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marlowe's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but his characterization relies on the repeated label "circuitously sincere" rather than dramatizing a compelling internal contradiction. His observational role keeps him at a distance, and the final philosophical shift, while earned, lacks the texture of a deeply felt internal struggle with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority slips into diagnostic summary at the climax. The line "Mara felt the meaning she had long been threshing from her experiences pour into the air" is an abstract label for a peak emotional moment, rather than an embodied experience. While the ultimate choice is earned, this reliance on summary over concrete feeling keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira's motivation and arc are clear, moving from a desire for control to acceptance. However, her interiority is weak, often expressed in abstract, thematic language ("feels the everyday magic magnify into a gentle fire") rather than specific, embodied emotion. Her key realization reads more like an authorial summary than a character-particular thought, which keeps the characterization from achieving literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archivist is a compelling figure, but his characterization operates more as a consistent, poetic function than a person with internal friction. Motivation is clear but static; he never seems to doubt his purpose or struggle against his past isolation. The turn from "lonely exile into a communal chorus" is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized internal shift, making the moment resonant but emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot. However, her interiority, while present, relies on slightly generalized states like "tremor of certainty" and "awe" rather than more concrete, contradictory impulses. She functions more as a highly competent lens for the reader to experience the mystery than a character with deep internal conflict or palpable flaws, which keeps this from the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira's central contradiction as a "sympathetic skeptic" is well-established and drives her internal arc. Her micro-actions, like offering tea to the wind, embody this conflict effectively. The final change feels earned, though some characterization relies on direct labels ("courageously kind") rather than being purely dramatized through higher-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The immortal's motivation—ennui seeking intrigue—is clear and effectively drives the story from the inciting incident to the final choice. The internal change from bored stasis to purposeful engagement is earned. However, the interiority occasionally relies on labels like "a surge of understanding, a quiet awe" rather than fully embodying the shift through perception or action, slightly abstracting the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal arc resolves through declarative epiphanies rather than embodied struggle. The line, “She understood that the fairness she sought could not be imposed by law alone,” is a diagnostic summary that flattens the peak emotional moment. While her actions are driven by her history, her internal experience feels articulated from an analytical distance, lacking the contradictory impulses of a character under immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative's quiet action. However, his interiority, while poetic, lacks the contradictory impulses or specific flaws of a top-tier characterization. He functions more as an elegant vessel for the story's central concept than a psychologically complex individual, which keeps the portrayal strong but just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and poetically rendered, culminating in a well-earned internal shift from searching for a personal truth to embracing a communal purpose. The interiority is consistent and specific, particularly in the desire for the "texture of memories." However, the characterization lacks a moment of sharp internal contradiction acting in-scene; the progression is more of a steady, linear accumulation toward the final, resonant epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's core contradiction, "gloomy cheerfulness," is established and maintained, but her final epiphany feels overly articulated and intellectually neat. The resolution lands more as a summary of the theme than a viscerally earned shift in perspective. Her motivation is clear, but the internal experience of the final change lacks the messy, embodied quality of a profound personal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on labels like "culture shock absorber" and "orderly intuitive mind" rather than dramatized choices. Her core internal conflict, the "dual allegiance," is stated but resolved without a tangible on-page cost; the phoenix mural offers a symbolic solution that avoids a difficult trade-off. Emotion is asserted ("hopeful desperation") rather than embodied, making her feel more like a capable plot functionary than a person experiencing contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    The inspector's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains somewhat archetypal. His interiority is conveyed through poetic reflection ("it was an elegy") rather than through contradictory impulses revealed in action. The final moment of grief and solace is stated more than embodied, making the emotional arc feel slightly intellectualized rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority rooted in her specific sensory experience. Her blindness is not a limitation but the source of her unique competence, a strength shown through her micro-choices at the workbench. The story earns her final stance of quiet dedication, with the cost being the perpetual, isolated nature of her vital work, which feels authentic and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are decisive, but a core character trait is unfulfilled. The story states she is "dry-witted," yet her interiority and the narrative voice are consistently lyrical and earnest, creating a dissonance. The line "her dry-witted sarcasm softened" is a tell that admits the trait wasn't shown, weakening an otherwise solid portrayal of a confident professional facing the sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tuner functions effectively as an archetype or mythic figure, but lacks the interiority and contradictory impulses expected of a top-tier protagonist. His motivation is clear but never tested by internal conflict or a moment of doubt. He is a perfectly calibrated instrument for the plot, which limits his depth as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation shifts from a rumor-chasing quest to a sudden altruistic epiphany ("to harness the ephemeral") without sufficient dramatized struggle. The story relies on declarative statements like "She understood that the vial's power lay... by overriding instinct," which functions as diagnostic label-speak, telling us the character change rather than embodying it through a series of difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    The boy's motivation is split between a clear, compelling need for redemption and an overly abstract, authorial statement ("to thread a labyrinth with your own story"). While his actions are consistent, his interiority feels more like a vessel for the story's poetic concepts than a site of genuine, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost bride's motivation to repay a debt is clear and consistent, driving the narrative arc. Her internal conflict, the "lovingly venomous affection," is effectively externalized in the climax. However, her interiority remains somewhat archetypal and abstract, conveyed through grand emotional labels ("mournful elation") rather than granular, embodied specifics, which keeps it just shy of top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The weaver is a consistent archetype, but lacks the depth of a fully realized character. Her motivation is clear but abstract ("ruin to reverence"), and her interiority is asserted with labels like "hauntingly optimistic heart" rather than shown through internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her success feels preordained, without the sense of struggle or flawed choices that would make her profound purpose feel earned against genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear, but her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of internal conflict. She remains in a state of unwavering reverence, and her emotions are often stated with labels like "warmly curious" rather than embodied through contradictory action or perception. The character functions more as a vessel for the story's theme than a complex individual whose choices feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear but stated rather than dramatized. She functions as a competent executor of a beautiful concept, but lacks internal conflict or any legible flaw; her success feels preordained. The characterization serves the aesthetic but remains emotionally distant, lacking the contradictory impulses that create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, creating a coherent archetypal figure. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction or embodied struggle; she feels more like a flawless instrument of the story's concept than a complex individual. The core attribute, "disguises wisdom as foolishness," is stated but only paid off in a single action (the disguised receipt), leaving the characterization feeling somewhat thin under the weight of the mythic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    The medium’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on the repeated, abstract label "fierce tenderness." While her emotional progression is legible, it lacks the specific, contradictory embodiment expected at the highest level; the feeling is declared more than it is viscerally experienced through contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The translator's motivation is clear and her interiority is rich with metaphor. However, her characterization leans toward an archetype of perfect competence and wisdom. The absence of a tangible flaw or an internal contradiction that complicates her choices on the page prevents her from feeling fully dimensional, keeping the score from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The artist's motivation is clear and consistent but lacks complexity. Her interiority feels more like a vehicle for the story's theme than the experience of a specific, flawed individual. The absence of internal conflict or a single moment of doubt renders her success emotionally frictionless, making the final earned change feel pleasant rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lena's motivation is an abstract thematic label ("exchange certainty for curiosity") rather than a grounded, character-specific need. Her interiority relies on telling and diagnostic language like "felt a nested awakening," which summarizes emotional states instead of embodying them. The final change is declared rather than earned, as her initial state of "certainty" is never dramatized, making the cost of its loss purely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lysander's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict; he is a vessel for the theme of defiance rather than a person struggling with it. Dr. Mirabel's conversion from scientist to protector is too abrupt, occurring in a single sentence without a dramatized internal process, which weakens the climax. The other club members are allegorical figures, not characters.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal rather than individual. The internal state is described with beautiful language but lacks contradictory impulses acting in a scene; he is a vessel for a singular, centuries-long yearning. The "shyly unstoppable" paradox is a compelling label but isn't tested through a choice with a visible trade-off, making the character feel more like a concept than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal state of "foxglove regret" is elegantly established and tracked. The emotional progression from sorrow to purposeful gratitude, and finally to a nuanced, cyclical acceptance of sorrow, is earned and resonant. However, the internal conflict feels more like a sustained emotional state than a dynamic struggle between contradictory impulses until the traveler's arrival provides a point of release.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on high-level labels like “carefully reckless” and “cautious exuberance” rather than fully embodying these contradictions through micro-choices. While her actions align with her goals, the internal conflict lacks the texture of simultaneous, competing impulses acting in-scene; it reads more as a resolved professional competence. The characterization is strong and functional but stops short of exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira’s motivation to “harmonize conflicting values” remains an abstract summary rather than a dramatized need. Her ingenuity is asserted but never truly tested, as the solution arrives via a convenient discovery, not a struggle revealing character. The council elder’s climactic change of heart is told (“felt his long-held doubts tremble”), not shown, making the resolution feel emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. The interiority is strong, but the final epiphany is stated directly ("She realized that reinvention does not erase, but layers...") rather than fully embodied through a final, contradictory micro-choice under pressure, which slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The child’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks significant internal conflict. His progression feels more like a seamless, poetic unfolding of destiny than a struggle between contradictory impulses. While his actions align with his goals, the final transformation into a “keeper” is an epiphany that feels more received than earned through a difficult choice with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aria’s motivation is clear, but her characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict. Her journey reads as a smooth, successful spiritual quest without the contradictory impulses or blind spots that create a truly compelling protagonist. Phrases like "her steps softly ingenious" feel like an authorial label rather than embodied character, thinning the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions effectively. Her interiority is tangible, though it occasionally relies on labels like "cheerful gloom" rather than fully embodied contradictions. The final emotional state of "hopeful sorrow" is earned by the story's events, representing a credible change from her initial quest for answers to an acceptance of resonant feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The performer's motivation is clear but functions more as an unwavering philosophical thesis than a dynamic, human need. He is a consistent but thin vessel for the story's concept, lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses that would create a truly compelling character; his actions illustrate his philosophy rather than discovering it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on declarative statements ("She claimed the solitude spontaneously anchored her spirit") rather than fully embodied emotional contradictions. The final transformation is earned within the story's lyric logic, but the key moment of change is summarized ("She felt the exile within her dissolve"), which slightly lessens its impact by using a diagnostic label instead of showing the feeling through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clearly stated but her character lacks specificity beyond her role as a thematic vessel. Her "unsettled thoughts" are a generic placeholder for internal conflict, and the resolution feels asserted rather than earned through a dramatized struggle. The character's interiority is expressed in an overly articulate, philosophical register ("noctilucent reckonings," "natural scripture") that feels inconsistent with the grounded profession of a "harbor glazier," creating a disconnect between role and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on abstract labels like "hard softness" and being "gently skilled at stitching wounds with silence." Her interiority is more poetic summary than a dramatized internal conflict. While her actions align with her motives, she lacks the sharp, contradictory impulses that would elevate the character from a symbolic vessel to a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    Arin's motivation as a "logical dreamer" is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. His interiority is asserted rather than embodied; we are told he is "lucidly watchful" but rarely witness internal conflict or contradictory impulses that would make him feel human. He functions more as a flawless archetype for the story's theme than a character struggling with the stakes, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her arc—from solitary archivist to facilitator of a shared history—is legible. However, her interiority reads more as a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual with contradictory impulses. The transformation of her "legacy's burden" feels more like a smooth intellectual realization than a choice born from tangible internal conflict, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter's motivation is clear but stated late and lacks on-page contradiction or struggle. His core trait, "perceptively calm," is asserted rather than tested; he experiences no internal conflict, which flattens his character into a graceful automaton executing a magical task. The backstory reveal feels like an explanation added to justify the motive, rather than a pressure that informs choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s character is defined by labels like "operatively gentle" rather than demonstrated through difficult, contradictory choices in the scene. Her interiority consists of summarized emotional states ("she must muster the courage," "felt the weight...settle") instead of embodied, moment-to-moment experience. The chieftains serve as props for her success, lacking agency or internal conflict of their own.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's core contradiction—amoral methods driven by sentimental yearning—is compelling and consistent. His actions are grand and align with his stated power, while his private goal feels specific and intimate. The final moment of allowing a tear feels earned, a poignant micro-choice that pays off the internal conflict without resolving his fundamental nature.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The character of the courtesan is a potent archetype, and her motivation is clear and consistent. However, she functions more as an elegant symbol for the story's theme than a fully realized individual. Her interiority remains somewhat abstract, conveyed through poetic labels ("bodily poetic rhythm") rather than contradictory impulses or embodied struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation to explore "ethical storytelling" is clear and consistent, driving the story's central action. However, Selene herself reads more as a sophisticated vessel for the theme than a fully embodied individual. The collection of traits—"urbane calligrapher," "salvaged" "campfire story stick," performer in "seedy bars"—feels curated for effect rather than organically integrated, and her epiphany is articulated with a diagnostic clarity that lessens its emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s characterization as an “esoteric realist” is successfully dramatized through her actions, which blend the logical (mapping routes) with the mythic (honoring silent travelers). Her motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative. However, her interiority, while tonally rich, relies heavily on abstract and atmospheric descriptions of emotion ("a blushing stillness") rather than more specific, embodied contradictions, which slightly distances the reader from her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and linked to a compelling internal need for redemption. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into overly articulate, diagnostic statements like "a ritual of redemption," which summarize the emotional arc rather than letting the embodied action carry the weight. The repetition of the phrase "technically gentle" also slightly flattens the specificity of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but "Foresight Hindsight Only" functions more as a conceptual vessel than a person with embodied emotions or internal contradictions. Her primary trait—seeing past and future but not the present—is stated but doesn't create a tangible on-page struggle that she must overcome. The resolution is an intellectual epiphany rather than an earned change born from a difficult choice or dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    Nabu’s motivation is clear but his characterization relies heavily on labels like "frugal" and "analytical heart" rather than dramatized choices. The core tension is repeatedly stated as "empirically ironic," which functions as an authorial summary rather than a felt, internal conflict. His actions are consistent, but the character reads more as a functional archetype to enact the plot than a person with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation as a “scheming pacifist” is clear, but her characterization remains more conceptual than embodied. Her scheme unfolds without any meaningful friction or internal contradiction, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a person under pressure. The lack of a genuine struggle or a moment of doubt renders the successful outcome less earned; she is an architect of the events, but not a participant in their emotional crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. He functions more as a vessel for the story's magical conceit than a person with internal contradictions or flaws. His success feels preordained, without a moment of genuine struggle or doubt, which limits emotional investment; he is an archetypal wise craftsman who performs his task perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her core trait of being "endearingly feisty" is asserted rather than dramatized; her on-page actions are almost exclusively gentle and patient. The internal conflict is more of a resolved state of seeking than an active struggle in-scene. While the character arc to renewed purpose is satisfying, it lacks the friction of a contradictory impulse acting within the pivotal moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The curator's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear, but his characterization relies heavily on abstract labels like "bewildered" and "simply complicated" rather than embodied experience. The final emotional state of "brightened disquiet" is an insightful concept, but it's asserted rather than earned through a granular depiction of his internal struggle. His pivotal change is an intellectual acceptance, which feels more passive than a choice compelled by contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Selene's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her stated role as a "carefully resourceful" linguist. However, her characterization remains largely functional. We observe her competence but are given little access to her interiority, such as any internal conflict, doubt, or sensory experience under pressure, which keeps her at an emotional distance. The time traveler serves as a framing device rather than a character applying on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist serves as a strong archetype whose motivation is clear and effectively drives the plot. However, the characterization remains abstract, relying on evocative labels like "chimera twin discoverer" rather than embodied, contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her interiority is consistently poetic but lacks the specific, flawed texture needed for a top-tier rating.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" is exceptionally clear and drives every action she takes. Her methodical nature is well-demonstrated through her process. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or embodied emotion; she reads as a highly competent, almost frictionless agent solving a puzzle, which keeps her at a slight distance and limits the emotional depth of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. However, the character's interiority feels more functional than deeply inhabited, culminating in an epiphany ("He understood that the quiet he sought was not the absence of sound...") that reads more like a thematic summary than an earned, embodied realization. The lack of any meaningful internal contradiction or struggle makes him a competent but somewhat flat protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but its expression borders on diagnostic self-awareness ("My motivation is simple yet stubborn"). While the shift from a personal to a communal purpose is earned by the story's climax, the interiority remains more lyrical and abstract than concretely embodied, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, the character's interiority relies on abstract, declarative labels like "preemptively nostalgic" rather than fully embodied emotion. While the arc from this stated grief to "steady resolve" is earned, the character sometimes feels more like a thoughtful vessel for the story's theme than a person with contradictory impulses acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is clear but remains somewhat abstract and archetypal. Interiority relies on labels like "serious playfulness" and "fierce resolve" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses through on-page choices. The final epiphany, "He understood that his wandering had purpose," reads more as a thematic summary assigned to him than a psychologically earned shift resulting from a crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicler's motivation is clear and her interiority is specific and evocative, particularly in her perception of time as a texture. However, characterization remains somewhat static; she is more of a perfect, sensitive instrument than a person facing internal contradiction or a difficult choice. The final epiphany feels more like a beautifully articulated summary of the theme than a change earned through personal struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lio's motivation is exceptionally clear, unique, and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict of claustrophobia is well-embodied in his "contracted" chest, and the resolution feels earned as his fear dissolves and his heart expands. The character's decisive change is rooted in his on-page choices, particularly the realization about limiting exposure, making the final transformation both credible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear but is over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic summary ("Lira’s motivation was clear: to teach..."). While her actions are consistent, the interiority relies on telling rather than embodying the struggle; the realization that she must "dissolve the agitation within herself" is presented as a neat conclusion rather than a messy internal process. The character is functional and consistent, but lacks the compelling internal contradictions for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mina's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as "unflinching" and proceeds without any internal conflict, doubt, or meaningful struggle, making her journey feel predetermined and emotionally sterile. The story states a "duality" of nostalgia and hope, but this is never dramatized as a genuine conflict; she simply succeeds without facing any trade-offs or difficult choices, reading more as a competent functionary than a compelling protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper's motivation, "to teach the suffocating darkness to breathe," is a compelling paradoxical concept but remains an abstract thesis rather than a deeply embodied need. His interiority is conveyed through poetic summary ("sensed an audience of shadows") rather than a dramatized internal conflict with contradictory impulses. He reads as a serene functionary of the plot, a vessel for the theme, lacking the specific flaws or internal friction that would make his ultimate choice feel like a hard-won struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in their backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor. However, the internal conflict between wariness and hope is often stated ("I hesitated, recalling...") rather than embodied through visceral, contradictory impulses in the scene. The final realization feels more like a tidy summary of the theme than a hard-won, character-specific shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lian's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. However, his interiority feels more like a vessel for the story's concepts ("bridge of intuition," "conduit of intuition") than a depiction of a person grappling with a complex discovery. The final realization that the scroll is a lesson is accepted too readily, lacking the internal friction or contradictory impulses expected in a character facing a disillusioning truth about their lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The knight's motivation shifts from an abstract concept ("capture the shape of possibility") to a tangible commitment, which is a clear arc. However, his interiority relies heavily on repeating these abstract labels rather than showing a complex, embodied emotional journey. The final transformation, "his armor melt into the moss," is a powerful image of change, but the internal contradictions leading to this surrender of self feel more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amelia's motivation is clear and consistent, but her core trait of being "broken-hearted" operates more as a static label than an active, contradictory force. The emotional arc is plausible but articulated with some summary and cliché, as when her heart is "stitching itself back together." The supervisor's immediate, frictionless agreement misses an opportunity to test her newfound conviction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a consistent and functional archetype of the quiet rebel, and her actions align with her stated motives. However, her characterization lacks depth; interiority is conveyed through lyrical summary rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her "fierce resolve" is asserted, but we don't witness an internal struggle or a moment where her values are genuinely tested against each other on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving his singular action. However, his interiority lacks texture; he is presented as a competent, resolved vessel for the magic rather than a character with internal contradictions. The choice to "whisper" is a good micro-choice, but the overall portrayal is more archetype than individual, missing the friction of competing impulses that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving all her actions. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; the transformation is presented as a smooth, harmonious process rather than a struggle. While her "orderly soul" is mentioned as a starting point, we don't see this trait create friction or require a difficult trade-off during her mystical awakening, making the change feel more inevitable than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her attraction to forgotten things. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic summary, as seen in "Each serendipitous clue felt like a friend extending a hand, urging her to befriend uncertainty," which tells the reader the emotional conclusion rather than embodying the process of reaching it. The final change is earned by her actions, but the internal conflict feels low-friction.

    The alchemist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract labels like “luminous regret” and “fragmented self‑knowledge” rather than embodied emotion. The character’s internal state is often summarized with a philosophical distance, particularly in the line about redemption being a “continuous negotiation,” which reads more like an authorial thesis than a character’s specific thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s character is functional but lacks deep interior contradiction. The defining trait "modestly fearless" is stated rather than dramatized through a choice with tradeoffs. Her epiphany about laughter feels more like a convenient discovery than an earned insight rooted in a specific personal struggle, and the line "She understood her purpose" is summary that replaces embodied feeling at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. However, the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic language ("remembering through trauma responses—to map the forest's hidden patterns") which feels more like a clinical summary than an embodied, in-the-moment experience of a survivor. The final emotional state is earned, but the expression of it can be overly articulate for a character under such stress.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and consistent, and their interiority is specific to their unique profession. The final change, an acceptance of their role as a living beacon, is earned. However, the character lacks a significant internal conflict or contradiction; their journey reads more like a flawless execution of a known ritual than a struggle that tests their values, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from "burden" to "purpose" provides a satisfying closure. However, her core competence is undermined at the climax when she performs an action—engaging an elevator circuit in a ticket office—that is disconnected from the physical reality of the scene. This breaks the crucial alignment between her traits, knowledge, and actions, making her pivotal choice feel arbitrary rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains abstract. Her interiority is expressed through conceptual statements ("believing the crystalline geometry could encode...") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. She functions effectively as an agent for the story's concept but lacks the particularity and internal conflict expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her past as a "defunct revolutionary." However, her interiority, while poetic, occasionally reads more as elegant authorial summary than as the specific, contradictory thoughts of a character under pressure. The central emotional state of "burnished sorrow" is effectively established as a motif, but the internal conflict between triumph and regret is stated more than it is dramatized through her choices in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Alder's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his mystical craftsman persona. However, his characterization lacks depth; he is highly competent and faces no significant internal conflict, contradiction, or moment of doubt. The struggle feels external and procedural, making him more of an archetype than a complex individual whose flaws complicate the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions align with it, but her core trait of "sensibly eccentric" is more of a label than a demonstrated internal conflict. Her interiority is concrete, especially in her sensory focus, but the final epiphany feels more like an intellectual acceptance than a change earned through a visible struggle between contradictory impulses. The characterization is strong and consistent, but lacks the crucible of a truly difficult internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation is an abstract thesis ("scaffold complexity with simplicity") rather than a deeply felt need. Her interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak, articulating the story's themes with an analytical distance that flattens her into a mouthpiece for the concept. While her actions are consistent, the lack of embodied emotion or internal contradiction makes her realization feel more intellectual than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific childhood memory that drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is vividly rendered, though it occasionally veers into abstract emotional labels like "umbral tenderness." The final change is earned by her actions, but the articulation of her epiphany—"the answer lay not in a single explanation but in the quiet dialogue between darkness and light"—reads more like a thematic summary than a raw, character-particular realization.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is strong and consistent, driving the narrative forward. However, her characterization relies on elevated but abstract internal states like "searing reverie" rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her competence is absolute; she solves every complex problem without a dramatized struggle or a single misstep, which makes her feel more like a narrative function than a flawed, compelling individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear and his defining trait—rejecting false comfort—drives the plot. However, he functions more as a noble archetype than a psychologically complex character. His core internal conflict is presented as a settled premise rather than a dramatized, in-scene struggle, which limits the potential for deeper characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Harel's motivation is clear and consistent with his role as an archivist. His interiority is conveyed through rich sensory detail, but the pivotal epiphany—that the child is a future archivist—feels more like a thematic assertion than an earned character realization. The connection made via the field trip memory is a convenient bridge rather than a compelling, contradictory internal struggle, slightly weakening the foundation of his final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but her internal state feels more asserted than embodied. Phrases like "furiously tranquil" and "a storm of calm" are compelling labels but the contradiction isn't fully dramatized through her actions, which are mostly receptive and serene. Her character arc is one of acceptance rather than struggle, which fits the tone but limits the depth of conflict and change shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character is consistent and his motivation is clear, but he lacks compelling internal conflict. He reads more as a highly competent functionary than a complex individual under pressure. Phrases like "his credibly curious drive transformed into a quiet stewardship" summarize his change with abstract labels rather than dramatizing a difficult internal shift earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characterization is evocative but archetypal, relying heavily on a single, sustained emotional state of reverence. While the internal journey towards finding strength in vulnerability is clear, the final shift is articulated more as an epiphany ("Understanding blossomed") than a choice born from contradictory impulses in-scene. The motivation is consistent, but the janitor's interiority lacks the specific, contradictory texture that would elevate him from a symbol to a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character functions as a vessel for the story's theme but lacks compelling interiority. His primary traits ("astonished," "tranquilly perceptive") are stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The resolution is an acceptance of a revealed truth, rather than an earned change born from internal struggle, making him feel passive.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clearly established as a desire "to understand the texture of time passing," and her actions consistently serve this goal. However, her interiority remains somewhat abstract. The resolution provides a conceptual fulfillment rather than an earned emotional shift rooted in contradictory impulses; her final smile feels a bit too simple for a character whose days are supposedly "borrowed."

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The poet's motivation is clear but one-dimensional, serving as a vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual. His interiority consists of lyrical, abstract declarations ("fragment of woven dawns") rather than embodied, contradictory emotions. The repetition of the trait "warmly attentive" acts as a label, and his actions feel more like choreographed gestures in a thematic tableau than choices driven by internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her defining trait of "brazen calm" flattens her internal experience. She lacks the palpable internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected under a death sentence, which makes her feel more like an archetype than a person. Her characterization is stable but lacks the granular, embodied emotion of a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arin's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies on assertive labels like "luminous skeptic" and "academically rebellious" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. His internal shift from defiant inquiry to dialogue partner feels somewhat frictionless. The core desire is present, but the internal conflict lacks the texture of a genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and consistent, but he functions more as a symbolic priest performing a rite than a character with tangible internal conflict. While his purpose is deeply felt, the absence of any contradictory impulse or meaningful struggle in the moment keeps the characterization from achieving the highest tier of complexity. His actions are perfectly aligned with his motives, but he lacks the flaws or internal friction that would make his earned peace feel more hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rook is a compelling vessel for the story's mood, but his characterization lacks depth. The motivation, while clear, is delivered via reflection rather than demonstrated through conflicted choice. His journey from discovery to fulfillment is linear and without internal friction, making his final transformation feel more like an inevitable outcome than a hard-won change earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear—to find direction amid loss—but the execution of their internal arc relies on declared epiphanies rather than embodied struggle. The shift from "confusion" to "quiet resolve" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment. While the character acts consistently, their interiority feels overly articulate and emotionally tidy, especially in lines like "turn confusion into exploration," which reads more like a thematic thesis than an organic, in-scene realization.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but his interiority lacks genuine conflict. Phrases like "cautious abandon" are stated rather than embodied, and his final epiphany feels more like a thematic summary than an earned, character-specific realization. The core archetype is strong, but the lack of demonstrated internal struggle or contradictory impulses keeps it from feeling deeply individual.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and conceptually strong, but her characterization relies more on elegant summary than embodied action. The "crisis actor" background offers a compelling paradox but doesn't influence her on-page choices, remaining a thematic label. While her resolve is admirable, the absence of a tangible internal conflict or a difficult trade-off makes her feel more like a noble vessel for the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices from the initial summons to the final confrontation with painful memory. The internal conflict between the desire for home and the pain of recollection is well-dramatized in the moment she presses the feather deeper despite the hurt. However, her interiority occasionally verges on the abstract; her "buried talents" remain a label rather than a concrete, felt capacity, which slightly softens the stakes of their recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict is well-defined by the paradox of "fierce repose." While the arc toward self-forgiveness is earned, the interiority occasionally relies on labeling emotions rather than fully embodying them. The transformation at the end feels slightly too neat, but the core struggle is compelling and grounded in his defining mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads as a vessel for the story's theme rather than a specific, contradictory individual. Phrases like "feeling the price of forgiveness settle like dust on her shoulders" are more abstract summary than embodied emotion. Her final shift from "defiant" to "calm" is asserted but lacks the granular, earned progression of a top-tier character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear, but her internal journey from "uncertain" to "resolved" feels more like a philosophical assertion than an embodied struggle. Her interiority is abstract and often states the theme directly ("even doubts could be forged into purpose"), lacking the specific, contradictory impulses of a character under pressure. The final change in her emotional state is declared rather than fully earned through a crucible of difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The painter’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on abstractions like "intimate aloofness" instead of fully embodying the state through contradictory impulses. While the final emotional shift is legible, the internal conflict feels more stated than dramatized, lacking the granular texture of a mind under pressure. The character reads as a vessel for the theme rather than a complex individual whose flaws drive the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her micro-choices effectively. The interiority is concrete, though phrases like "screaming tenderness surge through her, a fierce love that shouted silently" verge on overwriting an otherwise earned emotional peak. The character's change is legible and scaled appropriately for the story's length, showing a credible progression from hope to validated belief.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The navigator's motivation is stark and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is conveyed through poetic, character-particular imagery ("eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps"). However, the characterization leans heavily on this archetypal, symbolic function, with less evidence of internal contradiction or embodied emotion beyond a resolute sorrow and a final, steady acceptance. A moment of doubt or a more complex emotional reaction under pressure would have elevated this further.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's motivation is clear but articulated in abstract, diagnostic language ("draft a covenant of empathy," "cultivate psychological safety") that undermines a believable interiority. This self-aware, analytical voice feels inconsistent with the grounded role of a "rational truffle forager," making Mara feel more like a thematic vessel than a person. The core contradiction of her character is explained rather than dramatized in moments of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlowe’s motivation is clear and his internal shift from isolated observer to purposeful guardian is well-earned. However, his characterization as "eccentric" is more of a label than a demonstrated trait, and his interiority sometimes uses overt thematic statements ("loneliness not as emptiness but as a canvas") instead of fully embodied emotion, slightly reducing the impact of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is well-established and consistent, rooted in the "lingering promise." However, his transformation from a lonely cataloguer to a fulfilled guide is more summarized than dramatized. The final paragraph explains his new state of being rather than showing it through a concrete, costly choice, which softens the impact of his internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on archetypal labels ("disenchanted," "doubts") rather than specific, embodied emotion. Her ultimate change from disenchanted to tempered feels more magically bestowed by the orb than earned through a difficult, character-defining choice. While functional, the character arc lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction. The character serves as a capable focal point for the story's concepts, but without flaws, blind spots, or a meaningful struggle, the success feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Interiority often relies on summary, as in "felt a surge of directed spontaneity," which labels the feeling rather than embodying it through perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the interiority suffers from being overly diagnostic. Phrases like "the literal manifestation of feral nostalgia" and "Getting jealous of past selves is the method I have chosen" read as authorial explanations of the character's psychology rather than an embodied experience, which flattens the internal conflict into a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her anosmia, which provides a strong, specific lens for her interiority. Her focus on non-olfactory senses is well-realized. The characterization is weakened slightly by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, where her internal state is described with thematic labels ("mapping emotional terrain") rather than purely embodied through her unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s motivation is fierce and clear, driving the entire scene. The internal conflict is present, but its articulation sometimes slips into summary rather than embodied experience (e.g., "Lira felt the stress of her old scars coalescing into light"). The final transformation is earned, but the character's interiority occasionally reads as too self-aware and emotionally tidy for the moment's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("forgiveness was a broken chord") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. This conceptual approach keeps the character at a distance, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's themes than a person experiencing them under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist serves as a functional archetype rather than a developed character. Her motivation is clear but lacks interiority; there are no contradictory impulses or visible struggles that would reveal a unique personality beneath the title of "witness." Emotions like "aching peace" are labeled rather than embodied, making the character a passive vessel for the story's conceptual machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated. The shift from a man of precise, mechanical ritual to a philosophical participant in nature is compelling, yet the realization is stated a bit too plainly ("he realized that clocks measured not time but..."), bordering on diagnostic summary rather than a purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but their interiority relies on abstract, self-analytical labels like "quiet wildfire calm" and "spatially gifted" rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The central philosophical arc, "to understand the physics of letting go," is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible cost. The character's change feels more like the confirmation of a pre-existing philosophy than an earned epiphany forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, reading like a thesis statement ("to widen perspectives responsibly"). Key character traits like "compulsive gambler" and "theoretically rebellious" are labels that don't manifest in meaningful choices or flaws on the page. Her internal conflict is summarized, and the emotional weight of her mother's death feels like an atmospheric overlay rather than a force shaping her actions within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her core philosophy of "cultivated estrangement" is articulated with a degree of authorial distance that borders on diagnostic label-speak. The internal contradiction between isolation and connection is present, but the final epiphany feels more like a conceptual summary than a deeply embodied emotional shift. While her final actions are earned, the interiority sometimes prioritizes thematic clarity over visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks depth and internal conflict. He functions more as a symbolic figure or a vessel for the theme than a complex individual. His emotional state is described with the recurring label "haunted euphoria," which summarizes rather than embodies a contradictory impulse. While his actions are purposeful, he reads as a flawless executor of a mystical duty, missing the blind spots or struggles that create a more compelling character.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, her defining trait of being "desperately jocular" and the concept of "polite anarchy" are more asserted in the setup than dramatized under pressure in the core scene. The character reads as a compelling, well-realized concept, but her internal contradictions don't manifest as difficult micro-choices during the primary action of retrieving the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority tends toward summary rather than embodied experience. The climactic realization feels more like an authorial thesis statement than a character's earned, contradictory emotional state. While her actions are aligned with her goals, she lacks a palpable internal conflict or a moment of genuine struggle that would make her final understanding feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal state, particularly the paradox of being "confidently uncertain," is consistently maintained. However, the motivation remains somewhat abstract, and the character's internal conflict is more described than dramatized through difficult, contradictory choices in the moment. The emotional progression feels slightly too neat, moving from uncertainty to redemptive comfort without a more visceral struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies on archetypes and labels ("whispering advisor," "quietly charismatic") rather than dramatized, contradictory choices. Arlen's motivation to "soothe the souls of those who remembered nothing" is abstract and lacks grounding, making him a vessel for the concept rather than a compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's central contradiction—a tender arsonist—is compelling, and the motivation is clear. The transformation is earned through action. However, interiority sometimes relies on direct labels like "He was analytically intuitive" rather than fully embodying the trait, and the repetition of "volcanic tenderness" slightly dulls its initial impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the action. Her "quietly rebellious" nature is well-demonstrated through the central act of drumming. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction; she is a vessel for a singular, noble purpose, which makes her feel more symbolic than complex. The final understanding she receives from the orb is presented as an epiphany rather than an earned insight hard-won through internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo's motivation is clear and consistently drives the action. However, his characterization lacks depth; he functions more as a flawless executor of a ritual than a person with internal conflict or vulnerability. The description of his laugh as "a sound of calculated spontaneity" is a key instance of a diagnostic label replacing embodied emotion, keeping the character at an intellectual distance from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guardian's motivation is explicit and consistently held, but the character itself functions more as an archetypal vessel for the story's concept than a being with internal conflict. Interiority is abstract ("felt the pulse of unseen stars") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. Characterization remains flat, serving the plot mechanistically without revealing flaws, limits, or a meaningful internal arc beyond fulfilling its stated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks texture. Her interiority is more summarized than embodied, functioning as a serene catalyst for change rather than a person experiencing genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s central conflict is clear—the “combative tenderness” is a promising contradiction. However, the resolution feels more summarized than earned. The shift from internal conflict to “quiet resolve” is stated directly rather than shown through a difficult, embodied choice, and her realization of the crystal’s purpose reads like a diagnostic label delivered mid-crisis, flattening the peak emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and dramatized through her ritualistic actions. However, the interiority occasionally slips into over-articulation, stating her conceptual understanding rather than embodying it. For example, being "aware of the moral grayness" reads more like an authorial summary than a character's immediate thought, slightly flattening the internal conflict into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is conveyed through abstract labels like "inner storm" and a recurring "tremor of certainty" rather than through specific, contradictory impulses shown in scene. While aesthetically fitting, this lacks the granular detail and embodied emotion of a more deeply realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selene's motivation to find beauty in imperfection is clear and consistently drives her actions. However, her interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, thematic pronouncements ("she finally understood that imperfection was the truest melody") rather than maintaining a more embodied, in-the-moment perception. The trait "innocently cunning" is asserted but feels more like a label than a dramatized, contradictory impulse with tangible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bell ringer is a functional archetype whose motivation is clear and consistent. Their defining trait, "powerfully gentle," is demonstrated through action. However, the character lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction, rendering them more of a serene vessel for the story's theme than a complex individual. The dismissal of "grandiose visions" provides a welcome moment of grounded personality, but overall the characterization remains too smooth to be truly compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal journey from desolation to purpose is well-tracked through a series of concrete, ceremonial actions. The emotional progression feels earned, particularly the shift to "subdued ardor." However, moments of interiority sometimes slip into abstract, diagnostic statements ("she understood that the curtains of intention were not literal drapes..."), slightly reducing the immediacy of her embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The cartomancer's motivation is clear and her blend of analytical method and intuitive inheritance creates a compelling internal dynamic. The shift from bearing the "inherited mystery" as a weight to wielding it as a "compass" is an earned and satisfying change, demonstrating a complete arc within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains somewhat abstract. Interiority relies on high-concept labels like "anguished joy" and "steadily unpredictable" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses through action. The character serves the theme effectively but feels more like a vessel for ideas than a complex individual with embodied emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character is a well-realized archetype whose motivation is clear and consistent. His interiority, however, relies on abstract labels like "luminous regret" and "gentle certainty" rather than fully embodied emotion. While his arc from observer to preserver is legible, he lacks the specific flaws or internal contradictions that would elevate him beyond his symbolic function.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract, diagnostic labels like "balance she sought...tugging like a taut string," which states the conflict rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation as a “closure seeker” is clear and consistently drives their actions. The interiority is rich with specific, poetic imagery. However, the character reads as more of a passive participant in a mystical ritual than an agent wrestling with internal conflict; there is little sense of struggle, doubt, or contradictory impulse, which slightly flattens the emotional arc leading to the earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    The crystal gazer’s motivation is abstract but clear and consistently pursued. Her interiority is vivid, though it occasionally dips into familiar phrasing, such as feeling love fill "the empty chambers she had always sensed." While her emotional progression is coherent, the lack of a strong internal contradiction or a moment of genuine doubt makes her journey feel slightly preordained rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dreamer’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is conveyed through elevated, abstract descriptions ("shadowed rapture," "unvoiced poems surge") rather than specific, contradictory, or embodied emotions. The character functions more as a vessel for the theme than a psychologically complex individual, which limits the emotional depth of the final earned rest.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The guard’s motivation is clear, but his characterization operates more at an archetypal level than an individual one. His core trait, "dreamless," is effectively contrasted by the "surge of longing" and "fleeting warmth" at the story's climax. However, this internal shift feels more like a direct result of the external magical event rather than a complex, earned psychological turn rooted in prior contradiction. The character serves the story's beautiful concept well, but lacks the specific, contradictory interiority needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist serves as a passive vessel for thematic ideas rather than a character with discernible internal conflict or agency. His motivation is stated late as a concluding summary ("He realized his motivation..."), not a dramatized want that drives choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("pulse of hope," "sudden freedom") rather than specific, embodied emotion. The final epiphany—"She understood then that..."—is delivered as a summary, feeling more asserted by the narrator than earned through Mira's granular struggle in the moment. The characterization is functional but lacks the contradictory impulses and particularity of a truly compelling protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    The characters function as archetypes, serving the story's atmospheric and thematic goals effectively but lacking individual depth. The bellhop's motivation is inferred through his symbolic actions, while the guests' motivation is stated collectively ("to understand the cost of safety"). This approach sacrifices granular interiority for a more fable-like quality, which is a valid artistic choice but limits the score in a category that rewards specificity and internal contradiction.

    The titan's motivation is clear and consistent, but characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is conveyed through labels like "quiet pride that was both grand and modest" rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. He is a competent executor of the plot, but his defining traits ("diminutive," "regally unpretentious") have little bearing on his choices, which follow a linear, untroubled path to success.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The characters' motivation is clear, but their interiority is expressed through abstract, repeated thematic labels like "periodically eternal" rather than concrete, embodied emotion. Mara and Eli function more as archetypes in service of a concept than as complex individuals with contradictory impulses. Their relationship remains static and functional, lacking the pressure that forges meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her internal state is often described with abstract labels rather than embodied emotion. Phrases like "awkwardly confident in her solitude" and "felt an awkward confidence bloom inside her" are told rather than shown. This diagnostic self-awareness slightly undermines the authenticity of her internal journey, especially at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Anara's motivation is established clearly and her actions are consistent. However, her interiority feels more stated than embodied; phrases like "insurgent spark that still smoldered" serve as labels. The central "sacrifice of memory" is a powerful concept for cost, but its emotional weight is processed in a single sentence, missing an opportunity for deeper, contradictory feeling in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic language like "somatic markers" to label her emotional process. This self-awareness feels more like a clinical summary than an embodied experience of surviving trauma. The epiphany where she articulates her purpose reads as an unearned intellectual conclusion rather than a visceral, contradictory impulse emerging from her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his internal journey is well-realized for this length. However, the interiority occasionally slips into an overly articulate, thesis-like register, as in "Was it not the purpose of every artist to plunge into the shade...?" This slightly flattens the character's voice into a more generic authorial reflection, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael's motivation is singular and powerfully drives the narrative, and his emotional arc from "serene anger" to "purpose" provides a clear throughline. However, his core emotional state is more labeled than embodied; contradictions like "calm fury" are stated rather than demonstrated through conflicting impulses or actions. The character feels slightly subordinate to the concept, functioning as a lens rather than a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maren's motivation is exceptionally clear, but her defining trait, "bravely conflicted," is repeatedly asserted as a label rather than dramatized through her actions. The internal conflict lacks embodiment, reading as a summary of a state rather than a felt, contradictory pressure influencing her choices in the moment. The characterization relies on telling us about her conflict instead of showing it through hesitation, physical reaction, or a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels ("bounty hunter's pacifist daughter") rather than dramatized internal conflict. Her interiority is asserted ("She understood the message") instead of embodied through specific, contradictory perceptions. While her actions align with her stated goal, the lack of any visible struggle or flaw makes her feel more like a vehicle for the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fisher's motivation—a deep "longing"—is clear and consistent, but the "cool-headed" trait is more asserted than demonstrated. His actions are primarily reactive to the garden's mystical guidance rather than emerging from internal conflict or difficult micro-choices. The character serves as an effective vessel for the story's mythic tone, but lacks the psychological depth or contradictory impulses needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is stylistically rich. However, her competence is demonstrated without facing a genuine internal conflict or on-page struggle that tests her values. The final choice to hand over the pen nib is a strong symbolic beat, but the path to it lacks the friction that forges truly compelling characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and potent, serving as a strong anchor. However, her internal process is more asserted than dramatized, relying on labels like "dissonance" and "unwavering resolve." The final shift toward peace feels symbolically potent but lacks the friction of a deeply embodied internal struggle with contradictory impulses shown in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her internal resolution relies on an overly articulate epiphany. The line, “Unlearning, she realized, was not erasing knowledge but shedding the weight of assumptions,” reads more like a thematic summary than an embodied, earned insight, slightly flattening the character’s emotional credibility at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is more of a thematic vessel than a character. His motivation is an abstract concept ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") rather than a deeply felt need, and his internal state is described with diagnostic labels ("retrocognitively trapped") that lack embodied emotion. There is no meaningful internal conflict or difficult choice; he simply intuits the path forward and succeeds without struggle, making the final change feel unearned from a character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ghost's motivation is clear and poignant, effectively conveyed through synesthetic interiority. However, the final resolution is enacted by the shopkeeper, an external agent whose arrival is convenient. While the ghost's arc to earned peace is complete, his agency is diluted at the critical moment, making his ultimate transformation feel slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation as an “affectionate skeptic” is a strong, consistent anchor for her actions. However, her interiority is narrated with an over-reliance on abstract, technical jargon (“somatic markers,” “crystalline geometry”) that feels more like a conceptual summary than an embodied emotional experience. The shift from skeptic to a “conduit for wonder” is asserted in the final paragraphs rather than fully earned through a dramatized internal struggle with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as a skillful vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual. Interiority is poetic but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses; her process unfolds smoothly toward a serene epiphany. The final smile feels a bit too tidy, undercutting the potential cost of her profound realization and the sacrifice of her tool.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but stated abstractly rather than revealed through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Interiority is consistent with the story's lyrical tone, but her progression is linear and lacks the friction of internal conflict. The line "Mara understood her motivation: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is a diagnostic label that summarizes her drive instead of dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation for redemption is clear, but his interiority is articulated in a high literary register that creates distance. The core flaw is the ending's thematic summary, "he understood then that fixing what's broken required both the courage... and the humility...," which reads as a diagnosed conclusion rather than an embodied, contradictory experience. This over-articulation at a peak moment undermines the preceding journey.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    Arlen's motivation to "distill complexity" is clear but abstract, making him feel more like a vessel for the story's theme than a distinct individual. His interiority uses a highly literary register that feels disconnected from the "gloom-hill coachman" persona. The characterization is weakened by the mechanical repetition of traits, such as being "closely attentive," which reads like a label rather than an embodied characteristic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. As a "zen-minded potter," she exhibits no internal conflict, contradiction, or meaningful flaw; she is a serene vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual. The resolution feels pre-ordained by her inherent wisdom, without a sense of genuine struggle or a personal cost that alters her. This one-note portrayal keeps the character from feeling fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in the desire to tend to forgotten spaces. Her interiority, marked by a "protected vulnerability," is shown effectively through her quiet, deliberate actions. However, the use of explicit labels like "wistfully pragmatic care" feels slightly diagnostic, telling the reader her defining trait rather than letting it emerge solely from action, which prevents the characterization from reaching the highest tier of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is explicitly stated but remains an abstract concept rather than an embodied struggle. Her journey lacks meaningful internal conflict; she executes a plan that succeeds without setback or a moment of genuine doubt. The transformation is asserted in the final paragraphs rather than earned through a difficult choice with visible cost, reading more like a philosophical proof than a character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal state lacks sharp contradiction. The journey from seeker to fulfilled keeper is a gentle, linear blossoming rather than a choice forged from conflict. The final realization feels more bestowed by the magical setting than earned through a difficult internal trade-off, softening the impact of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority relies on conceptual labels like "cautiously hopeful surge" rather than embodied emotion. The character arc is legible, but key emotional shifts are summarized ("watched the community’s anxiety dissolve"), which keeps the character at an intellectual distance. This abstract quality prevents the characterization from achieving the highest level of visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character’s core contradiction—a “claustrophobic explorer” with a “prudently adventurous” heart—is established well and dramatized effectively when he pushes into the shifting passage despite his fear. However, the final shift from a personal struggle to a grand, abstract understanding feels more asserted than earned. The line about sparking a rebellion "against the forgetting of stories" is a thematic summary that somewhat flattens the character's specific, embodied experience into a mouthpiece for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s characterization is built on a strong, intriguing concept, but her internal state is often diagnosed rather than embodied. The line "Mara felt a tremor of something she had not felt in years: dormant empathy" is a label that summarizes the core change instead of dramatizing the contradictory, messy experience of it. While her methodical nature and compassion are established, they feel more like declared traits than forces in active, on-page conflict with each other before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is established, but the shift from dread to resolve is slightly undermined by diagnostic language. Her decision to rally the crew by explaining the nail is a "key to a moral compass" feels more like an authorial thesis statement than an authentic, character-driven thought in a moment of crisis, slightly flattening her interiority at a key juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The fiddler's motivation is clear but abstract, established more by narrative assertion ("to sculpt possibility") than by embodied internal conflict. His transition from observer to active agent is the story's core change, but his interiority is often described with recurring labels like "luminous disbelief" rather than shown through contradictory impulses in the moment. The character reads as more of an archetype or vessel for the theme than a specific, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen’s character is consistent and his core trait of "polished calm" is well-established as the filter for his actions. The motivation shifts believably from a passive curiosity to an active, redefined purpose at the end. However, the characterization relies heavily on repeating the label "polished calm" rather than consistently embodying it through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear, but her interiority is more poetic pronouncement than embodied conflict. The shift from doubt to certainty is declared rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or contradictory impulse. She functions as an elegant vessel for the theme, with her competence and struggle feeling somewhat abstract and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The druid's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on archetypal labels ("guarded druid," "warlike serenity") than on demonstrated internal conflict. Her final shift from a "guarded heart" to one "finally open" is asserted rather than earned through a difficult, costly choice. While her actions are consistent, the character functions more as a conduit for the ritual than a complex individual with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, progressing from curiosity to resolve. The emotion of "anxious elation" is a strong anchor that evolves throughout the story. However, the characterization relies more on descriptive labels ("root-bound visionary," "purposefully curious") than on dramatized internal conflict or difficult micro-choices, making her journey feel more like a smooth fulfillment of destiny than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maelia’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies too heavily on repeated abstract labels like "dusky resolve," which appears three times. This repetition makes her interiority feel asserted rather than fully embodied, preventing the character from achieving true specificity beyond her function in the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and the internal conflict between past validation and present shame is well-drawn. However, the character’s final self-awareness is overly articulated. The line "I wrote a final entry in my ledger, noting the day’s lesson..." reads as diagnostic self-analysis rather than an embodied epiphany, slightly flattening an otherwise strong emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her internal arc from haunted ambition to compassionate purpose is legible. The 'kindly methodical' nature is shown through her precise actions. However, the interiority occasionally slips into self-aware diagnostic language, such as when her past climb "transformed into a spiral of magnetic vines," which feels more like a thematic summary than an in-the-moment emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian's motivation is clear and consistent, and the final shift in his understanding of his role feels earned. The character arc is a gentle, philosophical turn rather than a dramatic struggle, which fits the story's tone. However, the internal conflict lacks sharp, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the progression is a smooth, linear realization, which slightly softens the character's complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her character arc feels more conceptual than embodied. The shift from a guarded "inspector" to a "keeper of light" happens abruptly, driven by external events rather than a visible internal struggle with contradictory impulses. Her interiority is expressed in highly polished, abstract metaphors ("a heartbeat paused at the edge of a hesitation") that keep the reader at an emotional distance, preventing a raw, character-particular experience of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority is over-articulated, reading more like a summary of a psychological state than an embodied experience. Lines like "a cartography of the soul that could survive the inevitable erosion" feel too diagnostic and abstract for a moment of crisis. The internal conflict is described rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization is thin, relying on labels over embodied experience. The protagonist and the "veiled dreamer" share a single emotional note, "cautious exuberance," which is stated three times but never credibly dramatized through internal conflict or contradictory action. The veiled dreamer functions more as an elegant prop than a character with agency, her actions limited to opening a latch and delivering a thematic summary at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal conflict feels underdeveloped; she transitions from observer to agent without a palpable struggle. The "mulberry ache" is a strong emotional anchor, but its connection to the envoy feels too convenient, making his climactic change of heart seem unearned. While her actions align with her motives, the characterization lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but the characterization lacks depth. The "beautician mortician" label is evocative but doesn't generate any internal conflict or contradiction on the page; her two roles are perfectly synthesized in the task, making the character feel more like a function of the concept than a person with complex impulses. She is reverent and competent, but without a moment of doubt, struggle, or a contradictory desire, she remains somewhat one-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her stated role as a "committed caretaker." However, her internal state is often conveyed through summary ("a betrayal... that had once shattered her heart") and direct thematic statements ("She understood then that contentment was..."). The character arc is legible but lacks the visceral, embodied struggle that would make the final epiphany feel fully earned rather than intellectually grasped.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s central contradiction, “sincerely insincere,” provides a strong conceptual anchor for her character. However, her interiority is often articulated through abstract metaphor rather than embodied emotion, making her feel more like a function of the theme than a fully realized individual. The magistrate's change is the story's goal, but he remains a symbolic figure rather than a character with demonstrated internal life.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization leans heavily on philosophical interiority rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. She functions effectively as a conduit for the story's themes, but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses of a fully-realized individual under pressure. Her calm resolve is so complete that it limits opportunities to reveal deeper character through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority, while constant, lacks contradiction or specific bias. She reads as an archetype of serene wisdom rather than an individual with complex, conflicting impulses. Phrases like "weathered resolve settle into her marrow" function more as labels than embodied emotion, though the actions leading to this state provide some grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selric’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between self-doubt and purpose is well-drawn. The climactic choice to embrace his own magic is earned through the symbolic act of unstrapping the spellbook. However, the interiority occasionally leans on declarative statements of realization ("he realized the sacred was not...") rather than embodying the shift entirely through perception, which slightly softens the emotional impact of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eli's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The interiority is lyrical and specific, particularly with the concept of "meteor hush." However, the characterization lacks a significant internal conflict or a moment of genuine struggle; his path to fulfillment is direct and unopposed, which makes the final change feel more like an inevitable outcome than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative. However, his interiority, while poetically described with phrases like "stellar doubt," remains largely conceptual. The character arc lacks a moment of visceral, embodied internal contradiction, reading more as a smooth intellectual progression from one state of understanding to another rather than a tangible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her transformation from “heartbroken” to carrier of “quiet certainty” is earned through the central naming ritual. Her grief is well-embodied initially. However, the internal conflict during the process lacks sharp contradiction; she moves through the ritual with a determined grace rather than experiencing significant internal friction or self-doubt on the page, which slightly softens the emotional impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, but his central internal conflict—a "brittle devotion"—is asserted rather than dramatized through a genuine test or moment of doubt. His final realization is stated as a summary ("He realized that..."), which reads as an unearned epiphany rather than an embodied change earned through struggle. While consistent, the characterization relies more on elegant labels than on showing contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    Caitlyn’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization leans on competent execution rather than internal conflict. Her core trait, "precisely humane," is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice. While her final "calm certainty" is earned by the plot, the lack of an on-page struggle or contradictory impulse keeps her from feeling fully complex.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Selene's motivation is exceptionally clear, and her actions are consistent. However, the internal conflict between her scholarly discipline and secret sentimentality is stated more than it is dramatized. While the memory of fireflies provides a touchstone, the conflict doesn't force a difficult trade-off or create a moment of genuine struggle in-scene; the process reads more like a flawless execution of a plan than a crucible that tests her contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character is a consistent archetype, and his motivation to preserve trust is clear. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels like "watcher's burden" and "metaphorical weight of responsibility" rather than showing contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. This keeps the character at an archetypal distance, preventing a deeper, more particularized connection.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, but his internal conflict is articulated through abstract labels ("calm and fury," "compassion and resolve") rather than embodied in contradictory actions. The character arc relies on diagnostic self-awareness ("He understood that defeating emotional numbness required...") which flattens the emotional experience of the climax into a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to create the unique escape room. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing; the "quiet triumph" she feels at the end is a label that summarizes the emotion rather than embodying it. While her actions are well-motivated, her internal landscape lacks the specific, contradictory texture that would elevate her from a functional protagonist to a compelling one.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conductor’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively embodied by the “mournfully eager” attribute. However, the character functions more as a singular, poetic vessel for the theme than a person with complex, contradictory impulses acting in-scene. The internal conflict is labeled rather than dramatized through difficult choices, which slightly flattens the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The guardian's motivation is clear and consistent, but its characterization leans heavily on abstract labels ("dimensionally homesick," "feral") that are not fully embodied in its actions. The internal conflict is present but often articulated through direct thematic summary rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final shift from "guardian" to "curator" is a valid change, though it feels more like a conceptual re-labeling than an earned transformation born from visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his primary traits—"hopeless" and "stoically sensitive"—are more asserted than embodied through contradictory choices under pressure. His interiority is conveyed through labels and summaries rather than a granular, moment-to-moment struggle. The transformation from hopeless to purposeful is legible but feels preordained by the story's conceptual framework rather than earned through a deeper internal battle.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    Selin is more of a competent functionary than a complex character. Her motivation, "to find the beginning in every ending," is clear and consistent but lacks any internal contradiction or friction; she encounters no meaningful self-doubt or difficult trade-offs. Her defining trait is her professional pragmatism, which allows her to succeed without a palpable struggle, making the final earned change feel more like a successful procedure than a personal transformation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lio’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. The core trait, “resiliently positive,” is stated rather than demonstrated under pressure; we see no internal conflict or moments of doubt that would make his resolve feel earned. He functions more as a necessary agent for the plot's magical system than a complex individual whose choices carry a personal, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype, an agent of the plot rather than a complex individual. His motivation is clear and consistent, but his "unsettlingly calm" demeanor flattens any potential for internal conflict or embodied emotional response to the wonders he creates. Characterization serves the concept but lacks the depth, contradiction, or vulnerability expected at this level; he feels more like a lens than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on telling over showing. Phrases like "balancedly curious, a rare temperament" are labels rather than embodied traits demonstrated through a difficult choice. Her interiority feels more like a summary of a state than a lived experience of contradiction or struggle, which flattens the emotional stakes of the successful test.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to be a "contact tracer for hearts" is established but remains an abstract professional label rather than a deeply felt personal drive. Interiority is consistent but lacks contradiction; the character is a competent and sensitive vessel for the plot. The reflection on "incidental heroism" reads as an unearned authorial diagnosis, reducing the character's complexity to a thematic tag.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The character’s core contradiction—a claustrophobic spelunker—is compelling and receives closure. Her motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. The final emotional shift feels slightly abrupt, more symbolic than fully dramatized, but is effective for the story's length and resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is over-articulated, relying on summary rather than embodied emotion. Key realizations are stated as intellectual conclusions ("she realized," "she knew the wisdom"), which undercuts the emotional core. The character's core drive is solid, but the execution lacks the nuance and contradiction expected for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The storyteller’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, he functions more as a mythic archetype or a vessel for the story's concept than a character with palpable internal conflict. While his actions are decisive, he exhibits a near-flawless competence that lessens the sense of personal struggle; the story’s tension comes from the cosmic task, not from any internal contradiction or doubt within him.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives the central action, but the characterization remains somewhat abstract. Interiority is stated more than embodied; the critical shift from bitterness to lightness is summarized ("I felt the bitterness inside me loosen") rather than dramatized through a more visceral, contradictory internal experience. The character serves the powerful concept effectively but reads more as a lens for the theme than a uniquely flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The violinist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is summarized with conceptual labels like "longing" and being "in the gap between knowing and understanding" rather than dramatized through embodied emotion or internal conflict. His actions are symbolic, but he lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate him beyond a vessel for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Milo's motivation is clear but articulated with abstract, authorial distance rather than embodied interiority. Lines like "He knew that broken promises could only heal..." function as thematic summary, not character-specific thought under pressure. His core action is consistent, but the internal conflict remains at a philosophical level, slightly flattening the emotional stakes of his "respectfully rebellious" stance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara is an archetype, not a character. Her motivation, "to interpret silence as possibility," is stated and pursued without internal conflict, flaws, or contradiction. She is a vessel for the story's theme rather than a person experiencing it; her actions are consistent but lack the texture of a lived inner life, making her journey feel more like a beautiful, pre-ordained ritual than a struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a consistent and well-realized character, but she functions more as a calm, competent facilitator than a protagonist under pressure. Her motivation is clear and her actions align with it, but the story lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or a difficult choice. Her "quiet stewardship" is beautifully rendered, but without a contradictory impulse tested in a key beat, the characterization remains evocative rather than deeply compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and poetically established, but her characterization lacks significant internal contradiction demonstrated through on-page choices. She is more a vessel for the story's lyrical concept than a character with complex, conflicting impulses under pressure. The introduction of Lio serves as a thematic mirror rather than a relationship that forces a crucible-like choice, keeping the characterization evocative but emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The locksmith's motivation is clear but abstract, serving more as a thematic function than a deeply felt personal drive. Interiority relies on labels like "faint longing" and "unsteady yet resonant" voice without showing contradictory impulses in action. The character reads as a mythic archetype, a vessel for the story's concept, lacking the specific flaws or internal conflict that would make his "unassumingly bold" nature feel earned rather than stated.

    The folklorist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority feels more like a vehicle for the story's theme than a distinct personality. Phrases like "When habits break, old rituals dissolve..." sound like authorial thesis statements, not embodied thought. While her actions are purposeful, the character herself lacks a compelling internal conflict or flaw that complicates her mission, rendering her more of a capable functionary than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character’s motivation is clear and her central contradiction—"combative tenderness"—is a strong concept. Her nervous habit of walking backwards provides good physical embodiment, and its cessation marks a clear shift. However, her internal journey from nervousness to confidence feels somewhat declared rather than fully earned through a struggle with a tangible obstacle, making the transition feel a bit too smooth for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pruner’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks depth. He functions more as a noble archetype than a person with internal contradictions or flaws; his wisdom and creativity are stated but not tested through a difficult trade-off or mistake. While his reverence is embodied well initially ("hands trembling"), he remains a static figure of perfect competence, which limits emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interior state of "lucid unrest" is a specific and compelling rendering of professional focus under pressure. However, she functions more as a mythic archetype or a vessel for the ritual than a character with deep internal contradictions. The characterization serves the story’s potent atmosphere flawlessly but lacks the granular, contradictory impulses that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on repeated, abstract labels like "shielded openness." This phrase, used as both an internal feeling and an external vocal quality, functions more as a thematic signpost than an embodied, contradictory emotion. The character acts as a competent and sensitive vessel for the story's concept but lacks the specific, flawed interiority that would elevate her beyond her function.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mort's motivation is clear but primarily intellectual, serving as a vessel for the story's theme. His interiority is overly articulate and philosophical, culminating in a diagnostic summary ("tension minus attachment equals...") rather than a fully embodied, contradictory emotional experience. The character reads more as a thoughtful observer executing a premise than a person grappling with an internal crisis, which limits the emotional depth of his final "release."

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The balladeer's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. His actions, particularly the final choice to encode his own longing, demonstrate a clear arc and fulfill the story's purpose. However, the characterization remains somewhat archetypal; interiority is expressed through poetic but abstract states like "driftingly alert" rather than through specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate him beyond his symbolic function.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies heavily on abstract labels like "affectionate detachment" rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. He functions more as a thoughtful vessel for the theme than a complex individual facing a genuine struggle. The absence of any flaw or contradictory impulse makes his journey feel predetermined and emotionally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal arc toward a resolved purpose is well-drawn. However, her interiority occasionally becomes too self-aware and articulate, stating her own motive in language that reads more like the story's thesis statement than an organic, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, and her core limit—face blindness—is well-established as the catalyst for her artistic focus. Her competence is balanced with this struggle, making her actions feel earned. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into thematic summary, as in "she felt that discovering limits was a gift," which reads more like an authorial thesis than an embodied, in-the-moment realization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her trait of being "diligently curious." However, her interiority lacks significant conflict or contradiction; she proceeds through the puzzle with anticipation and pride, but without struggle or a difficult trade-off. The characterization is functional and suits the story's focus on discovery, but it remains emotionally straightforward without the complexity needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The locksmith's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on embodied clichés ("fingers trembling," "breath as heavy as fog") rather than character-particular conflict. While his actions are decisive, he lacks contradictory impulses; his journey feels more like a solemn execution of a known ritual than a struggle. The final emotional note of "driftwood nostalgia" is evocative but would land with more force if preceded by a more complex internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization is one-dimensional and lacks the internal conflict necessary for literary depth. Both Liora and the villagers are uniformly altruistic and cooperative, without contradictory impulses or flaws. The ghost's "surge of trust" is an unearned emotional beat, as there was no prior evidence of her distrust; this flattens any potential for a meaningful character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on repeating the phrase “bruised awe,” rendering her emotional state more of a label than an embodied experience. Her final realization that “beauty lay in being beautifully flawed” feels like an unearned, author-imposed theme statement rather than a character-specific change emerging from the scene’s pressure. The characterization lacks the specific, contradictory impulses expected at this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is superb, characterized by a compelling blend of reluctance and duty. The motivation—a bargain—is established efficiently, while the internal conflict culminates in the complex, earned feeling of "graceless beauty" and "bitter sweetness." The character's contradictory impulses are embodied in the act of performing a ritual that feels like a "wound" yet serves as a "miracle," satisfying the highest standard for characterization at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation to atone for a professional failure is clear and consistent. Her interiority is well-realized through the specific lens of a "symphonically minded" chemist, which avoids generic internal monologue. However, the emotional arc is slightly too neat; the resolution of her grief and that of her colleagues feels overly swift and tidy ("their own grief loosening"), lacking the friction of contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The vendor’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks depth. He functions more as a serene instrument for the story's concept than an individual with internal conflict or embodied emotion. His actions are logical but feel pre-ordained, and the final passing of the torch to the child resolves his arc without a deeply felt cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lir's motivation is clear and his interiority is rendered with unique sensory detail, particularly the synesthetic experience of taste. His competence is well-established, but the characterization lacks a deeper layer of internal conflict or contradiction; he functions more as a skilled artisan performing a known ritual than a character struggling with the weight of his task. The absence of a personal stake or a moment of doubt keeps him slightly at a distance, preventing a truly exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    The librarian's motivation is clear and consistent, but she reads more as a flawless archetype than a person. The lack of internal conflict, struggle, or any meaningful obstacle makes her actions feel predetermined. The repetition of descriptive phrases like "empathetically decisive" and "vigorous tender" acts as a label, telling us her qualities rather than demonstrating them through a difficult choice with tangible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as a strong anchor. However, her core traits like "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" are asserted rather than demonstrated through her actions or a uniquely structured thought process, which reads as quite linear. The characterization is functional but lacks the deep interior contradiction or embodied emotion that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot forward. The internal journey is mapped through the "latent blaze" metaphor, which shows a distinct progression. However, the repeated use of this exact phrase and others like "seeds of vigilance" feels more like labeling an emotion rather than embodying it, slightly reducing the depth of the character's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    Auris's motivation is clear but remains a high-concept ideal rather than an embodied need. His interiority consists of thematic statements like "he believed empathy in motion could be heard," which reads more like authorial assertion than character-particular thought. The story lacks a moment of internal conflict or doubt; he is a flawless executor of a beautiful idea, which makes him more of a vessel for the theme than a complex individual. The characterization is consistent but lacks the friction of genuine struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.7)
    The tutor's motivation is clear and his internal state is palpable. However, the repeated use of the exact phrase "hopeful melancholy" functions as a diagnostic label, slightly flattening the emotional complexity it aims to portray. The character feels more intuitively guided than "thoughtfully precise," creating a minor gap between the stated trait and his demonstrated actions.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is expressed through lush description rather than contradictory impulses or embodied emotion; phrases like "trembling like a stage actor awaiting applause" externalize feeling into performance. The final shift from solitary quester to teacher is legible, but the character reads more as a sincere vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction; her ambition and desire for serenity are presented as a compatible pair rather than a source of genuine internal conflict. We are told she wants to "cultivate serenity within motion," but we never see her struggle with impatience or have her ambition threaten her goal. The character serves as a flawless vehicle for the theme rather than a complex individual whose flaws complicate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but she functions more as a competent vehicle for discovery than a character with internal conflict. Her interiority consists of observations and realizations rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The final epiphany feels more like an intellectual summary ("She knew the source of resilience was... a cultural memory") than an earned, visceral change in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a competent and focused professional, but her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction. Her final action—whispering a "quiet command to the invisible forces"—feels tonally dissonant with the established "accident investigator" persona, creating a late-game wobble between scientific procedure and magical thinking. The character serves the concept well but feels more like a lens than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character is more of a symbolic vessel than a person with compelling interiority. Her motivation to "certify wonder" is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices. While her perception is described as unique (synesthesia), it functions as a stylistic filter rather than a source of genuine struggle or trade-offs, making her feel one-dimensional and archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions as a relic keeper are specific and purposeful. However, her interiority leans toward the abstract ("texture of possibility," "weight of unfinished cycles") rather than the embodied. The pivotal epiphany—"Her mission, now clear..."—is delivered as a diagnostic statement, which lessens its impact compared to a more dramatized or contradictory internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action in the narrative. The interiority is rich with specific, conceptual language that defines her worldview. However, the internal conflict reads more as a focused, intellectual pursuit than a struggle between contradictory impulses; the progression toward her goal feels almost seamless, lacking the friction of a deeply embodied personal cost until the final, transformative moment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The courier's motivation to honor his mentor is clear and consistent, driving his actions with the shepherd and the girl. However, his characterization lacks significant internal conflict; he is a vessel for the theme of wonder without much personal struggle or contradictory impulse shown on the page. The defining trait "jittery" is stated but doesn't complicate his choices or create any tangible cost, rendering it more of a label than an embodied crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and compelling, but her central internal conflict between empiricism and mysticism is more asserted than dramatized. Her actions are consistently those of a mystic, making the "firmly grounded in empirical study" trait feel like a label rather than a force that complicates her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization remains subordinate to the story's lyrical concept. Her interiority is asserted rather than embodied; the declaration "She felt a latent sacrifice settle in her bones" is a label for a feeling, not a dramatized moment of contradictory impulse or choice. She functions more as a necessary agent for the mythic ritual than a character with complex, conflicting desires under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blacksmith's motivation is clear and his pivotal choice—bartering a specific, painful memory—is a strong moment of characterization. The transformation from "meek" to a "silent sentinel" is earned through this action. However, interiority is occasionally stated with labels like "his mind a twin horizon of hope and doubt" or the blossoming of "sturdy hope," which slightly lessens the embodied feel of his internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority lacks compelling contradiction. The choice at the climax, driven by a "sudden compulsion," feels more like a narrative requirement than an earned, difficult decision arising from internal conflict. While her professional skills are well-defined, her emotional progression reads as a smooth, linear path to a predictable moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marek's motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" is clear and consistently drives his actions. The shift from a personal need to a communal promise is earned through the ritual. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into telling, as with the phrase "Marek felt a surge of purpose," which slightly undermines the otherwise strong embodiment of his character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in her final vow. However, her interiority sometimes relies on thematic labels like feeling her purpose “pulse like a heartbeat” rather than more specific, embodied contradictions. The Storm Herald functions more as a mythic catalyst than a character with independent agency, limiting the potential for relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear but her interiority remains abstract and decorative. The story states her watchfulness but doesn't dramatize it through choices made under pressure. The final epiphany arrives via an external source—the scroll—rather than being earned through internal struggle or a difficult decision, making her character arc feel passive and her change unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal state lacks significant contradiction. While his sorrow connects him to the grid, his competence and patience are never seriously challenged, making his journey feel more like a procedural success than a struggle. The motivation "to discover what trees witness" feels abstract and less integrated than the immediate goal of healing sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear, but her characterization remains archetypal. Her interiority is expressed through lyrical description rather than embodied conflict or contradictory impulses. The final realization that "the true alchemy was... in weaving together the hearts of all who listened" feels like a thematic summary delivered to the reader, rather than a psychologically earned epiphany for the character, which flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The recluse's motivation is clear, but his primary traits—compassion and empathy—are stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. His internal conflict is articulated in summary ("a delicate dance of staying while leaving") instead of being shown through contradictory actions under pressure. The resolution feels more like a diagnosis ("he realized that staying while leaving...was a metaphor") than an earned, embodied change forged in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistently drives his actions, from the guerrilla gardening to the final ritual with the bread. His interiority is specific, centered on a yearning for meaning in decay. However, the emotional state is sometimes declared with abstract labels like "tenuous absolution" rather than fully embodied, which slightly lessens the impact of his quiet reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chief’s motivation is clear and her core trait, "gently meticulous," is well-dramatized through her actions. The shift from duty to "personal pilgrimage" is a strong anchor for her interiority. However, the connection to her "own childhood" remains an abstract label; a more concrete sensory detail or flicker of memory would have deepened this crucial link, preventing it from feeling like a slightly unearned declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's competence is well-demonstrated through action, but her core motivation is articulated with jarring, abstract lyricism ("to capture the sound of trust breaking, a brittle note that once echoed in her father's lullabies"). This reads as a diagnostic label or thematic summary inserted into a moment of crisis, creating a fissure between the practical, grounded character we see and the overly poetic interiority we are told. This lack of integration prevents an otherwise solid character from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his final internal shift—realizing his own aura is a "quiet storm"—provides a strong concluding character beat. However, the transition from "skeptic" to "awed" feels somewhat summarized rather than fully dramatized. The internal conflict is present but could have been embodied with more friction before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("fractured inspiration," "knot of suppressed ideas") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The character arc is legible but lacks the granular texture of a top-tier piece; the resolution feels more like a conceptual shift than a deeply earned internal struggle. Competence outweighs visible struggle, making the final victory feel somewhat preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The calligrapher's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot forward. However, her interiority is thin; she functions more as a vehicle for the theme than a character with palpable internal conflict. Her journey from determination to success is emotionally linear, lacking the contradictory impulses or moments of genuine struggle that would elevate her from an archetype to an individual.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The tuner's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is expressed through abstract concepts like "color of wonder" rather than concrete, contradictory impulses. He exists in a single, unwavering emotional state, which fits the story's meditative tone but lacks the depth and internal conflict expected for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.5)
    Vira’s motivation to resolve her "inner static" is established, but the execution remains abstract. Her choices feel more like symbolic gestures than decisions with tangible costs or contradictory impulses acting in-scene. The resolution, a "fragmented wholeness," is asserted rather than embodied through a difficult choice; the story tells us she feels calm rather than dramatizing an action that costs her something to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation is explicitly stated ("to prove that listening heals") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or a tangible personal history. While her actions are consistent, her interiority relies on recurring labels like "sandstorm calm" instead of specific, contradictory emotional embodiment. Her character arc is a smooth progression toward a pre-stated goal, lacking the friction of genuine internal conflict or flawed choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Selene's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains more of a beautiful, abstract concept than a person with tangible internal conflict. While her actions align with her motives, her interiority is presented through declarative, poetic statements rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The line "encrypting vulnerability as strength was a pact with herself" functions as a thematic label, holding the reader at arm's length from any genuine, messy struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's motivation is clearly established and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her specific actions, like using the wildflowers, are well-rooted in her character's established habits. However, her interiority occasionally serves the story's theme more than it reveals a complex, contradictory individual; the pivotal realization reads more like a neat summary of the story's concept than a messy, embodied epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The summoner's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She operates as a flawless instrument for the ritual, exhibiting competence without any visible internal conflict, contradiction, or struggle. This emotional and tactical perfection makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and deepens effectively from a transactional goal to a relational one. Liora is a compelling, if archetypal, guide. The primary weakness is the narrator's final realization, which is slightly over-articulated ("the purpose of my quest became clear"), shifting from embodied interiority to a summary of the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear but entirely abstract, articulated through diagnostic label-speak like "translate isolation into independence" rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Her defining trait, "charmed skeptic," is abandoned after the first sentence and never influences a choice. The final transformation feels more like a conceptual assertion than an earned emotional shift rooted in a specific, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal state lacks genuine contradiction. Her journey from burdened forger to resolved artist is a smooth, linear progression rather than a struggle between competing impulses. The resolution feels more declared than earned, lacking a moment where a different, more difficult choice was a tangible possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is established clearly and drives her actions consistently. However, she functions more as an archetypal vessel for the story's theme than a complex individual. There is a lack of meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is one of serene, if melancholy, discovery rather than a struggle that forces a difficult choice with a high personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains largely conceptual. She functions as an archetype—a vessel for the story's lyrical ideas—rather than a person with embodied emotions or internal contradictions. Interiority is expressed through abstract metaphors ("borrowed starlight now solidified in her veins") instead of concrete, sensory experience, which keeps the reader at an analytical distance from her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The philosopher's motivation is clear and consistent, but he functions more as an archetypal vessel for the theme than a character with compelling internal contradictions. The mention of mending a "torn strand of his own memory" offers a hint of deeper interiority, but it remains an abstraction that is not dramatized or given specific weight, leaving the characterization feeling more intellectual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions effectively. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; her journey from debunker to protector feels more like a logical progression than a difficult, earned transformation. Her interiority is competent but leans toward summarizing realizations rather than embodying contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The visionary's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives his actions, but the characterization remains archetypal. While his loneliness is stated, his interiority lacks specific, contradictory impulses; he reads as a steadfast vessel for the story's concept rather than a complex individual. The absence of internal conflict or embodied emotion beyond a determined resolve keeps the characterization functional but not deeply compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's character is consistent in his wistful sensibility, but his motivation feels externally granted ("whispered by the dunes") rather than internally generated from conflict. His transformation from vagrant to translator is a smooth fulfillment rather than a struggle, and his interiority, while lyrical, relies on asserted emotional states ("felt the weight of centuries lift") instead of embodied, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her core trait—being “logically emotional”—is more asserted than dramatized. The narrative states she wrestles with a paradox, but her actions proceed along a purely logical path without any visible internal friction or costly trade-off. The final tear being a “logical acknowledgment” is an attempt to fuse these traits, but it reads as an intellectual summary rather than an earned, embodied emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal conflict relies more on thematic statements than embodied contradiction. The epiphany—"the patient revolution was not a battle but a gentle untying of the knots"—is a diagnostic summary that explains the change rather than dramatizing the struggle. This reliance on abstract self-awareness slightly undermines the earnedness of her final, calmer state.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on self-diagnosing, abstract labels like "fortified vulnerability" and "watchfully calm." While her professional competence is demonstrated, the internal conflict feels more stated than dramatized; contradictory impulses aren't shown acting in the same moment. The character arc from empirical observer to participant in a legacy of resistance is earned by the final action, but the emotional language is often too tidy and articulated for a high-pressure situation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chaplain's motivation is clear, but his characterization relies more on archetypal traits ("kindness that seemed oddly out of place") than on embodied, contradictory impulses. The internal conflict over "tampering with a symbol of repentance" is resolved without a visible trade-off or difficult choice, softening the character's arc into a smooth epiphany rather than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific trait of "mischievous wonder." Her actions, from whispering a joke to the gears to pursuing an unheard sound, align perfectly with this core. The characterization is strong in its unified voice and purpose, but it lacks the internal, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a scene that would elevate it to an exceptional tier. Her drive is singular, not conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lia's motivation is clear and escalates believably from professional curiosity to a personal sense of duty. Her core actions, like fabricating the tribute, align perfectly with her role and intellect. The transition from "abstract curiosity" to "a lifeline to those lost voices" feels slightly declared rather than fully embodied in the moment, preventing a top-tier score, but her competence and purpose are otherwise well-drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character is more of a functionary executing a ritual than a person with discernible internal conflict. Her motivation is established ("whispered call," "unspoken hopes"), but her interiority relies on labels like "calmly intuitive" rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic choice to "map empathy onto action" is an asserted theme, not a difficult decision arising from competing impulses demonstrated in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but the transformation feels more like a sudden, poetic epiphany than a change earned through visible internal struggle. Interiority is articulate but verges on diagnostic self-awareness, stating the emotional state rather than fully embodying its contradictions. The final shift in purpose is powerful but the causal steps leading to it feel somewhat compressed and asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The sentinel's motivation is stated as an abstract thesis ("to nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than shown as a deeply felt, personal need. His internal state is described with diagnostic labels like "patient cool" instead of being embodied through specific, contradictory impulses. While his final change is clear, the interiority reads more like an analysis of a character than the experience of one.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Keeper is a consistent archetype, but his characterization lacks significant internal conflict. His motivation is clear, but his final realization ("He understood his purpose now") feels more like an assertion of change than a concretely earned shift born from struggle. The character serves the theme effectively but remains more of a vessel for ideas than a person with contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth and internal conflict. She functions more as a symbolic figure or a catalyst for the story's concept than a fully realized individual. Her defining trait, being "perceptively calm," is asserted but never tested, and her interiority lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that create a compelling character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her internal arc from a reticent observer to an active participant in history's continuum is well-defined. The core change from "weathered innocence" to "quiet resolve" provides a solid emotional spine. However, the reliance on these precise, repeated labels feels slightly declarative, abstracting the emotion rather than fully embodying it through her immediate perceptions and micro-choices in the scene.

    The prophet’s motivation is clear and compellingly paradoxical (“precognitively forgetful”), driving his quest with a tangible internal conflict. His interiority is rich, though the poetic self-awareness sometimes dilutes the sense of embodied emotion. The final action—inscribing the chalk dust—is a well-earned culmination of his desire to leave a trace against the tide of forgetting, showing a credible endurance of his core self.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sage is a compelling archetype, and his motivation is clear and consistent. His interiority is effectively embodied by the "luminous ache." However, he lacks a significant internal contradiction or flaw; his "changelessly constant" nature makes him a masterful figure but slightly less complex, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear but her characterization is flat, functioning more as a serene archetype than a person with internal friction. Her competence is absolute, leaving no room for struggle or contradictory impulses. Phrases like "decisively kind grace" are labels that are asserted rather than dramatized through a choice with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her "quietly deliberate" nature. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction or internal conflict. The character arc is a straightforward path to discovery without the deeper struggle or complex trade-offs that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation to redeem mistakes is clear and consistent, driving the central action. Her interiority, however, relies heavily on recurring labels like "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" rather than showing these contradictory impulses fully in scene. The repetition of "shrewdly innocent" (three times) acts as a tag rather than an evolving trait, slightly flattening the character arc into a performance of a concept.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract labels like "pearl of stillness" rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. She functions more as a serene archetype executing a plan than a character wrestling with a choice in the present moment. The final realization feels less like an earned epiphany and more like a tidy summary of the story's theme, lacking the messiness of genuine internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, but her interiority feels overly articulate and diagnostic. Phrases like "felt a protected vulnerability rise within her" state the emotional endpoint rather than embodying the contradictory process of arriving there. This self-awareness undercuts the sense of genuine struggle, making the character’s emotional arc feel more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The novelist's motivation is clear and consistent, and her final shift to "conflicted yet resolute" is earned within the story's allegorical frame. However, the characterization relies heavily on the label "conflicted" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The interiority, while poetically rendered, remains at a uniform, abstract pitch, missing an opportunity for more granular, embodied emotional texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She functions as a flawless conduit for the ritual, exhibiting purpose but no internal conflict, contradiction, or tangible struggle. The label "whimsical tinkerer" feels mismatched with her solemn, priestly actions, reading more like an initial concept than an embodied trait that influences her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is a vessel for the story's theme of patient craft, embodying reverence and resolve without dramatized doubt or struggle. While her final realization feels earned within the story's lyrical frame, her interiority reads as a single, sustained note of purpose rather than a complex mind grappling with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corin’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "reflective locksmith" persona. His interiority is well-maintained, particularly in the final paragraph's consideration of the central paradox. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; he operates with a serene competence that, while fitting the tone, reduces dramatic tension and limits character depth to that of a patient, archetypal craftsman.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The fractal weaver is a compelling archetype whose motivation is crystal clear and consistently expressed through action. However, characterization is limited by a lack of interiority beyond her singular purpose. We see no internal conflict, contradiction, or flaw; she is a perfect instrument for the ritual, which makes her feel more like a mythic figure than a complex individual, capping the score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal journey is palpable. However, her interiority sometimes veers into overly articulate, diagnostic self-awareness, as when she thinks of grief as a "paradox that she now sought to honor." The emotional arc is earned, but a touch more contradiction and less tidy conceptualization would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is sharp and compelling, with a clear internal conflict between her eroded ambition and the need for resolution. The negotiation with the ghost provides a strong crucible for her character. The final choice to carry stories forward is an earned renunciation of her old self, landing with a felt cost. A minor weakness is that her "chronologically confused" state feels more like a label for the mood than a trait that actively complicates her choices in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character is more of an archetype than an individual, defined by labels like "curious," "functionally creative," and "stoic wonder" rather than through demonstrated internal conflict. Her motivation to "resurrect hope" is clear but abstract, and her path to success is frictionless, which prevents any deeper revelation of character under pressure. She acts as a capable vehicle for the theme, but her interiority lacks contradiction or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-established, moving from the dream as an intimidating "bear" to a reconciled "quiet friend." The change is earned through the central action of inscribing the crystal. However, the interiority sometimes relies on telling ("He felt the abandoned dream settle into his chest") rather than fully embodying the shift, slightly softening the emotional impact at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's motivation is clear but his interiority is articulated through repetitive, abstract labels ("thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval") rather than embodied emotion. The final change feels more like a thematic summary than an earned, character-driven shift. His defining traits are stated but not sufficiently dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, characterization remains somewhat static; he is a vessel for the theme of preservation rather than a figure with palpable internal conflict. His defining trait, patience, is demonstrated but never truly tested against an opposing impulse on the page, making him feel more archetypal than individual. The piece lacks a moment where contradictory desires create friction before the final, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The traveler's motivation is clear and consistent, but the character functions more as an archetypal vessel for the theme than a person with compelling internal contradictions. His shift from "lonesome splendor" to "quiet hope" is asserted in the final moments rather than earned through a dramatized internal struggle. The characterization is elegant but lacks the friction of a difficult, on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prince’s motivation is clear and his arc from bedraggled to radiant is earned through his central action. However, his core flaw is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene. The final transformation is slightly weakened by summary, as when the story states "The prince felt his own flaw melt away," which reports the change rather than embodying it in a final, complex perception.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira's motivation is clear, but her interiority feels overly articulate and diagnostic, stating the story's themes rather than embodying a contradictory struggle. Emotions are described with poetic labels ("unyielding compassion like a lantern") instead of being dramatized through conflicting impulses in the scene. The change feels predetermined rather than earned through a difficult, on-page choice with ambiguous costs.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear, but her core trait as a "luminous skeptic" is asserted rather than dramatized. Her actions—diligently following mystical symbols—read more as a believer's ritual than a skeptic's investigation, which flattens the internal conflict. The final change is stated in an explicit summary ("skepticism now tempered") rather than earned through a choice that demonstrates a costly shift in her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, and her identity as a "sentimentalist" is well-supported by her actions. The final choice to release the gear feels earned within the story's lyric logic. However, the characterization lacks significant internal contradiction; she feels the weight of her task but never truly doubts her path, which keeps her slightly archetypal rather than deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eliam’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization serves the story's lyrical concept more than it reveals a complex interiority. He is a receptive vessel for the plot's events, lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected in top-tier work. The final earned understanding feels more like a reward for patience than the result of a difficult, costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but abstract, defined by labels like “ethically diligent” rather than embodied internal conflict. Her interiority reads as thematic summary (“stitch the frayed tapestry of time”) instead of a specific, personal experience, making her feel more like a symbolic vessel than a complex individual. There are no contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices; she is a functionary of the plot's devotional act.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The gardener's motivation is clear and consistent, and his arc from seeking to understanding is legible. However, the character feels more like a graceful vessel for the story's theme than a person with distinct, contradictory impulses. The stated "blithe" nature is asserted at the beginning and end but doesn't feel fully integrated into the somber, ritualistic action of the main scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartographer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization remains abstract. He serves as a vehicle for the story's concept rather than a person with embodied emotions or internal contradictions. The final realization—"humbled by his own ignorance"—is stated as an intellectual summary, an unearned epiphany that lacks the weight of a dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. Her "thistled calm" is asserted rather than tested; she faces no internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses on the page. The final state of "quiet pride" is a simple affirmation, achieved without a struggle that would make it feel more deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character is a compelling archetype, and her motivation is clear and consistent. However, her interiority relies more on stated purpose than on dramatized internal conflict. The final realization, "true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling," borders on diagnostic self-awareness rather than an embodied emotional state, slightly weakening the earned nature of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the internal conflict is well-defined. However, the character sometimes feels more like a mouthpiece for the story's philosophy than a fully embodied individual. Phrases like "My rebellion is rationally rebellious, a paradox I cherish" come across as overly diagnostic, abstracting the character's inner state rather than showing it through more concrete, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on elegant labels like "expectantly resigned" rather than dramatized internal conflict. Her primary role is to serve as a catalyst for the theme, and her interiority feels more like authorial summary than embodied thought. The change from resigned to feeling a "quiet thrill" is present but lacks the texture of a deep, contradictory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on the archetypal "informally wise" sage than on embodied internal conflict. While her actions are purposeful, her interiority lacks contradiction; she proceeds with a serene competence that feels pre-determined rather than earned through struggle in the moment. The tasting of "childhood, loss, and hope" is a strong beat, but the emotional cost of processing this collective trauma remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, but her defining trait—being “involuntarily truthful”—is underutilized. It's stated as a burden but never forces a costly choice or complicates her actions within the primary scene. Her internal state feels more summarized than embodied, particularly the moment of realization, which reads as a neat intellectual summary rather than a complex emotional shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but their characterization is more of a philosophical stance than an embodied presence. Interiority is overly articulate, explaining emotions and epiphanies rather than dramatizing them through contradictory impulses. The final change from observer to catalyst is stated directly ("I realized that my role...") rather than earned through a struggle with a visible cost, making the transformation feel more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The statue’s motivation is a static, declared purpose ("to welcome nuance") rather than a complex, unfolding drive. Its interiority remains abstract and lacks the contradictory impulses necessary for high-band characterization; it functions more as a graceful allegorical figure than a character grappling with a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aric's motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling philosophical shift, but the characterization remains somewhat abstract. His core trait as a "grim optimist" is asserted more than it is dramatized through contradictory impulses in a moment of choice. The internal conflict is articulated cleanly but lacks the embodied, messy texture of a person under immense pressure, reading more as a theorem proving itself.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization leans toward an archetype of the hopeful artist rather than a complex individual. Her primary trait, "methodically hopeful," is stated and demonstrated but lacks an on-page moment of internal conflict or doubt to test it. The story successfully embodies her quiet persistence, but she reads more as a vessel for the theme than a person with contradictory impulses acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her desire to rescue her community's culture. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction; she proceeds with a noble certainty rather than a visible internal struggle. The characterization is functional and evocative but feels more like a vessel for the story's theme than a deeply complex individual, particularly when she explicitly voices the story's moral at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    The clock maker's motivation ("to step beyond fate's design") is clear but abstract, serving more as a premise than a deeply felt interior drive. His actions align with his "neatly inventive" trait, but his internal state is often declared ("bleak exhilaration") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. He functions effectively as a competent puzzle-solver but lacks the compelling internal conflict or vulnerability that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is established abstractly but lacks texture; the inciting detail of her brother's resuscitation is disconnected from the subsequent internal conflict. Her final assertion of agency with the word ‘vanish’ feels sudden rather than earned by a visible internal progression. The whispering advisor serves his function as a catalyst but remains a flat archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prophet’s motivation is clear but one-dimensional, presented as a static philosophical principle rather than an embodied need. He is a competent vessel for the story's concept, but lacks internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses. His success feels preordained, which limits character depth and makes his profound belief feel asserted rather than earned through a visible struggle or sacrifice within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks significant internal conflict. While her "quietly driven" nature is demonstrated, her journey feels more like a methodical execution of a plan than a struggle against doubt or contradictory impulses. The shift from "dread" to "resolve" is effective but could have been more deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear, but his defining trait, being "emotionally rational," is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized. The interiority relies on abstract labels and summaries, such as his mind "cataloguing each symbol" or his heart "acknowledging that compassion could coexist with stark fact." This diagnostic self-awareness at the climax flattens the character, making the resolution feel more like an intellectual thesis statement than an earned, embodied change.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s core contradiction, being "stoically sensitive," is effectively dramatized through the contrast between her calm, methodical actions and her intense inner state ("heart hammered like a drum"). Her motivation is clear and personal, driving the entire scene. The characterization is specific and consistent, though it relies on one key direct statement to articulate its central paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "tranquilly perceptive" rather than embodied internal conflict. She remains a competent functionary executing a task without any visible struggle, flaw, or meaningful trade-off. Her resolve is stated but never truly tested, which flattens her arc into a simple success story.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern maker’s motivation is clear, potent, and directly drives the ritual at the story's core. His internal conflict—creating beauty from pain—is consistently embodied in the "luminous torment." While the character is a perfect vessel for the story's concept, his interiority remains focused solely on this process, lacking secondary contradictions or flaws that would give him a deeper, more unpredictable dimension beyond his grief and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is established effectively by the "drone-strike wedding" backstory, providing a powerful initial anchor. However, the interiority quickly shifts from specific grief to abstract, philosophical states ("unfiltered awakening," "potential became palpable"). The final emotional state of "bleak exhilaration" is asserted more than it is earned through a granular, contradictory emotional process on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization is superficial, relying on archetypal roles rather than developed individuals. Lira's defining trait, being "perpetually surprised," is an asserted label that has no bearing on her actions or choices. Her interiority consists of unearned epiphanies and abstract awe, lacking the specific, contradictory impulses of a compelling character under pressure; the pilgrim functions as a thematic mouthpiece, not a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized. Phrases like "each fabricated recollection gnaws at the conscience I try desperately to quiet" tell us about the struggle rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. The final shift toward redemption feels earned conceptually but emotionally abrupt, relying on a highly articulated self-awareness that lessens the impact of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to atone for a past failure is clear and drives the central action. However, the interiority relies on abstract labels ("recycle mistakes into wisdom") and repeated phrases ("furrowed hush") rather than specific, contradictory impulses shown in the moment. The opposing negotiator acts more as a mirror than an independent character, reflecting the protagonist's resolve and softening on cue, which lessens the feeling of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The navigator's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is present, but the interiority is over-articulated. Lines like "each pull of the paddle echoed his intention to align heart and action" function as diagnostic labels rather than embodied emotion, summarizing the character's goal instead of letting it emerge from the struggle. While the emotional progression is credible, its expression lacks the specificity and contradiction expected at the highest level, reading more as a performed arc of healing than a messy, lived one.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character’s motivation is clear but stated too explicitly (“My motivation was simple yet profound...”). The internal conflict between the dirty past and the desire for a clean slate is summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the present scene. The final change feels more like an intellectual epiphany than an embodied, hard-won shift, as seen in the over-articulated conclusion about feeling the world's sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, providing a strong narrative engine. However, her core internal conflict—the "reluctant metamorphosis"—is stated more than it is embodied. The text labels her dread, but her actions proceed with a smoothness that undercuts the claimed reluctance, making the "paradoxically steady" trait feel more like a label than a dramatized contradiction. A moment of visceral hesitation or a choice made against a tangible wave of fear would have solidified this crucial character tension.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation is clear and the character’s internal shift is earned by the story's end. However, her interiority sometimes reads as thematic summary ("Willingly perplexed by the paradox...") rather than an embodied, contradictory feeling, which keeps her at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her core internal conflict—generating joy against a backdrop of cosmic sorrow—is well-realized through the embodied mechanic of becoming lighter. The character feels slightly archetypal, a serene vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual with contradictory impulses acting in the moment. Her final, decisive grin feels more like a necessary plot beat than a deeply earned, difficult emotional breakthrough against the specified "cold pressure."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but abstract ("understand the texture of transformation"), making her choices feel more illustrative than driven by internal conflict. While her interiority is present, it often reads as authorial summary of a theme rather than the embodied, contradictory thoughts of a specific person. The character serves the concept well, but lacks the particularity and flawed decision-making under pressure that would elevate her beyond a thematic vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies more on elegant labels (“calmly inventive precision”) than on dramatized internal conflict. The struggle is an external puzzle, and his interiority, while tonally consistent, lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotional cost. He functions effectively as a catalyst for the plot but reads as a somewhat detached, archetypal figure designed to serve the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selene's motivation to impose order on a future she fears is clear and compelling. The transformation of her curse from a prison to a compass provides a strong internal arc. However, the epiphany feels slightly too neat; the interiority occasionally relies on direct statements of fear or resolve rather than fully embodying the contradictory struggle in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies heavily on conceptual labels ("furiously tranquil") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The interiority is abstract, articulating the story's theme more than revealing a specific, flawed individual under pressure. His final realization feels more like an authorial thesis statement than an earned, character-bound epiphany, lacking the grit of a genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The characters function as elegant archetypes—the "dueling philosopher," the "diplomat of ideas"—but lack specific, embodied interiority. Their motivations are explicitly stated rather than revealed through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The diplomat's "fierce resolve" is asserted but her on-page actions are limited to parrying and gracefully conceding, leaving her character feeling underdeveloped compared to the philosopher.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s primary character trait—molting personalities—is asserted rather than dramatized. We are told she emerges with "fresh insight" but never see a specific persona constrain a choice or create internal conflict on the page. Her motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal, serving the story's poetic concept more than embodying a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character's motivation is clear but operates as a single, sustained drive ("steely longing") rather than a complex interiority with contradictory impulses. He functions more as a determined archetype—The Artist defying Fate—than a psychologically specific individual. While his actions are consistent, the characterization lacks the granular, embodied emotion and internal conflict required for the highest tier, reading as a vessel for the story's potent mood.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her core internal conflict, "luminous doubt," is effectively named and transformed into the "engine of her resolve." However, her characterization leans more toward being an elegant vessel for the story's concepts rather than a deeply complex individual with fully embodied emotions. The link between thought and action is strong, but the internal contradictions are more stated than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)
    The tutor's motivation is clear but lacks depth; he functions more as a symbolic vessel for the theme than a character with compelling internal contradictions. His interiority is expressed through abstract, poetic concepts ("the color of unspoken apologies") rather than embodied emotion or conflicting impulses acting in the scene. While his actions are consistent, he reads as a static figure whose sole purpose is to perform the story's central ritual without significant personal struggle or change beyond the final, somewhat declared, epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to test her hypothesis on butterfly dust is clear and rooted in her scientific background, intensifying through observations that compel a shift to humility; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in her soft laugh of relief, revealing contradictory impulses between grand theories and quiet decay. The change to earned stasis feels credible, foreclosing dramatic pursuits with a felt cost of stripped ambition. Relationships and status dynamics are absent as it's single-POV with no other on-page characters.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elya's motivation to rebuild after the fire is clear and rooted in her adaptive traits, shown through micro-choices like following the ledger's paths, but interiority leans toward abstract epiphanies rather than embodied contradictions, as in the final realization of purpose without simultaneous conflicting impulses. The endurance of her art forecloses paths with felt cost from the scorched workshop, yet emotions feel performed rather than contradictory in peak moments. Relationships are absent, fitting single-POV scope, and flaws like stubborn spark drive mistakes that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation as a capsize survivor is clear and intensifies through embodied memories of the sea, compelling her to activate the device; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses of fear and longing shown in her pulse and scars. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and her endurance forecloses silence with felt cost in the final realization. The single-POV focus excels in revealing values through micro-choices like pressing the fork, though secondary characters are absent, fitting scope.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marlow's motivation as a stubborn undertaker guiding souls is clear and rooted in traits, intensifying through his resolve to reassemble the lens despite water pressure, but interiority relies on abstract metaphors like "carrier of silence" rather than embodied contradictions; emotions feel performed via poetic labels without simultaneous impulses in scene, though his final respite shows a credible endurance with felt cost in the weight lifting from his shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation to sustain the community is clear and rooted in persistent traits, shown through her dawn declarations and bell-ringing, but interiority relies on abstract summaries like "gentle pressure of responsibility" rather than embodied contradictions under stress. No on-page second character limits relationship crucibles, though her flaws subtly complicate choices without full dramatic irony. The endurance in the final dawn feels earned with a felt cost of isolation, aligning with single-POV baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo's motivation to free unused love is clear and intensifies through breath-aligned choices, rooted in spiritual curiosity that compels the climax; interiority is concrete via embodied breathing and memory flashes, showing contradictory impulses like wonder and ache without stock labels. However, emotions occasionally lean toward abstract summary, as in "he felt the pilgrimage complete," slightly diluting embodiment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to dissolve perception boundaries is clear but remains abstract, rooted in poetic traits rather than embodied contradictions; interiority uses stock epiphanic phrasing like "felt the texture of time under her fingertips" without simultaneous impulses in scene. The child's brief appearance adds no relational pressure, and Mara's flaws feel ornamental, not complicating choices with visible cost. Earned stasis at the end lacks a foreclosed path with dramatized trade-off, trending functional but limited.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation to retrieve the seeds for planting resilience is clear and rooted in her chained liberator role, intensifying through patient actions like decoding the piano bench puzzle, but interiority relies on abstract poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of chains feels earned symbolically yet lacks a visible on-page cost tied to specific flaws complicating choices. Strengths include consistent traits shown in micro-choices under pressure, such as listening to notes recalling her mother's lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation to imprint memories by collecting absences is clear and rooted in her trait of hearing colors, intensifying through her actions in the greenhouse; however, interiority relies on abstract poetic descriptions rather than embodied contradictions under pressure, with emotions like grief feeling summarized instead of layered with irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her “kindled humility” is shown through tactile micro-choices (brushing dust, aligning vial with light). The shift from cosmic ambition to garden-scale patience is credible, but the final renunciation is more stated than dramatized; the cost is felt but not sharply foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elya’s embodied tremor and tactile memory of heat ground her interiority; the ledger strip becomes a concrete pivot that re-weights her purpose. Yet the shift from “must retrace” to “understood then” is compressed into summary, muting the cost of adaptation. Her final act of tucking the strip into the kiln base offers a quiet Earned Stasis, but the emotional price feels generalized rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s embodied memory of the sea and her tactile handling of the fork/case give credible interiority; the final choice to “carry the song” is earned by prior heat-mapping trials. Yet the shift from private grief to public pilgrimage is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the cost of exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlow’s stubborn resolve is embodied in his micro-choices—wading into flooded aisles, reassembling the lens, floating the last shard—each action carrying visible cost (soaked lungs, rusted hands, impossible perch). Interiority stays concrete: “each breath a reminder that he, too, was a carrier of silence.” The final renunciation—vanishing into the glow—earns its inevitability through prior causality. Flaw: no contradictory impulse in scene; stubbornness is monovalent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her “gentle pressure of responsibility” is felt—but the story leans on summary rather than scene to dramatize contradictory impulses; the final renunciation (ringing the bell again) is earned yet the cost is more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo’s spiritual curiosity is embodied in breath-synced micro-choices; the interior contradiction between wonder and ache is palpable. The final renunciation—setting the camera aside—earns its cost through prior causal linkage to the tear and the lattice. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Flaw: the “pilgrim of sparks” label is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s retrocognitive entrapment is embodied in her tactile design choices; the final “brushstroke on an ever-changing canvas” crystallizes her renunciation of static control. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, though the child’s brief presence lacks reciprocal pressure. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara's interiority is specific—chains as bodily pressure, a lullaby recalled only where it unlocks the piano puzzle, her contradictory impulses (caution vs. desperate urgency) manifest in micro-choice and embodied tension. The final renunciation—"chains now rusted loose"—is foreshadowed by every clink, each step earned through the seed-guardian ethos laid groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s synesthetic hearing and designer identity are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between collecting absences and seeking reparation is dramatized in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the device among the roots—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor slip: “cells divide” reflection drifts toward summary rather than immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “liquid dusk” movement and heartbeat-rose moment embody motive—but the shift from thief to guardian feels summarized rather than dramatized; the cost of renouncing theft is stated, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “weighty lightness” motive is dramatized through micro-choices (narrating valves, coaxing silica).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—stunt bravado vs. terror—is embodied in trembling hands and rehearsed calm; the final choice to confess fear and drink the amber is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost (loss of the old mask).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)

Still, the single POV holds cleanly and the arc of janitor-as-creator is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine dresser’s interiority is embodied and consistent—his “wisely pragmatic” trait shows in the tactile ritual of polishing cracked marbles. Internal contradiction surfaces in the “blooming withering” paradox, but the final choice (kneeling, placing the marble) feels slightly under-motivated; the garden’s voice resolves tension more than his own micro-choice. Still, the cost of humility is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her mechanically warm hands, measured heartbeat, and quiet smile anchor her—but the “prove time moves sideways” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse tests it under pressure. The final choice (pulling the lever) is causally earned yet the cost is diffuse—an “icy warmth” rather than a forfeiture she visibly feels. Still, her obliging nature threads through micro-choices (calibrating turbines, whispering to birds), keeping her individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for silence vs. need to break it—are embodied in trembling finger, swollen violin, and final bow stroke. Motive intensifies from curiosity to sacred duty, culminating in earned renunciation when she returns the dried program. Cost is felt in the hush that settles “like gentle water.”

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mirela’s interior contradiction—seeking certainty while smudging data—drives every beat; the swallowed-lie memory and final resolve carry visible cost. Fever-break clarity and “auroral sorrow” are embodied, not labeled. Micro-choice to adjust the barometer by a fraction crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The arc earns its quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s skeptical stance and explorer identity are embodied in micro-choices (weighing reverberations, leaving the wheel), but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“drowsy alertness” repeated). The renunciation is earned and carries cost, yet the religious skepticism never collides with the ghost-shift material in a way that forces a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s choice to step into the refuge is legible but motivation remains abstract—“regenerative silence” is asserted, not embodied; no embodied contradiction disturbs his placid drift, so renunciation lacks earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is gentle and consistent, but her choices remain observational; the decisive act—playing the harp—does not evolve under pressure. The baby-curl keepsake is handled twice, yet its emotional charge is asserted rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene; her stance is static. Closure is a communal mood shift, not a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured—ash on coat, trembling page—but the historian’s choices remain observational; no contradictory impulse forces a costly decision. The final “gently shifted” axis is accepted rather than contested, so the closure lacks visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interior voice is vivid and obsessive, but motivation (“encoding life into a new key”) is declared rather than dramatized; final epiphany feels pre-wrapped rather than earned on-page. Tasty but one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-character focus delivers nuanced metaphysical interiority, yet priest’s decisions arise more from abstract cosmology than grounded traits: motives float in ornate diction rather than embodied struggle, blurring cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her longing is felt in the nautilus shell’s glow and the sand-between-toes memory. The contradiction between homesickness and the drive to conduct unseen symphonies is dramatized in her micro-choices (aligning shell with horizon, sketching on frost). The final renunciation of homesickness as burden, accepting it as compass, is earned and carries visible cost in the glowing lake. Minor slip: “chronologically homesick” leans label-speak, though context rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is vivid—"the world sigh beneath his weightless boots"—but the self-confrontation remains abstract; no embodied contradiction is dramatized. The final acceptance of "every version of himself" is asserted rather than earned through visible micro-choices. Motivation is thematically clear yet causally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marin’s interiority is embodied and specific—her palm on stone, the “frost of her inner apathy”—but the arc from numbness to thaw is slightly front-loaded; the final smile feels earned yet the cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s lyrical interiority is sensor-rich yet the motivational thread occasionally slackens; her acts align with motive but don’t deepen flaw or tension in ways that ratchet cost, so the internal struggle reads distant rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. emotional surrender—are embodied in his ritual of sniff-checking lamp oil before every bloom; the final choice to catalog tears is earned by the prior sensory onslaught and carries visible cost (the copper seal, the promise to return). Interiority is specific, never clinical; “aromatically cautious” is shown through micro-choices, not labels. The only slip is a brief drift toward abstract grief summation near the end, but it does not unmotivate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s desire to “discover the texture of time” is stated early and threads through every beat; the final binding of the rope to the stone is a credible renunciation that costs him the chance to release the escaped soul’s memory. Interiority is lyric rather than embodied, and the ethical playfulness is asserted more than dramatized, but the micro-choice at the fork is specific and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Violinist’s interiority is vivid—she “feels vibrations through the damp earth”—but her decisive act (bow lifted to unbind silence) is more ritual gesture than costly choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the Earned Stasis feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—trading half-truths for money—is clear and consistent; interiority is tactile (“weight of half truths settle like dust on her palm”) yet emotion stays mercenary. Her final micro-choice (slipping the now-ready vial away) crystallizes the arc and keeps her at affectionate remove, leaving closure intact. Flaw is that her interior conflicts are almost entirely stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority shows both profit-driven instinct and authentic mercy in early beats; her silent ledger vow under the skylight crystallizes her arc. She endures no visible physical cost, but her final Charged Poise on the lighthouse balcony visibly costs her the safety of emotional detachment. Internal contradictions (“cautious exuberance”) animate her choices rather than summary labels. One minor slip: status dialogue with the keeper remains generic, diluting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arlen’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “boldly sympathetic” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a choice that costs her. The final vow to dedicate the arbor is voiced, not dramatized, so the felt cost is muted. Secondary villagers remain off-page, so no relationship crucible is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s desire to “find the place where echoes are born” is clear and embodied through her sketching and pendant use, but interior contradiction is muted; the final renunciation of the pendant feels more symbolic than personally costly, so the earned change lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conjurer’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives are stated (“to understand the mathematics of emotion”) rather than embodied in moment-to-moment choices. No contradictory impulses appear on the page, and the final insight feels gifted rather than earned through visible struggle. The glass-eye handling is evocative yet never forces a decision that costs him anything concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—slipping through vents, brushing the coil against copper, fitting it to the spindle—each action revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak; the moment she feels the memory “surge through her” is earned by prior causality. The final step into visibility carries visible cost: she forfeits her phantom anonymity to become a living conduit for grief. Flaw is minimal but present—her compulsive caching risks exposure—yet it complicates rather than undercuts the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlowe’s interiority is vivid—his “circuitously sincere” smile and “sharp scientific curiosity” anchor him—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final renunciation (stepping back) is earned yet stated more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s insomnia and grief-rooted drive are embodied in concrete micro-choices (slipping boots, lifting the brooch) and culminate in the felt cost of surrendering her canvases; the interior contradiction between preserving art and seeking renewal is dramatized rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical but generic; the “clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming” is asserted, not dramatized through contradiction or error. Her single decisive act—accepting the cave’s inhabitation—lacks prior causal pressure and visible cost, so the change feels gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Archivist’s interiority is evocative yet abstract; motives (“compile fragments into meaning”) are stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices. No contradictory impulses surface in-scene; the exile backstory is ornamental. The final communal act is earned but the cost feels diffuse, not personally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremor of certainty in her fingertips”), but the mapper’s contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final vow feels more declared than earned. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the punch) align with motive, yet no visible flaw complicates the ascent to stewardship. Cost is gestured at (“never cease the unraveling”) rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—logic vs wonder—is embodied in micro-choices (tea to the wind, precise notes) and culminates in the costly renunciation of pure skepticism when she whispers the promise. The trait “courageously kind” is dramatized through the act of offering sanctuary, but the emotional layering feels slightly smoothed rather than jagged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The immortal’s ennui is palpable and embodied (“eyes heavy”), but interiority drifts toward abstraction (“centuries of ennui”). His choice to follow the amulet is dramatized, yet the contradiction between boredom and curiosity is asserted rather than enacted in real time. The final renunciation of emptiness feels earned because the magnetic pivot reconfigures his stance, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interior contradictions (con-artist’s honest offspring) vividly propel the ink contract beat; her ‘fair-trade mathematics’ offer deliberate moral anchoring under pressure. Embodied waiting balances resolve and doubt; the renunciation of con-man legacy is earned on parchment and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stationer’s motivation to “collect textures of different times” is stated early and remains consistent, but his interiority stays abstract—no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion appear on the page. His single observable choice is to close the notepad and walk on; the cost is hinted at but not dramatized. The absence of a second character or status pressure keeps the crucible narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the “nameless identity” is a lived void that drives the choice to become “living archive.” The contradiction between erasure and custodianship is dramatized when the label’s glow forces the micro-choice to pocket it and keep gathering. Cost is felt: the act of collecting ghosts cements perpetual exile. Flaw—no secondary character on page—limits relational crucible but does not harm single-POV design.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene’s curiosity and grief are embodied through tactile micro-choices—placing the shell, lifting the ledger—yet the interior contradiction between myth-busting and wonder is stated more than dramatized in scene. The final smile and pocketing of the shell register as earned endurance, but the cost feels generalized rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “tightrope” of dual loyalty is embodied in the moment she chooses the phoenix mural—but the old dock workers remain off-page abstractions, muting the relational crucible and the full cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“a tremor of grief”); the inspector’s curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (calibrating the chemical timer, whispering to the summit). The final renunciation—accepting loss while sealing the grain—earns its cost. Yet the trait “purposefully curious” is asserted more than tested under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “tracing the edge of the now-perfect wing” shows tactile memory guiding choice. Blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that shapes every micro-decision; the water-refraction method is credible and costly. The final renunciation—turning back to the bench—earns its quiet cost because the prior beats have shown what she forfeits by staying. Only the colleague’s entrance feels ornamental, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied (trembling fingertip, smile softening sarcasm) and her motive—map the rivers’ birth—drives every beat. The phrasebook’s dog-ear and condensation pattern act as externalized thought, forcing micro-choices that reveal her under pressure. A credible renunciation/acceptance of risk is present when she steps outside to record the first coordinates, sealing her path. Minor: “subtly confident” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tuner’s patience and vow to restore balance are stated rather than embodied; no interior contradiction surfaces in the single scene. His only micro-choice—placing the fork—starts the magic but is not revisited under pressure. The final renunciation (walking away) is legible yet feels pre-ordained, not earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—panic coils, memories surface—but the “harness the ephemeral” motive arrives as a late, abstract epiphany rather than a trait-driven escalation. The final renunciation (letting the beacon fade) is emotionally legible yet feels externally prompted by temple decree rather than by an earned contradiction inside her. Still, embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure keep her above mid-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The boy’s interiority is vivid—his mother’s lattice pulses against his palm, guiding each step—but the “cry wolf” backstory is asserted more than dramatized, muting the contradiction between false alarms and earned trust. His final choice to map the reef for others is credible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally searing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Only one on-page character; she acts consistently with her debt-driven drive yet her interiority hovers in lyrical reprise rather than concrete pressure-cooker moments. Motive is clear—'a debt forged in past life'—but micro-choices under increasing stakes happen offstage or are distilled into image ('she released a sigh'). Renunciation qualifies as earned stasis when she dissolves into blossoms; cost is implied, but character granularity blurs under layered lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the weaver’s “hauntingly optimistic” trait is asserted rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final beat feels pre-ordained. Still, her single-minded purpose and ritualized action create a coherent arc with visible cost—she defies guild law and exhausts herself nightly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“warmly curious heart swelling”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final smile feels earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal. No genuine flaw complicates her path, so the arc leans restorative rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the clipboard and chalk, the embodied awe when the glyphs pulse—but the “meaning in the margins” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to complicate her resolve. The final smile registers as earned stasis yet the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt the ember’s heat travel through the silk like a secret signal”), but the final choice—slipping the chart into a courier’s satchel—feels slightly under-motivated; we see no moment of doubt or cost that would make the renunciation sting. The contradiction between wisdom and foolishness is asserted rather than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The medium’s interiority is rich—her “fierce tenderness” is embodied in the way she grips the shard and breathes the letters onto glass. Motivation remains consistent: every beat is filtered through the need to let the unsent words speak before deciding. The final renunciation (leaving the letters as fireflies) is earned by the prior ritual and costs her the weight she carried. Only a slight excess of lyrical summary keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Translator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“shrewdly innocent gleam,” “lotus-hearted ache”), but the child remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses surface in the translator under pressure, and the final “graft” is asserted rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motive — “to rediscover lost joy and share it” — is stated early and stays consistent; interiority is abstract rather than embodied, emotions labeled rather than enacted. A visible cost is present: fragment dissolves into starlight—an earned renunciation—but prior causality is more lyrical assertion than micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—her “nested awakening” and brush-tap choices embody the shift from certainty to curiosity—but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral; the final smile is earned yet lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander’s defiance is vivid and embodied in seed-planting, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final alliance with Dr. Mirabel arrives without visible cost to his guarded spark.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush but abstract; the poet’s “shyly unstoppable” trait never collides with a concrete choice that costs him something. The centuries-long frame keeps pain at a safe distance, so the coral-gathering heart reads more as lyrical motif than embodied flaw driving a final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority blooms in concrete micro-choices—aligning the chime, sealing the vial—yet emotion flirts with lyric cliché (“foxglove regret,” “violet sorrow”). Motivation to resurrect names is coherent; the final gift of a glass orchid crystallizes purpose. Secondary pressure is absent; traveler merely receives. Cost registers softly in returned foxglove regret, but agency stays interior and serene rather than pressured to a crucible point.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “carefully reckless” stance is embodied in micro-choices like dipping the ink well and whispering promises to glyphs. Contradictory impulses (exhilaration vs duty) coexist in scene. The final pledge carries visible cost: she accepts perpetual responsibility for the archive’s voice. Yet the keepers remain shadows; no status shift is dramatized on-page, muting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. progress) act simultaneously in scene. The encrypted-compassion cipher is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—brushing glue, aligning chain links—rather than stated. The final clasp with the elder crystallizes a status shift with visible cost (shared chain). Only the council remains off-page, so relationship crucible is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“balanced the weight of her past”), but the arc leans on summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost yet lacks a decisive on-page micro-choice that rewrites her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the child’s “featherly determined” trait is named more than embodied. Micro-choices (hand on copper, foot on seam) are present yet feel guided by authorial design rather than urgent contradiction. The final renunciation—turning back to share the secret—lands as quiet Earned Stasis, but the cost is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s interiority is lyrical but thin; her contradictory impulses (“to captivate spirits” vs. “asking for guidance”) are stated rather than dramatized. The final “feeling of belonging” is earned by ritual, not by a visible cost or choice that forecloses another path. Micro-choices (placing the feather, playing instruments) are present but feel pre-ordained, not pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid—her bittersweet smile at the teal chord, the amber pulse of her longing—but the “cheerful gloom” refrain edges toward label-speak. Micro-choices (pressing seed to glass, placing final seed) are clear and motive-driven, yet the emotional cost feels generalized rather than embodied in a specific loss or flaw. The ending’s Earned Stasis (accepting perpetual wandering) is credible, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—“chaos could be a melody”—but the performer’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no embodied cost is dramatized when he renounces the inked plan. The final bow feels earned yet the bishop’s re-pocketing lacks visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her exile is embodied in the “tinged pale light” after each fold-through—yet the cosmic-verse ambition remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—watching mist fracture into arguing colors refracts her own conflict—but decisions remain observational rather than choice-forcing until the subtle dawn renunciation, keeping the arc just shy of explosion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid: her scarred skin, the “hard softness,” the embodied memory of lost hikers. Yet some beats abstract emotion (“a promise she had traded for three lives”) before concrete micro-choices occur. The bargain is reconfigured through the final gift, showing cost via the village children’s smiles, but the hikers’ personal guilt could be tightened in one extra micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arin’s interiority is vivid—his “lucidly watchful” stance threads through micro-choices like mapping balloon altitudes—but the emotional contradiction is muted; no moment shows him torn between hope and doubt. The final renunciation (gauge as mirror) is earned, yet the cost feels communal rather than personal, softening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning to map dreams yet fearing the burden—surface in micro-choices like pressing the film to stone. The lineage pressure is palpable, but the “shared responsibility” epiphany feels slightly over-articulated rather than dramatized. Still, her final acceptance carries visible cost: the ash-warm weight against her spine.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s childhood motive is stated rather than dramatized, but his calm under pressure and embodied brushwork create credible interiority; the final smile registers cost yet feels slightly under-earned because the mirrors’ awakening is more miracle than consequence of a visible flaw or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tear, the ache in her shoulders—but the “operatively gentle” paradox is asserted more than dramatized; we see its effect on others, not the internal friction it costs her. The final bow of the chieftains is moving, yet her own decisive micro-choice (lifting the clipboard) feels foregone rather than wrestled. Still, her embodied emotion and the visible price anchor the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—profit-driven cruelty vs secret tenderness—as embodied in the act of cradling the egg. Each choice aligns with his amoral code, yet the tear redeems nothing. Backstory/fragment reflection anchors only in present action (cracking the egg), so stays well under limit. Single micro-choice at release reweights his world, earning the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “bodily poetic rhythm” and “quiet hymn” remain metaphorical labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation—vanishing after the city awakens—earns a resonant stasis yet lacks a prior micro-choice that visibly costs her. Motivation to defy conformity is declared early but never tested in a specific dilemma. Character reads as archetype more than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene’s interiority is vivid—her “meteor hush” and reversed radar dishes mirror her ethical struggle—but the final reversal of narrative power is asserted more than dramatized; we see the insight, not the cost enacted. The serenity trait is embodied in calm micro-choices yet never truly tested under pressure, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; motives (honor histories) remain thematic rather than embodied crisis. No contradictory impulse presses her under higher stakes—she drifts rather than compromises. Actions (knots) signal intent yet lack granular physical tension. Choice to stay is Earned Stasis, yet cost stays atmospheric, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot chill and “technically gentle” touch reveal vocation and temperament—but the forgiveness arc is asserted rather than dramatized; the shift from doubt to resolve is too smooth, lacking visible contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“eyes glinting with the paradox of seeing both what has been and what will be”—but the final transcendence feels slightly abstract rather than earned by prior micro-choices; the wafer seal’s ascent is more spectacle than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Nabu’s interiority is vividly hoard-smart and math-precise, and every grain-count or star-chart directly pushes his final covenant sketch; the irony of rationing grain while decoding infinity is embodied and shapes micro-moves at outset and altar.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “gentle twist of hidden gears” credo is embodied in the stealth placement of the box—but the monks remain collective silhouettes; Kovan’s jaw unfurling is the only embodied micro-choice we witness. The cellular-memory premise is asserted rather than dramatized inside any monk’s skin, so the change feels administered rather than earned at cellular scale.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s interior motive is present and embodied, but the pivotal “synchronized breathing” remains described more than dramatized; still, micro-choices in stance shift are legible on the page and the renunciation-to-keep has felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her feisty spark and generational guilt collide in the orchard—but Mira remains a prop; the mother-daughter crucible never pressures a choice. The final “thank you” to the orchard is earned, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“simply complicated” mind, luminous pollen on skin), but the curator’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure until the final press of the cameo. The surrender of linear narrative is declared rather than dramatized in scene. Cost is felt but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Selene’s motive to “rescue unlearned knowledge” is stated early and her linguistic skill drives every beat; yet interiority stays abstract—no bodily fear, fatigue, or contradiction under pressure. The final choice to step through the portal is earned by prior causal chain, but the cost (leaving the mountain’s safety) is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush but abstract; the chimera’s contradictory impulses (“blissfully aberrant” vs. “half-remembered maps”) are stated rather than dramatized in micro-choice. The final gathering of blossoms earns a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara is sharply realized through cataloguing ticks and methodical micro-choices—hands re-weaving the rope, fingertips feeling the seal’s hum—but her interior remains largely aligned with a single, calm curiosity; a single, slight contradiction or slip in emotional layering (a tremor of fear before the door? doubt that costs her?) would have tipped this into the 9+ band. The cost is present—silence replaces the tower’s tick—but it sits more as closure image than embodied character price.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority vivid—silver pulses, skin ripple-marked—yet motive “find the quiet in the storm” stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized between his need for calm and any fear or cost of using the stone. Emotions remain embodied, but the choice to conjure feels inevitable, not fraught. The final smile and whispered promise register as earned stasis with cost only implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstract self-explanation (“I must prove…”) rather than embodied contradiction; the custodian’s stubborn hope is consistent and the final vow carries visible cost, yet the shard’s agency sometimes overrides the custodian’s micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“preemptively nostalgic heart sang”), but the archivist’s choices remain observational—no irreversible micro-choice with visible cost. Motivation is clear yet static; identity-sculpting never collides with a live trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Designer’s interiority is vivid—contradictory impulses of playfulness and resolve embodied in the rag-knot ritual—but the final vow feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The chronicler’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized. Her “discovery” is reported rather than enacted, so the cost feels diffuse. The final smile is earned but the emotional arc is more observed than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobic fear vs. hunger for sky—are embodied in the “stretching contracted” chest and the porcelain doll’s pulse. Micro-choice to limit exposure to one breath per silence shows value hierarchy under pressure. Earned renunciation: he returns underground with a widened heart, cost paid in the lingering scent of lost filaments. Only the mother’s smile feels slightly external; interiority stays strictly Lio’s.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her motive to “teach silence” is stated repeatedly yet never tested by a concrete choice or contradiction. The only micro-choice—whispering counter-tones—remains gestural, so the Earned Stasis feels asserted rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse or visible cost surfaces on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mina’s contradictory kernels—archive duty versus ascent ambition—embed in immediate tactile choices: the flake chosen over the codex, the throne chosen over lingering. The final kneel and extra flake placement mark Earned Stasis where her flaw of restless eras '-and-onward dreams exact the cost of perpetual stewardship. Embodied emotion peaks in the “circuitry across the horizon” without therapy-speak, though interiority once calls her “wisely adventurous” aloud, a minor border slip.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Contradictory impulses—yearning to isolate vs. need to connect—pulse through every beat; the keeper’s final choice to step into starlight costs everything (isolation, the ring, scars), paid on the page as “leaving the doorknocker ring…relic for any soul”. Character voice remains singular, not stock; only slight distancing comes from occasional lyrical summarization of emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressure of truth would always spawn brilliance”), but the survivor’s wariness is more asserted than dramatized; the final choice to trust the quantum promise is credible yet slightly under-costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lian’s interiority is textured through sensory embodiment (“heart beat in cadence,” breath merging with shadows) and a consistent arc from passive curiosity to active listener. Motives—honor lineage yet renounce tyranny—remain legible and escalate to the final extraction of scroll; cost sits in the confession he now must carry. Micro-choice to lift oak slab under rhythm guidance feels earned against prior pressure. Minor slip: “dynasty ender” badge is asserted more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The knight’s solitude and “murmured allegiance” are consistently dramatized through bodily micro-choices (hand on glyphs, armor melting into moss). The interior contradiction—yearning for possibility vs. fear of exposure—remains embodied. A clear renunciation occurs when the armor fuses away, but some inner beats still skew toward “philosophical summary” rather than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Amelia’s interiority is textured and embodied (“trembling fingertips,” “quiet thrill”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the shift from broken-hearted to “steadier” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost. The button acts as an external catalyst, yet her final micro-choice—placing it on the blank file—reads more ritual than irreversible stance. Still, the specificity of her perceptual lens and the occupation-driven stakes keep her above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s quiet resolve and resourcefulness are embodied in tactile micro-choices (salvaged lenses, shadow maps), but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized in-scene; the final endurance carries cost yet feels slightly predetermined rather than wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the saxophonist’s contradictory impulses (to play yet erase) are implied rather than embodied in micro-choice. The final renunciation is legible—he seals the case and walks away—but the cost is more atmospheric than visceral. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation to decode leaves is clear and embodied in her seed-row rituals, but the interior contradiction—orderly mind vs. mystical surrender—remains asserted rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The final “mossy delight” transformation is vivid yet feels bestowed rather than earned through a visible cost or mistake. Micro-choices (prod, erect tower) align with motive but do not force a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s contrarian relationship with time (always repairing clocks that will never keep it) powers every beat, culminating in her willingness to trust the compass’s paradox and surrender her need to “fix” uncertainty. The cost is felt: she pockets the ember and the new waterfall-fed clock proves she has abandoned her old trade, not merely adapted it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the alchemist’s contradictory impulses (precision vs. mystical surrender) play out in the moment of naming the dragon. The final choice—accepting the luminous seam as both repair and burden—earns its cost through prior micro-choices with the coin and furnace. Minor slip: “luminous regret” skirts label-speak, but the embodied pulse of the gold line rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her palm cradling the tooth, the ache softening—but the “modestly fearless” label is asserted rather than tested; the final renunciation (leaving the glowing tooth) is earned yet feels lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s arc is embodied and specific—her trauma responses do alter tactics (the path-finding through pain is dramatized). The shift from survival tool to redemptive beacon for the pewter strap lands with felt cost and micro-choice on page. Interior contradiction—desire to end darkness while re-entering it through memory—is held in simultaneous tension. Small drift: the moment the ‘mathematics of mercy’ is spoken aloud leans summary, blurring the strict dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lighthouse lens pulses through the entire arc; interior contradiction crystallizes in "I realize that my translation has become that beacon." Cost is visible—dissolving the fragment into communal memory. No secondary characters on page to test relationships; single-POV motives stay consistent. Interiority is vivid, but emotion sometimes drifts toward abstract proclamation, muting full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. spectral empathy—surface in embodied micro-choices (setting the barrel, whispering to ghosts). The ledger retrieval crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she trades her “weightless burden” for purposeful guardianship. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. One slip: “skillfully observant” is asserted more than dramatized in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s desire to compress eternity emerges clearly, but internal contradiction and micro-choice are reported, not scenically embodied in moment-to-moment bodily tension. Frost-spiral press slam is the single embodied beat; earlier decisions are narrated rather than dramatized. No credible cost is enacted—only described after the fact—so closure feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “burnished sorrow” and pocketed shard crystallize regret and hope—but the shift from observer to catalyst is slightly under-motivated; the elders’ softening feels externally granted rather than earned by her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alder’s interiority is vivid—his “heart humming with tinkersong wonder” embodies motive—but the covenant’s lie-sensitivity is asserted rather than tested through his choices, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s eccentricity is embodied in tactile choices—pressing compass to palm, cataloguing rain ghosts—yet her interiority stays concrete. The final surrender to “quiet surrender” is earned by prior psychometric readings and the cost of dissolved explanations. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—salt-pine scent, scar-chapters—but her “perpetually learning” trait is asserted rather than tested; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final tableau choice is motivated, yet the cost feels abstract. Secondary characters are absent, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, strong embodiment with minor motivation gap.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted; the final “quiet smile” is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral. The postcards function as memory triggers, yet their weight on her immediate choices is muted until the cathedral beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s solemnity is shown through tactile detail (clutching the notebook), but interiority drifts toward generic “burning reverie.” The micro-choice to trade beach-debris messages is vivid and stakes-driven, yet the diary’s retrocognitive trap is accepted without visible struggle or contradiction. Closure earns a modest renunciation—broadcasting truth at personal risk—but the cost is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of the bottle’s “soothing lies” is embodied in the pulse of recollection he uses to open it. Motivation (revive via memory) is consistent, but the arc is more emblematic than conflicted; no contradictory impulse complicates the final choice. Micro-choices (questioning the bottle, letting the sigh settle) reveal values, yet the cost feels diffuse—an earned stasis rather than a wound.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Harel’s arc stays interior; while he senses a “velvet disquiet,” no contradictory tug-of-war is dramatized on the page. The final choice—“recording ... a promise of memory preserved”—follows smoothly from prior lines but feels more acceptance than paid-cost renunciation. Traits (dead-language savant) never create a real risk; their utility is all gain, no liability displayed up to payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“storm of calm that churned inside her chest”), and her micro-choice to surrender the acorn cap carries visible cost. The contradiction between furious and tranquil is dramatized in the moment she kneels and asks the mist to teach her, not merely labeled. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV arc is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt his purpose confirmed”), but the tester’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs stewardship) are stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation of the old rope is earned and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but stays embodied; the janitor’s vow and tremor-response give a credible, costly shift. Motivation (empathic custodianship) is consistent and intensifies to the final promise. No contradictory impulses on stage—more reverent monolith than conflicted psyche—so 9+ gate not quite met.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“eyes held the calm of a stone lake”), yet motivation crystallizes late—only when he lifts the box does the cost of silence become visceral. The recluse’s choice to endure muteness is credible, but the shift from passive observer to active guardian feels slightly under-motivated until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s desire to “feel the texture of time passing” is embodied in her tactile handling of relics and the urn fragment; the final map of memory-threads gives her the payoff at visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the borrowed-time premise is asserted more than dramatized until the last beat. Micro-choices (placing the fragment, brushing dust, narrating to villagers) align with motive and foreclose solitude. Still, no contradictory impulses are staged in scene—she moves with steady certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “warmly attentive heart” is stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; choices feel pre-ordained by theme. The final renunciation—“tending the incomplete is not mending but honoring”—is conceptually resonant yet lacks a felt, on-page cost. Characterization stays consistent but never surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s calm acceptance of doom and her scientific ritual are embodied in copper coils and diary entries; she acts, decides, risks. Brazen calm feels credible, but moments like “will of the council lifted” lean declarative instead of costing her something visible. Interiority is specific—glyph murmurs root-to-rock—but the personal stake of her own mortality flickers while interspecies advocacy stays centre.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arin’s “luminous skeptic” trait is embodied in his defiant tracing of footprints and refusal to worship the signal; the contradictory impulse to both question and participate is dramatized when he offers the amber to the tower. Interiority is specific, but the final shift to “home is a pattern of returning” feels slightly abstract rather than earned by prior embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Coachman’s interiority is vivid—his listening posture, the tongue shaping dead glyphs—but the final beat (“ancestors lift”) is summary rather than embodied cost. Motive is legible yet the renunciation of further pods is only implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rook’s interiority is vivid—his nose “retained an intuitively descriptive keenness,” his heart “thumped” at the leaf’s promise—but the shift from passive observer to active guardian is more asserted than dramatized; the final promise is voiced to the wind rather than tested in a choice that costs him something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“compass rose…needles forever pointing toward a true north that no longer existed”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted; the final resolve is felt yet leans on summary rather than a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander’s contradictory impulses—thief’s daring vs. apprentice’s reverence—surface in the tactile chess-swap ritual, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“soul expand like a sunrise”) rather than embodied contradiction under final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s shift from rehearsed survivor to active historian is embodied in her deliberate footfalls and the scroll’s weight on her shoulders; the contradiction between feigned and felt terror is shown, not told. Her micro-choice to “heal” after “remember what fell” crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is specific, though the benevolent ruthlessness is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her childhood courtyard shattering under memory’s weight is embodied and specific—but the buried-talent thread is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat, blunting the cost of her choice to seed new stories.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—"fierce repose" and embodied fidgeting anchor the tutor’s contradiction—but the forgiveness arc leans on summary near the end rather than a final embodied cost, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s defiance and mischief are vivid, but her interior contradiction—between the price she owes and her playful method—never crystallizes into a single, embodied choice. The “piece of herself” she offers remains metaphorical; no tangible loss is dramatized. Lio is present but exerts no pressure; thus relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final beat is a soft collective catharsis rather than a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s contradictory impulses (doubt vs resolve) are dramatized through tactile micro-choices with the charm and statue. The final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the acid-sea ceasefire. Voice occasionally drifts toward therapeutic abstraction (“even doubts could be forged into purpose”), but the embodied beats outweigh the lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is painterly and specific, but the “intimate aloofness” label is asserted more than embodied; the final choice to keep the secret is credible yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “tears glistening like dew” and “screaming tenderness” show contradictory impulses under pressure. The micro-choice to crack the vial cork is causally tied to her stated motive and carries visible cost (the empty cork on the rail). However, the fisherman remains off-stage, so relationship crucible and status dynamics do not apply; the arc is purely internal, yet still earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The navigator’s interiority is embodied and specific—“eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps” shows contradiction and flaw. Motivation to map loss is clear and drives every beat; the final smile is earned cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (soldering, lifting the censer) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s rational truffle-forager identity is vivid, but her “involuntary truthfulness” is asserted rather than dramatized; the interior contradiction between honesty and smuggling is stated, not embodied in micro-choices. The final decision to use the eye as communal mirror is earned by prior motive, yet the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marlowe is vivid—his frayed coat and boutonnière anchor a loner whose method of “reading” sea-gaps feels credible. Inner loneliness morphs from void to canvas, lending earned emotion to the final stance. Only mild abstraction around “stranger’s borrowed memory” dilutes edge.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s interiority is evocative but abstract; the “lingering promise” is stated more than embodied, and his decisive turn—choosing to return to the shop—lacks a dramatized cost on the page. The ants’ guidance is a vivid micro-choice, yet the final beat feels like thematic summary rather than earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid—her crown’s weight, the “pull of darker curiosity”—but her contradictory impulses (duty vs. dream) are stated more than dramatized until the orb kiss. The final renunciation earns its cost, yet earlier beats lean on lyric summary rather than micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is poetic but abstract; motives are declared (“capture the density of presence”) rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulses surface under pressure; the group acts in unison without individual stakes. The final vow feels communal, not personally costly to him.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority pulses with contradictory impulses; the chronicler’s present decision to “let jealousy convert to ink and trembling hand” emerges from earlier causality, not summary. Emotions are embodied by the heated scroll “humming in my palms” and the grave as “a marker for stories yet to tell,” showing earned stasis that forecloses the old self. A few “feral nostalgia” references edge toward label-speak but are quickly conjoined to embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena is internally consistent and the loss-of-smell condition re-weights every beat, yet her final decision—“You are more than metal”—leans poetic summary rather than earned act; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the final choice itself. The embodiment of grief and reverence is vivid but the cost is lightly sketched, keeping her arc from 9-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific; the scars-as-runes device shows contradictory impulses (heal vs. hide). Motivation is legible early and drives every beat. The final transformation of scars into luminous runes is earned by the ritual sequence, with visible cost in the dissolved feather and glowing arms. Some emotional phrasing edges toward lyric abstraction but never breaks character.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The exorcist’s guilt and need to apologize are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“imperfect miracles trembling like loose pages”) that blurs concrete motive. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is absent; pressure is purely internal. Micro-choices (arranging torn pages, whispering the apology) are present yet feel symbolic rather than tactical; cost is atmospheric, not embodied. Earned stasis is credible, but emotional contradiction is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The witness role is embodied through physical motion (walking out/journeying inward), giving her a credible interior arc, but the character’s contradictory impulses in scene are more implied than dramatized, keeping it shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“shoulders humming,” “tiny iron tooth that seemed to hum”), but the shepherd’s contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted; the final insight feels arrived at more than earned through visible micro-choices. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is character-specific and steady; once the “quiet surge, like embers sparking under ash” anchors the on-page calibration beat, the trait feels embodied. Cost is visible when leaving the farm with the laser in pocket, a tacit refusal to hoard control—Earned Stasis without exaggeration.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—mathematical certainty vs. gambling risk—are dramatized in the coin-on-seat beat and the ledger finale, but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “lucid contradiction” labels rather than embodied tension. The heart-attack aftermath is used as reflective ballast rather than active pressure. Closure choice (writing the new theorem) carries visible cost and is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara registers through curated isolation and bodily awareness—her deliberate estrangement compels higher-stakes choices as each call layers Lena’s grief onto the disc—yet the interiority dips into abstract reflection (“she had come to understand”) rather than on-the-body contradiction just before the pivot, dulling the hinge of earned renunciation. Still, the embodied pulse of the tunnel, glass, and disc sustains her as a lone, consistent presence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s interiority is rich and embodied—his “gently thorough gait” and the locket’s cold hinge against skin—but the story never forces him to a costly choice; he merely records. The promise whispered to the night is affective, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the tension is atmospheric rather than internal. Thus the characterization is vivid yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira emerges distinct—jocular amid ruin, driven by a loneliness-cure ambition that redefines empathy into logistics. Interiority flickers (“desperately jocular”) then flattens to slogan (“polite anarchy”), but her final micro-choice—trusting the next keeper with the lantern—earns Charged Poise, carrying a felt cost in the gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her skin “absorbs languages like a sponge,” her ring “glows faintly against her palm.” The final renunciation (leaving the stillpoint to map inner realms) is earned by the prior sensory journey and carries visible cost: she forfeits the external map for an internal one. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“confidently uncertain” paradox), but the pen’s agency overshadows the interpreter’s micro-choices; final renunciation is earned yet lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlen’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; contradictory impulses (“light and heavy” heart) are stated rather than embodied. The camera-as-relic and sign-language-as-music premise are evocative, yet his micro-choices remain generalized. Closure earns a modest renunciation cost—he vanishes, leaving the craft behind—but the emotional price feels more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“volcanic tenderness”), but the mentor promise remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, and the final turn to guardian feels more declared than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “quietly rebellious” hum and drumming embody motive—but the shift from defiance to communal conduit is asserted more than dramatized; the final beat lacks a visible cost to her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo’s stubborn curiosity and embodied ritual actions (whispering into the coin, pressing the key) give him texture, but interior contradiction is muted; the final smile feels slightly unearned because no genuine flaw or cost is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The guardian’s interiority is poetic but abstract; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices are dramatized. Its “silent empathy” remains a label rather than a felt tension that alters tactics. The final lowering of the mirror is a gesture, not a decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—protector vs. escapee—are embodied in her dock-work rhythm and the scrimshaw’s pulse; the final renunciation of violence carries visible cost when she releases the bone to the whale. Interiority is concrete, but a few stock phrases (“combat within herself”) slightly dilute specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s blank mask and interior hollowness are vividly rendered, but her “morally ambiguous purpose” is asserted, not dramatized; no concrete choice risks or costs her anything. The whittling narration is performative, yet we never see her weigh a trade-off or suffer a consequence for offering art under the mandate. The arc lands in a static “quiet redemption” that feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s aesthetic drive is vivid and embodied, but his interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the final step forward feels inevitable yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selene’s interior contradiction—trading doubt for wonder—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of perfect symmetry is earned through the reed’s cumulative cost. Her embodied perception (color through scent, cadence of shadows) is vivid and specific. The innocently cunning trait constrains tactics: she must barter sunrise pigment to coax each hue, a visible price. Flaws remain luminous rather than resolved, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell-ringer’s interiority is lyrically rendered and embodied (“powerfully gentle in their touch”), but the arc is more observational than choice-driven; the final lowering of the lamp is ritual, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers stained with copper and grief”), but the shift from despair to hope leans on abstract epiphanies (“she understood…”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of reopening to life is asserted more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the resistance of memory”), but the cartomancer’s contradictory impulses remain muted; her final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of her discovery is only gestured at, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The historian’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of rhythm is embodied in each footfall, and the final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost. Motivation (“forbidden knowledge”) is constant, but the contradictory pull between nostalgia and purification is dramatized rather than stated. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he realized purification was not…”) that slightly blunts the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” remains more archetype than individual. His contradictory impulses (regret vs. duty) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—recording his own hands—earns a modest cost, yet the emotional weight feels generalized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—self-respect vs. compassion—drives every micro-choice; the embodied tremor of her “fragile convictions” anchors the scene. The chameleon’s pulse of light and the tail-tip reattachment crystallize her earned change with visible cost. No stock phrasing; her voice stays tactile and specific. Minor slip: “balance is not a static point but a river” edges toward label-speak, blunting the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“meteor hush,” “chlorinated air”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the scar-reading motive is stated more than dramatized. Micro-choices (turning hourglass, tracing coffee ring) are present yet feel guided by external instruction rather than internal necessity. Closure is earned—accepting that wounds can hold hope—but the cost is diffuse rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“dust of forgotten reels swirled like slow snow”), but the gazer’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure alters tactics. The final “whispered goodbye” is a gesture, not a renunciation with visible cost. Motivation is consistent yet static—she seeks stored love but never confronts a live trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dreamer's interiority is lyrical but generic; no contradictory impulses surface in scene. Motivation ("to free trapped creativity") is stated, not dramatized through micro-choices. The final renunciation—leaving the instrument—earns mild poignancy yet lacks prior causality showing why this cost matters to him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyric and specific—"metronome of sighs," "pulse like a heart that refused to surrender"—but the guard’s contradictory impulses remain largely stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final smile and whispered charm mark a credible shift, yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied. Motivation is clear and consistent, but the emotional stakes lack a tangible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and embodied, but the philosopher’s contradictory impulses remain largely ornamental; the final “reclamation of internal wilderness” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure are scarce—he mostly listens and places the gear—so the arc feels more observational than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “unused courage” motif is told more than embodied. The moment she presses the star-stamp to the chest latch is a clear micro-choice that crystallizes her arc, yet prior beats lack contradictory impulses on the page. Emotional embodiment drifts toward poetic label (“pulse of hope”) rather than specific bodily tension. Closure cost is felt but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bellhop’s silent endurance and the guests’ shared apprehension are embodied through micro-gestures (lifting the bolt, watching the discoloration shift), but interior contradiction is muted; the final nod is credible yet the cost feels collective rather than personal, keeping the arc just shy of full individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The titan’s regally unpretentious presence is dramatized through micro-choices (brushing the crown, trembling fingers with the pellet) and embodied emotion under pressure; interior contradiction is shown when awe at the library wars with duty. Motivation intensifies from quiet purpose to vocal judgment, aligning with causal escalation. The only drag is a slight emotional tidy-up at fade-out; overall the portrait is vivid and singular.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her memory of first seeing bleached coral is visceral—but her agency is mostly observational until the final beat. The moment she realizes the atlas tear is a clue, not loss, crystallizes her arc, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt. Eli functions as mentor rather than crucible, so relationship pressure is minimal. Overall, a credible shift with visible stakes, though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“barefoot stargazer,” “awkward confidence bloom”), but the shift from passive listening to active leadership is asserted more than dramatized; the final vow feels slightly unearned because her prior micro-choices are mostly observational.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anara’s insurgent past and telepathic gift are embodied in her moss-whispering and memory-sacrifice; the contradiction between reverence and rebellion drives every beat. The final binding to the embryo’s gaze crystallizes her arc with visible cost (lost lullabies). Interiority is specific, but a few phrases (“seed of evolution,” “living bridge”) edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.6)
    Interior choices track lived trauma (somatic markers photo) but several arcs (pearl imagery, lighthouse past) float as decorative summary rather than scene-forced turns. Earned endurance at the end has cost on the page; motivation stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “luminescent ache”), and his contradictory impulse—fear of fragmentation vs. need to descend—drives the spiral descent. The final renunciation of the old self is earned by the prior tarot spiral and darkness ordeal. Minor slip: “crestfallen” is stated more than dramatized early on.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s “serene anger” is embodied in micro-choices—whispering to ink, standing tall after the spiral fades—yet the interior contradiction between calm and fury remains more asserted than dramatized. His final vow carries cost, but the shift from anger to purpose feels slightly smoothed rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—guardian vs. liberator—are embodied in the tremor she feels when the letter ignites; the cost of possible “frozen preservation” is named and felt. Interiority is specific (“the cold itself approved of the heat”) rather than diagnostic. The final smile and green shoots crystallize an earned, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s pacifist stance and inherited blade skill create a credible internal contradiction; her micro-choice to offer a rose petal instead of a weapon crystallizes her values. The boy’s compass moment supplies relational pressure, but his interior remains off-page. Motivation (“weave continuity”) is stated more than dramatized; the final handing of the scrap to the elder shows earned cost yet feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the fisher’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs him until the final spike-lift, so the change feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract summary (“solemn playfulness,” “weight of responsibility”) rather than embodied contradiction. The pen-nib choice is motivated, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s guilt-driven obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing lullabies with a silver needle, stitching amber to chassis—yet interior contradiction remains more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned and costly, but the moment of internal collision is narrated rather than shown under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is lyrically rendered and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain diffuse; the “unlearning” never collides with a specific, costly choice. The final renunciation of noise is felt more as atmospheric shift than character-driven forfeiture. Secondary pressure from the tile flake is present yet abstract, so status dynamics stay muted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal contradictions (“retrocognitively trapped”) are embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, tracing, whispering “Hearthsteel.” Renunciation is credible and feels costly; yet some interior monologue edges toward label language (“aberrant mercy” is repeated instead of dramatized), preventing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ghost’s yearning for one last encore anchors every choice; his memory-haunted interiority deepens beat by beat under surging synesthetic pressure, steering the final sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s skepticism and affection are embodied in her tactile calibration of LEDs and the micro-choice to test without drugs; the interior contradiction is palpable. The final “surge of purpose” is earned by the prior embodied trial and the cost of risking self-rewiring. Yet the shift from doubt to conduit feels slightly smoothed—more hopeful assertion than wrenching concession—keeping it from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“echoes of forgotten tides and buried feelings”), but the map-maker’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final release of the droplet, which feels more ritual than decision. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the cost of “becoming the voice of the unknown” is asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority glows—her hush, meticulous gestures, and bodily wonder around buttons and sand read as singular—but near-closure voice drifts into gentle summary (“realized her motivation…”) just when final cost should sting hardest.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    His guilt-burned contrition is embodied in ash-scarred skin and ritual winter glyph-writing; but the shift from guilt to redeemed hope happens almost entirely in summary, reducing earned cost that would clinch 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlen’s interiority is textured—needle as palimpsest promise, heartbeat syncing with river—but the “distill complexity” motive is stated more than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. Micro-choices (bowing head, slipping needle back) are present yet feel ritual rather than costly. Still, the Earned Stasis of accepting the river’s answer carries quiet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and consistent—her calloused hands, the lantern’s warmth against her palm—but the “fractured timelines” belief is asserted rather than dramatized as a contradictory impulse. The final choice to leave the lantern is credible, yet the cost feels generalized (“sharp gentleness”) rather than specific to her flaw or desire.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “protected vulnerability” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (adjusting the latch, kneeling on the ledge). Motivation is consistent yet lacks a sharp internal contradiction that would force a costlier decision; the final renunciation is gentle rather than wrenching. The heirloom tool and ritual rose anchor her lineage of caretaking, but stakes never truly bite her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically voiced yet remains anchored in tactile micro-choices (placing the sundial, feeling vibrations). The “contemporary of the sky-whale” claim is never tested or dramatized, so it functions as atmospheric label rather than motive force. Still, her arc from solitary reader to co-creator of a communal chorus is embodied in the final step onto the mist stair, carrying visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“notebook humming with unfinished vows” grounds her ghostwriter identity. The contradiction between keeping secrets and longing to release them is embodied when she whispers a letter into the spiral. Her final choice to guide the letters outward is earned by the temple’s sensory confirmation. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her private archive.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt a cautiously hopeful surge”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final “soft tone” transmits hope without visible personal cost, so the arc feels more symbolic than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative ("familiar wound") and the paradoxical "prudently adventurous" trait is dramatized when the explorer chooses to enter the narrowing corridor. The final renunciation—using the key as a guide for others rather than hoarding it—earns its cost. Yet the shift from claustrophobic dread to cosmic acceptance feels compressed; more embodied struggle in the passage would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—tactile cataloguing of quarry grains and echos—but the “dormant empathy” awakening reads like an externally imposed epiphany rather than an embodied re-weighting of choice. No micro-choice visibly alters her tactics after the tear falls, so the cost of the new-found empathy isn’t on the page. Traits align with action except the moment her compassion seals itself without causal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses (hope/dread) are embodied in trembling fingertips and the “nervous grin,” but the ancestor’s bravery is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve feels slightly pre-packaged rather than earned by visible interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    Fiddler is more emblem than person; interiority glimmers when he notices the wind as “inscribed letters” but remains mostly label-driven. No visible internal contradiction or mistake. Ending shift feels symbolic rather than earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arlen’s “polished calm” is embodied through steady micro-choices (pinning currency, quieting Maya) and a final renunciation that carries felt cost; interiority is consistent, though the father-legacy thread stays more summary than contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is poetically layered but drifts toward abstract self-report; her motives (heal via words, decode temple) are announced rather than pressed into concrete, costly micro-choices. The decisive act—sharing the burden aloud—carries some embodied tremor, yet the “heal the world with words” epiphany feels gifted rather than earned by struggle. Emotional contradiction appears mainly in summary, not in the crucible of live beats.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The druid’s interiority is embodied and specific—“eyes rimmed with frost,” “calm blade ready for battle”—and her contradictory impulses (guard truth vs. release it) play out in the seed’s pulse and the chant’s rhythm. The final renunciation—sealing the confession inside the seed—carries visible cost as the orchard bows and the lake sighs, earning her shift from war to peace.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“each breath a question”), but the visionary’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; her final choice to become “bridge” feels foregone rather than wrested from genuine flaw. Motivation is clear yet lacks visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maelia’s contradictory impulses—gentle speech against reckless action—are embodied in the soot-line pressed into the root; the final amber thread is earned by prior pacts and visibly costs her the card’s ash. Interiority stays concrete, but “holes in her soul” edges toward stock phrasing, slightly blunting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ex-roadie’s loss-direction-parallels are specific, embodied, and culminate in a quiet stasis—no false resolution. Emotions thrum (van, cloth, clatter) so interiority stays character-bound. One flaw: “confidently uncertain” surfaces as prompt echo rather than lived contradiction mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “kindly methodical hands” and the embodied shift from haunted ambition to compassionate cultivation anchor her arc. The contradiction between preserving knowledge and letting the spirit go is dramatized in the seed-planting beat, and her final choice to descend carries visible cost (leaving the arbor’s safety). Minor drift: the “physics of transition” desire is stated more than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The librarian’s interiority is poetic but abstract; his motives (“preserve wonder in routine”) are declared rather than embodied in micro-choices. The moment he decides to let his own identity migrate is too lightly sketched to feel earned. Still, the contradiction he accepts—melting the key into the creel—carries visible cost and aligns with his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but drifts into generic spiritual language (“walls between hearts,” “chorus of quiet reverence”) that flattens contradiction. Her single decisive act—naming the lost—lacks prior micro-choices that show her risking personal exposure; the warmth in her palm is the only embodied cost. The shift from inspector to “keeper of light” is declared, not dramatized through visible stakes or error. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; still, the arc feels safely hedged rather than flawed and tested.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is embodied (patch tape memory, accordion breath) and stakes escalate to a credible renunciation: “I will walk this path again.” Flawed passivity is balanced by the chronicler’s compulsion to map regret. Backstory is anchored to present micro-choices (tracing graffiti, drawing in mud). No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority remains abstract; “cautious exuberance” repeats without embodiment. The veiled dreamer acts but her choices lack contradiction or visible cost. No micro-choice in the climax—reaching for the petal is too smooth to register as character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the mulberry ache anchors her choices. The telepathic bond with vines and the coffee-stain divination are specific, character-bound abilities that alter tactics. The final renunciation—choosing the vines’ dissent—carries visible cost as the envoy lowers his sword and the empire yields. Only the envoy’s abrupt empathy feels slightly under-motivated, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is evocative but leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction; the “promise to the stillness” is the only micro-choice with visible cost, and even that is abstract. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Traits remain consistent, but the arc feels more symbolic than psychologically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s caretaker identity is vivid in action, but interiority drifts toward generic “cycle of rebirth” therapy-speak; the forgiveness arc is asserted more than dramatized, softening the cost of her decisive turn at the altar.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—“sincerely insincere”—is dramatized through her tallying of wind-chime whispers and the deliberate unhooking of the decree; the embodied cost is the shard pressed to her chest at the end. Motivation stays consistent: protect nuance while weaponizing honesty. The magistrate’s off-stage presence weakens relationship-as-crucible pressure, but Mara’s micro-choices under doubt’s cloak earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s reverse-aging curse and her wish to turn it into a gift are stated early and color every beat; the final renunciation—choosing to teach rather than grasp eternal youth—carries visible cost. Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“reverse aging could become a gift rather than a curse”). Embodied emotion is strongest when she feels the magnetic pull “like sycamore breath,” grounding her paradoxical patience.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the skimmer’s “weathered resolve” is stated more than embodied. No contradictory impulses surface in scene—she glides from reverence to mastery without friction. The pledge of continuity is a gesture, not a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selric’s interior contradiction—yearning for quiet brilliance while fearing inadequacy—drives every beat; the unstrapping and palm-to-keystone micro-choices crystallize his shift from self-doubt to earned humility with visible cost (the glow he once hid now warms the spire). No stock phrasing; embodied emotion in “faint chime” footfalls and heartbeat-synced pulse. Flaw (soft-glow magic) complicates choices and is not tidily resolved. Meets 9+ quick test except for slight over-articulation of “sacred in the simple” near end.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s interiority leans poetic but stays specific to the quest for the “color of sound.” The contradiction between yearning for hidden knowledge while fearing its cost surfaces in his micro-choice to hide behind truth. However, embodied emotion slips into abstract lyricism at climax—“luminous vow fulfilled”—costing a fractional intensity hit.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “quietly enthusiastic” pulse undercuts cosmic fatalism—but the final alignment feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses; no embodied cost is dramatized beyond a hushed echo.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—“cloak dripping with the sighs of unkept promises” grounds grief in tactile image. The contradiction between her reaper identity and tender need to name fears is dramatized through micro-choices (lifting the atlas page, whispering each name). The final remembrance of the sailor’s name carries visible cost: her own luminous dissolution. Only slight reserve: the sailor remains abstract, blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mage’s interiority is vivid—his “brittle devotion” and “lukewarm magic” are embodied in the way the bell’s fissures expand under tepid heat. Micro-choices (recording each drip, humming the weld) reveal a hierarchy of values and cost. The final smile is earned because the prior pattern of fragile persistence is dramatized, not asserted. One notch below 9.0 only because the emotional contradiction could be sharper in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Caitlyn’s vigilance and quiet observational ethic are embodied in gait and gaze, but the interior contradiction between myth-busting duty and inherited storytelling craft remains summary; the final “smile” feels unearned because the cost of renouncing her own myth-spinning past is never dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selene’s interior contradiction—cold skepticism warring with hidden sentiment—drives every beat: thawing the crystal is a choice that exacts visible emotional cost, and her final spiral sealing earns renunciation with price. One significant tightening, stance earned, closure intact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the seeker's tactile memory and silent promise to the fallen skyfarer anchor motivation. The final nod to the crew crystallizes earned endurance, though the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—calm vs fury—drives the decisive slice, but the “ego death survivor” label stays abstract; embodied emotion arrives only in the final surge. The micro-choice to slice the jar is earned, yet the Duplicate’s agency remains off-stage, muting relationship crucible. Backstory is minimal and anchored, so no BRR breach.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her whispered promise to the seed is embodied and stakes her identity—but the story never tests her limits or flaws; she orchestrates rather than suffers. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final triumph feels pre-ordained, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conductor’s contradictory impulses—grief and hope—are embodied in the trembling pull-cord and half-sung lullaby, but the interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction rather than concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (lowering the blower) is earned by the prior sonic ritual, yet the cost feels more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.7)
    Vivid interiority ("claws brushing spines," "rusted syllables") shows embodied contradiction between feral instinct and archive caretaker; the final moment of opening a new wing is earned by every prior hesitation and carries a felt cost of accepting uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“stoically sensitive” shows in how he feels each ember’s sigh), but the arc leans on thematic assertion rather than a visible flaw that compounds; the cost is felt yet abstract, not dramatized as a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selin's interiority is vivid and embodied ("treated whispers of starlight as practical maps"), but the shift from skeptical interpreter to trusting engineer feels slightly smoothed; the cost of abandoning linear-time assumptions is asserted rather than dramatized in body or risk. Micro-choices (climbing, slotting the shard, whispering intent) are specific, yet the emotional contradiction between data discipline and wonder could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lio’s resilient grin remains surface-level, but the contradiction between his public optimism and private drive to bend time is not embodied in-scene; the final reversal is narrated rather than dramatized through visible choice and body.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“unsettlingly calm,” “texture of connection”), but the architect’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. The final smile is earned, yet the cost is only implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s “balancedly curious” trait is stated repeatedly but only once—when she notes the anchor link’s mass shift—does it visibly constrain a choice. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward summary (“she felt the pull…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final whispered promise is earned by prior beats but lacks a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Protagonist’s relentless curiosity is embodied through immediate micro-choices—tuning, tracing, promising—rather than abstract labels; the final choice to carry the voice beyond death earns emotional cost in a quiet Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied in shallow breath and trembling hands; her vow to “stand by the unremembered” is dramatized when she risks phase-stranding to recover the codex. The final burial of the book is a credible renunciation that costs her future access, sealing the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—her pulse against glass, the shard’s warmth—yet the “wisdom from failure” motive is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because we never see her weigh an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“copper veins in his skin tingled”), motives intensify under pressure, and the final renunciation—sealing the language inside the canyon—carries visible cost. The contradiction between preserving and imprisoning the tongue is dramatized, not stated. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“frost that clung…a kind of hope that had been frozen”), but the researcher’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final renunciation (“tucked the empty pocket…as a promise”) is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    A vivid, specific persona whose embodied discipline (heart-rhythm bowing) undercuts the melodrama and keeps interiority concrete; final renunciation lands with palpable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Milo’s interiority is vivid—“respectfully rebellious gait,” “quiet contest”—but the contradictory impulses (obedience vs. rebellion) are stated more than dramatized; the final choice to release the storm and slip the truce envelope is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her hands “moving like prayer,” her song rising “like a gentle wind”—but the story leans on lyrical summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The final choice to descend the new staircase is motivated, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, her craft-as-listening identity is specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (scarf fluttering like a forgotten stanza), but her choices remain observational; the reawakening happens *through* her rather than *by* her. The final beat—tucking the scarf and logging the event—shows a quiet stewardship that forecloses no path, so the cost is diffuse. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. renunciation) are stated rather than embodied in micro-choice. The final “quiet joy” is felt but not paid for by an on-page forfeiture. Secondary character Lio appears only as witness, adding no crucible pressure. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts stance, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear interior longing anchors the locksmith’s actions, yet reliance on lyrical summary (“improbable longing”) weakens embodied contradiction under peak pressure. Embodied tremor in untying the lock is present, but epiphanies arrive through narration rather than dramatized internal split, limiting emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    Folklorist’s curiosity is credibly obsessive but mostly descriptive; final memory-restoration choice is felt as inevitable, though her interior stakes peak early and stay flat until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (mentor resilience) is legible, and interior contradictions appear in her combative tenderness, yet several beats compress into summary rather than embodied choice, muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pruner’s reverence and creative hunger are palpable, but choices remain largely ceremonial; the vow and planting are acts of faith rather than tested decisions with visible cost. Interiority is lyrical yet abstract, lacking embodied contradiction under pressure. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief-gleaner vocation is vivid and embodied—every wrist-twist with the needle anchors her interior stakes. One flaw: “restless spirits found a place to rest” summarizes an earned payoff already dramatized, dulling the final beat. Otherwise motives feel consistent, interior contradictions present but not foregrounded; still, the price is felt as she tucks the revived mask away.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling arm,” “shielded openness”), but the map-framer’s contradictory impulses remain muted; her final act of aligning footage feels inevitable yet lacks a palpable cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is consistent, yet the absence of a second character or status shift limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mort’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his heartbeat syncing with the snow globe’s ticking—but the “physics of letting go” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final release of the globe is earned by prior handling, yet the contradiction between analytic detachment and emotional surrender is only implied, not enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The balladeer is given poetic interiority, but emotional embodiment remains vague—"wandering longing" is not embodied. Motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is stated, not felt via contradictory choice-cost. Micro-choice at the tulip beat shows movement yet lacks felt cost on his own stake.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Ascending Servant embodies a gentle, self-abnegating resolve that quietly re-charges every beat he enters: his decision to reopen the diary via the goggles sets the central sequence in motion; the same detachment steers the moment of lifting the joy-filled jars and then returning the goggles, each choice visibly shifting the stakes of both personal cost and communal joy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aria’s categorising clouds by emotion is a consistent lens for her interior; the quiet endurance at the end forecloses future flights and shows felt cost, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied in tactile pigment work and the coin’s grooves; her blindness and drive to “mirror the sky” create a credible contradiction that culminates in pressing the coin into wet plaster—an earned, costly gesture that forecloses escape. The flaw of blindness is not merely stated but shapes every micro-choice. Minor slip: “face blind eyes finally seeing” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s diligent curiosity is vividly embodied through tactile close-work at the chart table and micro-choices with the hopscotch board; each annotation and chalk route manifests her traits. Interior contradictions surface—wonder vs fear of draining the ship—and propel the final act. The earned stasis feels credible: she succeeds yet recognizes the cost of tethering living light. Minor over-reliance on labels like “quiet pride” keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “driftwood nostalgia” and “rhythm of repair” are evocative yet remain labels. The locksmith’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear of endless task) flicker but never collide in a single beat. Micro-choice to whisper the prophecy line is clean and earns the gear’s click, yet the cost feels diffuse—more mood than forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s altruism is stated but never tested; she drifts and whispers without interior contradiction or visible cost. The villagers’ shift from strangers to family is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. No single character’s flaw or desire drives the climax; the bell-ringing is collective and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the cracked puppet head as mirror—but the “lullaby” motive remains abstract until the final whisper, softening the cost. Still, her embodied awe and the moment of self-repair through the puppet’s glow earn the renunciation of return.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ash on my tongue”), but the caretaker’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is felt yet causally under-motivated by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—foam patterns as polymer lattices, grief embodied in the empty chrysalis. Her micro-choices (kneeling, weaving reeds, recording bubbles) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final laughter and promise show earned change with visible cost. One slip: “loosened grief” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vendor’s motive—“to find the place where stories begin”—is stated but never tested or contradicted; he performs the ritual flawlessly and exits unchanged. No interior contradiction or embodied cost surfaces; the child arrives too late to pressure him. The final smile feels unearned because the absence he measures never endangers or redefines him.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lir’s sensory gift and mission are clear, but interiority drifts toward lyrical abstraction (“taste of remorse…bright citrus”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final act of tasting/removing grief is dramatized yet the cost feels diffuse because no prior flaw or fear is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The librarian makes a visible choice—dropping the weight to summon the elevators—but the interior contradiction (“to heal scars with art” vs practical logistics) is asserted not dramatized. Embodied emotion flares in the conducting moment, yet later feelings are relayed (“surge of vigorous tenderness”) rather than lived in body. Earned stasis relies on symbolic chorus rather than demonstrated personal cost, leaving motivation partially intact but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aria’s “chaotically precise” mind is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—aligning shards, whispering equations, steadying her palm—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The interior contradiction (logic vs wonder) is present but stays slightly abstract; the final renunciation (“must revive, not only record”) is earned yet stated more than dramatized. Cost is felt in the tremor and the risk of fracture, but the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora's interiority remains abstract ("a quiet fire that urged," "latent blaze stir") without embodiment; prism-mindedness never translates to refracted internal contradictions. Micro-choices are missing except the final silent promise. Motivation is explicit but lacks texture, keeping arc tidy rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior motive (“fierce need to create”) and embodied emotion sustain through tactile craft; micro-choices of reed placement and crack-reading reveal hierarchy of values; quill dance of hedgehog supplies visible cost. Yet the closing smile risks epiphany-summary (“realized that empathy in motion…”) without immediate, specific embodied repercussion, softening full contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The exile’s interiority (“felt hopeful melancholy swell”) is embodied and specific, the basalt stone’s micro-choices anchor emotional conflict, and the final renunciation—accepting lingering sorrow as compass—carries clear cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pacifist’s motive to “catalog silence” is stated early, but interiority stays lyrical rather than contradictory; no embodied cost is dramatized when the diary opens. The final vow is sincere yet abstract, lacking a visible forfeiture that would foreclose a path. Micro-choices (bowing, whispering names) are performative gestures rather than stakes-altering decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory gift and doodle ritual are embodied—but her arc is more observational than choice-driven; the final beat is a communal epiphany rather than a personal cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; serenity is affirmed, not tested. The corpse flower’s bloom feels inevitable, not earned by a crucible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trust in water-flow navigation and her awe at the inversion feel embodied. The moment she chooses to release the arrow tip into the basin crystallizes her shift from seeker to steward, paying the cost of relinquishing power. Yet the stakes of that renunciation could be sharper if we felt what she personally forfeits beyond mission success.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara's interior contradiction—seeking scientific clarity yet using a talismanic patch—gives immediate specificity; her final whispered command embodies the "cultivate foresight" motif with visible cost (she surrenders the data and stands alone). Still, the prose flirts with stock metaphors ("shadows like hopeful fingers") and the compass patch remains more emblem than embodied tool during action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bell ringer embodies wonder but the “to certify wonder as essential” mandate is told not earned; interiority is lush yet choices remain abstract. Her synesthetic gift operates more as poetic filter than costly constraint; no concrete trade-off visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath “avalanchingly quiet” and the flute’s “silence louder than any trumpet” reveal contradictory impulses. Motivation (harvest failure-insight) drives every micro-choice, and the final renunciation—turning the flute upside-down to let silence serve—earns its cost. Yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse aligning with the press rhythm is embodied—but the borrowed-personality trait is asserted more than dramatized; no single poet’s cadence is shown altering a concrete choice. The final renunciation (to keep disorienting herself) is credible and carries felt cost, yet the prior beats do not stage contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Courier is credibly anxious, interiority vivid; shepherd & girl momentarily distinct. Mentally anchored choices resonate (“quickened his pace”) but no deep contradiction pushes final decision, so closure feels mild earned stasis rather than hard cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor vs. open-hearted grief—is embodied in the micro-choice to “reach out, not to touch,” a gesture that crystallizes her arc. The prism’s pulse of grief lands as a credible externalization of her own buried sorrow, earning the final acceptance of emotional absorption. Cost is felt: she steps onto an unknown road carrying the traveler’s loss. Minor slip: “firmly grounded” is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “latent sacrifice” is announced more than embodied until the final beat, where the cost is felt but not dramatized in action. Her choices—placing puzzle pieces, threading the bead—are clear micro-choices, yet the contradiction between longing and renunciation stays summary-level. The earned stasis lands, but the emotional specificity could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority stays concrete—“rubble of his past failures pulse like heartbeats”—and the memory-for-silk barter externalizes flaw. Yet the “meek” trait is asserted, not shown contradicting bold descent; no micro-choice under pressure reveals fresh contradiction before the silk is simply granted. Closure earns credible endurance, but the arc rides summary more than scene, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her sensory maps and the shard’s pulse are felt in her body. Motivation (uncover withheld truth) is clear and escalates to the decisive act of freeing the crew. The final renunciation of the shard’s power carries visible cost: the bay’s walls dissolve and the shard itself is lost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marek’s quiet diligence and sensorial memory are embodied through tactile ritual—the carvings, the pocketing of warmed glass—so interior contradiction feels alive. Yet his final “surge of purpose” edges close to an unearned epiphany; we see the ache, not the exact choice that prices that ache.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s centuries-long vigil and her whispered vow give her interiority weight, yet the herald remains a cipher whose laughter never crystallizes into motive or contradiction; the final choice is earned but the relationship crucible is under-used.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; contradictions shimmer on the page yet never tighten into a visceral choice beyond pledging to “guard” and “illuminate.” The donor-heart beats with externalized metaphor rather than embodied urgency, leaving the final stasis elegant but cost-adjacent rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s interiority is vivid—his palm on the brass, the pulse matching his own sorrow—but the “trees witness” motive is asserted rather than embodied in choice; the final calm is felt yet not paid for by a visible renunciation or flaw confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “patchwork of distant lives” never crystallizes into a specific contradiction that forces a visible choice. The final promise to guard forever is voiced, not embodied, so the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized. Still, her embodied singing and the orchard’s response give enough micro-action to sustain a single POV arc.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; the recluse’s “keenly empathetic” trait is asserted rather than embodied in decisive micro-choices. The final insight—carrying grief while leaving the attic—earns some closure cost, yet the abandonment of the friend remains off-stage and abstract, muting felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“he felt the tenuous absolution that came from holding something both lost and present”), but the character’s choices remain largely observational; the final offering to the empty chair is a micro-choice rather than a decisive turn, so the earned cost feels mild.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“precision of a surgeon cataloguing veins”), but the childhood motive is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, yet the contradiction between duty and pilgrimage remains more stated than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is embodied and specific—"comforting unease that settled like a soft blanket"—but the “sound of trust breaking” motivation is asserted rather than dramatized; the final choice (watch on table) is a gesture, not a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Arin’s luminous skepticism is signaled but never tested; he tastes the wind and records data, yet no contradictory impulse or visible cost alters his stance. Interiority is poetic but generic, lacking idiosyncratic texture. The final “strange kinship” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the arc feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—yearning to unlock creativity yet fearing the cost—are embodied in her trembling charcoal strokes and the hidden mirror. The micro-choice to align the mirror’s reflection with the lock’s teeth crystallizes her arc and seals the fracture in her inspiration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motive—reignite candor to heal a shattered society—is stated rather than embodied. Internal contradiction surfaces only once: she refuses the council yet the action carries no body-felt cost (grey metal aside). Micro-choices catalog texts rather than press against personal stakes. Character voice remains gorgeously textured, but the culminating decision lacks visible sacrifice; the closure reads more symbolic than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tuner registers as a single POV figure sustained through embodied motion; motivation is clear, interiority is concrete (“he smiles, feeling the muted vigor”). The arc is quiet renunciation—choosing silence over speech—but the interior contradiction and visible cost remain subdued, keeping it from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vira’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic caretaker vs. cold machine—are embodied in her tactile tending of roses and the whispered code to the living box; the final smile-gesture crystallizes earned change with visible cost (static dissolved, vigilance burned away).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s interiority is gentle but generic; her “discerning” trait is asserted, not embodied. The decisive act—placing the locket on the bench—reads as symbolic rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction. No cost is dramatized; the emotional arc flattens into affirmation. The boy’s arrival repeats the pattern without deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene’s interiority is vivid—her braid singing, her dance encoding weakness—but the “calm defiance” trait is asserted more than embodied in contradictory micro-choices; the final sealing of the crystal feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her bones register gravity’s tug, her breath steadies as she exhaumes memory; yet the back-to-back epiphanies at the end slide toward declarative insight rather than a last embodied cost, preventing full Earned-Stasis burnish.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Solid interiority—the summoner’s tactile handling of the crane wing and the hush-chant embody her motive—but no contradictory impulses surface mid-scene; desire is monolithic. Micro-choices (align wing to water, exhale silence) are character-true yet not stressed by palpable error or flaw. Earned Stasis closure shows cost (crane now secret beacon), satisfying causality if thin.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's ghostly presence is atmospherically haunting yet functionally vague; her choices do not visibly alter outcomes beyond poetic invitation. The interiority stays lyrical, but the motivational arrow—why she consents to tutor after death—remains abstract. The decisive change in the narrator's goal is credible: from decoding sigils to learning living stone language. Cost is felt, yet it is narrated rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lira’s interior contradiction – skepticism mixed with yearning for the seashell’s song – is vivid, embodied, and grows under pressure; the renunciation (accepting solitude as its own lighthouse) is earned. Yet the “archive of quarantined memory” remains an abstract label; no contradiction within that concept is dramatized in-scene, blunting flaw and cost specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses to weaponize versus heal with forgery play out in embodied micro-choices (key against thorn, script onto marble). The final renunciation of “calibrated treason” carries visible cost as the key dissolves and the thorn’s glow fades, earning her quiet resolve. Minor slip: “wisely enduring” is asserted more than dramatized until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the singer’s contradictory impulses—yearning to free the echoes yet fearing their cost—surface in the cavern beat. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies toward the final choice to merge the shells. The only gap: the “richly perceptive” trait is asserted rather than tested in scene, keeping it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives (“expose hidden purity”) stay stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the whisperer’s final resolve feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied, but the philosopher’s choices remain largely observational; the “mending” of memory is symbolic rather than dramatized, so the felt cost is muted. Motivation is clear—appreciation of hidden effort—but never collides with a contradictory impulse that forces a visible trade-off. The final promise to return reads as continuation, not renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s drive to excavate truth is clear and consistent, but interiority stays at surface level—no contradictory impulses shown under pressure. The final “stillpoint” realization lands as an abstract epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; her smile feels generic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The visionary’s interiority is lyrically rich but abstract; his motives (“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) are declared rather than embodied in discrete, pressured choices. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; the final smile feels bestowed rather than earned through visible cost. Character operates more as mythic vessel than individual psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the “wistful gaze”—but the shift from solitary collector to communal teacher happens in summary rather than a single, pressured choice; the child’s arrival is external catalyst rather than earned crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—logic vs. music—drives every beat; her embodied tremor at 432 Hz and tear at the end show cost. The “logically emotional” trait is dramatized, not labeled. Only minor slip: the council’s off-stage hand-off weakens status pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“calm fire that burned just enough to keep the cold at bay”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely parallel rather than simultaneous; the final renunciation feels earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the “fortified vulnerability” is asserted more than dramatized; her micro-choices (tracing the pipe, turning the valve) align with motive yet lack a contradictory impulse that would sharpen the cost. The mentor memory is brief and cues present action, satisfying BRR, but the emotional contradiction remains underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich; chaplain’s contradictory mercy-vs-temptation pulses inside the repair beats. Embodied emotion sits in finger-tracing brass and heartbeat-sync hum, but the shopkeeper remains generic; secondary character pressure mild.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s irreverent curiosity is embodied in every micro-choice—steering, joking with gears, logging the bell’s silent ring—yet the interior contradiction between yearning and prank never sharpens into a visible cost; the algorithm swells, but Mara herself feels untouched at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lia’s interiority is vivid—her “brightly attentive” stance is embodied in micro-choices like fabricating the tribute and deliberately letting the lie spread. The shift from abstract curiosity to custodial vow carries visible cost: she accepts perpetual guardianship of the hidden corridors. Flaw is subtle but present: her readiness to deceive the network mirrors the crew’s own gambit, compounding risk. The final renunciation (open-ended custodianship) is earned and forecloses rest.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“shadow-laced,” “calmly intuitive”) but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation—choosing shared empathy over solitary guardianship—earns its cost through the orchard’s slow greening, yet the peacekeeper’s flaws or limits are never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“skin felt thinner”), but the shift from death-seeker to life-listener is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve is credible yet leans on summary rather than a visible micro-choice that costs something concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentinel’s interiority is textured—his coat “dusted with the scent of fermenting grapes” and the trembling burnt edge embody his solitude—but the shift from lonely watcher to “bridge between fire and earth” is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the prior beats show observation rather than decisive micro-choices that visibly cost him.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Keeper’s motivation—to preserve the echo of wisdom—remains abstract; no interior contradiction or embodied cost is dramatized. His single on-page action (consecrating the space) is performed with calm certainty rather than under pressure, so no visible trade-off or flaw complicates it. The villagers’ questions merely echo the theme rather than test him. Earned change is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s calm is embodied in micro-choices—scanning walls, whispering promises—but her interior contradiction (healer vs. archivist) stays summary. The final feather gesture crystallizes her stance with visible cost, yet the villagers remain off-page chorus, so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—her “weathered innocence” and “reticent heart” are embodied in micro-choices like folding the page as an offering. The contradiction between clinging to printed words and accepting their eclipse is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation (leaving the page, accepting impermanence) carries visible cost and is earned by the crystal’s testimony. Minor slip: the phrase “weathered innocence” is repeated without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prophet’s interior contradiction—yearning to remember while fated to forget—drives every beat; the embodied ache of “half-remembered songs” and the micro-choice to record the aging-hum onto a battered cassette anchor motive. Yet the driftwood markers feel more scenic than tactical, and the final smile reads slightly tidy given the prior fatalism.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sage’s interiority is vivid—his “hands were changelessly constant” and he “whispered a thank-you to the wind”—but the contradiction between his unwavering steadiness and the need to surrender excess spin is only asserted, not dramatized in a moment of visible struggle. The cost is felt in the final image, yet the micro-choice that proves his flaw is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and consistent, but her “decisively kind” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final chord lands as earned renunciation yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is specific—her “quietly deliberate” trait is embodied in the tactile tracing of glyphs and the pause to listen for the key’s tick. Motivation (shadow riddle) is rooted in childhood and intensifies through the ritual. The final choice to seal the awakenings costs her the next mystery, giving earned stasis. Minor: no contradictory impulse shown mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bone-setting metaphor channels interiority; "tingled at the prospect" merges skepticism with tactile memory. Shifts from past wrist repair to present spine repair show earned skill evolving. Renunciation in the final paragraph—that she keeps the tooth rather than use it—crystallizes contradiction: belief purchased by self-limitation. Only the "shrewdly innocent" tag feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the pearl of stillness functions more as mantra than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (placing glass, polishing) are present yet feel ritualized rather than pressured. Motivation is clear—share light without fire—but the cost is diffuse, not personally wounding. Earned stasis is achieved, but the emotional price is generalized rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her pulse syncing with the icicle drip, the pendant warming against her skin—but the “protected vulnerability” remains more asserted than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene, so the final beat feels gently inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific, but the conflicted novelist’s doubt is summarized rather than embodied in a decisive micro-choice; the final “solemn promise” feels asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the vine, the “copper-capped finger”—but her contradictory impulses (tinkerer vs guardian) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final vow lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (pollen sealing her shoulders), yet the shift from curiosity to custodian feels slightly smoothed rather than struggled.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers moving like glacier ice”), but the alchemist’s contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the covenant is declared rather than dramatized. Micro-choices (spiral placement, palm to plate) are present yet feel ritualized rather than pressured. The Earned Stasis lands, but the cost is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Corin’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingertip tracing, the “quiet triumph,” the inward turn on the paradox of capture—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; no single moment shows simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure. The final stance (library not prison) is earned by prior causality yet feels gently intellectual rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The weaver’s interiority is richly textured and embodied, but her motive remains a static “singular purpose” voiced like exposition without visible contradiction or flaw under pressure; the emotional arc is serene rather than conflicted, so renunciation feels gently inevitable instead of costly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hands “cradling an ash wood carving blank as if it were a newborn memory” shows contradiction between grief and creation. The micro-choice to seal sap with glass crystallizes her shift from mourning to stewardship, paying a felt cost (the softened roar). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to regret while bargaining for wonder—are embodied in her tactile handling of the camera wheel and the spiral of story-shards; the final renunciation (“I will carry these stories forward”) is earned and carries visible cost as the ghost thins and the lagoon stills. Interiority is specific, avoiding label-speak; her chronologically scrambled memory manifests in micro-choices (collecting future birthdays) rather than exposition. The single relationship (with her ghost) functions as crucible, forcing the trade that reconfigures both selves. Flaws (chronic regret, temporal disorientation) directly complicate tactics and shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete—“stoic wonder” embodied in brass, dust, humming panels—but lacks contradictory impulse at critical beats; the final smile feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“excruciatingly gentle” as tactile sensation), but the final choice to inscribe memories is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices. The abandoned dream functions as a consistent motive, yet its reconciliation arrives via lyrical assertion rather than a visible, irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction (“serene upheaval,” “architecture of lies”) without embodied contradiction; the sundial use is a clear micro-choice that aligns motive and action, yet the final resolve feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Interiority favors lyric evocation over embodied choice—motions trace the fog and rope but not contradictory impulse; motivation clear but never visibly taxed; final endurance is poetic rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is mostly atmospheric and thematic rather than action-forcing; traveler’s motives are visible but don’t tighten into concrete micro-choices, so credible change feels summary rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“eyes reflecting a world more gear than garden”), but the prince’s shift from passive regret to active bridge feels slightly abstract; the cost is stated rather than embodied in a final micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her lineage’s fire memory pulses in every step—but the “gracefully alert” label never constrains a choice; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s luminous skepticism is embodied in her cautious tracing of symbols and the moment she “inhaled the hush,” yet her interior contradiction—doubt versus the act of belief in the ritual—stays more asserted than dramatized. The final smile and pledge of guardianship register as earned renunciation with visible cost, but earlier beats lean on abstract resolve rather than micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“weight of every generation’s sigh”), but the sentimentalist’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final release of the gear, which feels more ritual than wrenching. The generational vow supplies motive, yet the cost is diffuse—glow without burn—so the renunciation reads as serene rather than costly. Still, the voice is singular and the emotional layering is textured enough to lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliam’s interiority is vivid—his “fiercely meditative river” mind and embodied shivering of stone—but the shift from passive observer to active carver is more asserted than dramatized; the final carving choice lacks a visible, on-page cost that would foreclose an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s ethical diligence is embodied in tactile micro-choices—aligning the rake handle, whispering to the tide—yet the interior contradiction between her desire for absolution and the endless task is only asserted, not dramatized in scene. The final promise feels earned but lacks a visible cost that would deepen the flaw/compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gardener’s interiority is lyrical but thin; we feel his “blitheness” more than any contradiction. The moment he traces the circle with his thumb crystallizes motive and cost, yet prior beats lean on abstract “intentions” rather than embodied tension. Still, the final renunciation—sealing the case with a promise—earns its quiet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartographer’s interior contradiction—embracing ignorance as a creative tool—remains abstract; no embodied moment shows him doubting his lattice. His final humility is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is thistled-calm and embodied, but the final choice to become “bridge” feels slightly abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page, only stated. The ledger transcription is a concrete micro-choice that links motive to action, yet the cost remains atmospheric rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the protagonist’s contradictory impulses (to preserve yet release the emotion) play out in micro-choices—sprinkling powder, aligning mask shards, pressing palm to floor. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies toward the final crystallization. The mask’s removal and the porcelain snowfall form a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only slight reserve: the “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” label feels more epithet than lived identity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“abrasive calm” as lived contradiction), but the final shift from agonizing to chorus-of-truths feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The teacher’s interiority is vivid—her “expectantly resigned” stance threads through the scene—but her micro-choices remain largely observational; the decisive invitation to the child and veteran is under-motivated, arriving as grace rather than earned tactic. Embodied emotion (dust settling on tomes, shoulders loosening) is strong, yet the final renunciation lacks a palpable personal cost beyond hope.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories in broth, whispering to vines—yet her contradictory impulses (hope vs. ruin) remain mostly parallel rather than colliding in-scene; the final smile feels earned but the cost is more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s involuntary truth-telling is embodied in her trembling voice when she reads the riddle aloud, but the trait never forces a costly micro-choice; her confession to the drone is redundant because the drone already knows. The interior contradiction is hinted at (hope vs. fear of silence) yet never enacted in a beat that alters tactics. Closure is earned through realization rather than a decision that costs her anything visible.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is distinct and embodied (“restless mind”), yet the protagonist stays largely in receptive mode; micro-choices feel light, so the internal cost at closure leans reflective rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    The living statue’s motive—welcoming nuance into ossified certainty—is stated but never embodied in a specific, costly choice; its telepathy is omnipresent yet undifferentiated, and the “incisively kind” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradiction or visible trade-off. No interior contradiction surfaces under pressure; the statue merely orchestrates rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aric’s grim optimism is embodied in tactile micro-choices—rolling the dice, adjusting the bronze frame—yet the interior contradiction between hope and darkness is asserted more than dramatized. The shift from “capture the missed chance” to “honor its persistence” is credible but compressed; the cost is felt in the final image of the chipped die facing up, though the emotional price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s insomnia and hopefulness are embodied in tactile brushwork and moonlit ritual, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mind forever wandering”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the final renunciation of rest is implied, not dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s desire to “rescue dying arts” is clear and embodied in the bread-ritual, but her interior contradictions remain abstract; the mute potter and vanished poet are named yet never act on-page, so pressure is carried by summary rather than relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clock maker’s interiority is vivid—his “bleak exhilaration” pulses through embodied choices—but the final vanishing feels slightly unmotivated; no prior beat shows him relinquishing human ties, so the cost reads abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice to swallow the clasp and utter “vanish” feels driven by symbolic logic rather than earned character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“eyes traced the horizon as if reading a hidden script”), but the prophet’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no moment of genuine struggle or flaw complicates his dub. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final renunciation lacks a felt personal cost—only the orchard hums in gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet current beneath the city’s bright glare” and the embodied dread that “dissolves into quiet resolve” anchor her arc. Motivation (question the watchers to save the city) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices: tracing shell ridges, blowing the whistle, sealing the mosaic. The final renunciation—vowing to keep listening—earns its cost by the prior discovery that the city had stopped listening. Flaw: the shift from “question” to “promise” is slightly under-dramatized in a single clause.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen’s interiority is vivid—“emotionally rational” shows in how he weighs the letter’s glow against the ivy’s retreat—but the final beat is more epiphanic than earned; the shift from scholar to beacon-keeper feels declared rather than paid for in prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in the trembling hand that still writes; the contradiction is present but not fully exploited. Her vow to return supplies a credible renunciation with felt cost, yet the interior stakes remain more asserted than dramatized. The inkwell-as-relic is a strong characterizing prop, but its agency is ornamental until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s indexing compulsion is embodied in tactile micro-choices—aligning brass gears, noting ink hue shifts—yet her interior contradiction (rational method vs sacrificial myth) stays summary. The final stamp onto the slab crystallizes her values, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid—grief felt in “luminous torment”—yet emotion drifts into abstract waves rather than character-particular contradiction. “Motivation is simple yet terrible” is declared, not dramatized. His final beat of ascending/ descending is visually crisp and embodied, but no micro-choice other than lifting gaze shows the cost. Relationships are absent, so status crucible not invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Survivor’s grief, fusion-seeking resolve, and perceptual signature all consistent; thrusting hand into fissure entails visible, high-cost choice that crystallizes Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “perpetually surprised” stance is embodied in micro-reactions and the final vow to guard the chip. The pilgrim’s murmured verses supply relational pressure, but his interior remains opaque. Motivation is clear and escalates to the decisive lever-pull, yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“guilt-ridden,” “gnaws at the conscience”), but the decisive shift to honesty is asserted more than dramatized; the watch-hand placement feels symbolic rather than a micro-choice that visibly costs him a client or reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The negotiator’s guilt–driven memory of a “failed exchange that had cost dozens” is a guts-level anchor; present choices (untethering the rope, offering the box) directly metabolise that regret into action, an earned reckoning. Interior contradiction surfaces only as pensive delay, never riveting; still, the costly micro-choice—the rope released into mist—concretises the softening of the furrowed hush. Flaws are legible only in after-image, not in dialogue, but silence itself reads as temperament. The final act is an unambiguous renunciation of old chains that lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“merrily melancholic” paradox, “flickering faith”), but the navigator’s contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene; the final alignment feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled for. Backstory is well-anchored to present choices via the compass wobble and pole-shadow navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“skin still tingling,” “dirty ledger of betrayals”), but the shift from self-loathing to empathy is asserted more than dramatized; the mirror’s whisper lands as epiphany rather than earned contradiction. Micro-choices (tossing the ball, choosing the left tunnel) are present yet feel guided by external cues rather than internal hierarchy of values. Cost is gestured at (“weight of its sorrow”) but not made visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s yearning for Arion is palpable and embodied; the bark-patterned skin and shared breath crystallize the cost. Interiority is specific, but the “reluctant” aspect of the metamorphosis is asserted more than dramatized—no moment shows her actively resisting before surrender. Still, the final fusion reads as earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cartomancer’s grief and paradoxical resolve are embodied in tactile micro-choices (unfastening clasp, cradling dew), but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation feels willed rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nara’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal of force and her micro-choice to whisper the vow; the crystal’s use as a “needle of light” links motive to action. Interiority stays concrete—“weight of those sorrows as cold pressure on her back”—but the final step through the gate feels slightly under-motivated; we do not see the moment she commits to leaving the ship forever. The earned cost is implied rather than dramatized on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motivation to “understand the texture of transformation” is stated but never embodied in a concrete, contradictory choice; her passivity lets prophecy and coincidence do the work. The fisherman appears too late to pressure her into a crucible decision, so the relationship remains ornamental. Interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s calmly inventive trait is shown through micro-choices (tracing sundial, placing quill) but interiority is abstract; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The revolution motive is stated early yet never clashes with fear or doubt, so the final renunciation feels lightly earned rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selene’s precognitive curse and her desire to understand sacred patterns create a clear, embodied interior conflict; the shift from fearing the curse to using it as a compass is earned through the ritual and its cost. Micro-choices—placing each rock, kneeling, whispering—reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final smile and measured steps show a credible, costly renunciation of paralysis. Only the “eel herder” label remains ornamental; no eels or herding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid—his “furiously tranquil” stance is embodied in the ritual of setting the timer and placing the envelope—but the arc is more emblematic than causal; the final insight feels bestowed rather than wrested from contradictory impulses. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Philosopher’s mechanical arm is vividly tactile, but interiority stays abstract; diplomat’s “diplomatically fierce” remains label. Their final bow is graceful yet unmotivated by prior micro-choices, so the earned cost feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s molting trait is asserted but never dramatized in a single beat; her choices feel generic “poet” rather than personality-specific. Rook’s scholar-calm is sketched but never tested under pressure. The final whispered line is earned but the interior contradiction that should precede it is missing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the pianist’s “steely longing” is stated more than embodied. Micro-choices (splicing reels, lifting the clock) are present yet feel symbolic rather than driven by contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—bowing only to his own echo—earns a resonant stasis, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “empirically whimsical” mind shows in how she catalogs dreams like weather charts—but the final beat (“luminous doubt…balance she vowed to keep”) is slightly abstract, muting the embodied cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tutor's interiority remains lyrical and poetic—almost ambient—but he makes decisive micro-choices (laying the compass on the stone, the successive knot-tying incantations) that show a shift from passive remembrance to active diffusion, a renunciation that costs him “cerulean regret”. Desire (“find the color of unspoken apologies”) stays abstract and never fully clashes with inner flaw; the contradiction feels gentle, not urgent, blunting the edge that 9+ requires.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority relies on abstract labels ("weight of memories") over embodied contradiction; "feeling the weight settle into her hands" lacks concrete sensory trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction ("trembling certainty") and embodied fear ("heart pounded louder than explosions") drive choices, but "the betrayal of the self I had hidden" slips into diagnostic label-speak during peak pressure, undermining authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation to "unravel the code" is clear and embodied through Mara's tracing of water patterns, but internal conflict lacks layered contradiction beyond reverence—no competing impulses like fear of failure versus obsession weaken the 9+ gate. Final chord press earns closure, yet cost remains abstract (ghost's departure) without visceral character-specific sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)

    Marlowe's interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "circuitously sincere" is stated not tested through meaningful choices. Closure choice (stepping back) feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

Cost feels aesthetic rather than visceral, failing the 9+ test for earned causality with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but interior conflict superficial. "Quietly driven" trait shown through action yet no visible trade-offs or degradation under stress. Final choice lacks felt cost beyond resolve, missing Q1 9+ test requirement.

    Arlen's "emotionally rational" interiority avoids stock phrasing through concrete contradictions: his scholarly detachment wars with tactile reverence for the letter's "heat of its secret," culminating in earned micro-choices like placing it on the rubble pedestal. No diagnostic label-speak mars the climax where he acknowledges "compassion could coexist with stark fact." Single-POV constraints limit relationship dynamics, but embodied conflict suffices for scope.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction shown through embodied tension (calm face vs hammering heart during note placement), but motivation lacks deeper conflict beyond abstract "rebellion against oblivion." "Stoically sensitive" trait informs actions yet remains conceptually thin without tangible stakes beyond preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior consistency but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure; Mara’s logical precision dominates without visceral struggle against the waterlogged environment’s physical toll. Her micro-choices (scanner readjustment) reveal values but omit credible fatigue or doubt during critical hypothesis shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interior contradiction absent; grief portrayed as singular force without competing impulses. Micro-choices (polishing gems) lack value hierarchy—no visible trade-offs during ritual. "Raw grief into luminous threads" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty in peak beats. Strength: embodied sorrow in "luminous torment fills the air" avoids abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in "dread and exhilaration" at the fissure, with grief-as-fuel embodied through "breath that tasted of rust." Lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle; grief’s persistence isn’t tested beyond the single action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "perpetually surprised" trait is stated but doesn't drive micro-choices under pressure. Final endurance feels earned yet motivation remains abstract without tangible cost scaling to length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction vividly embodied ("gnaws at the conscience I try desperately to quiet"), micro-choices like aligning driftwood fragments reveal value hierarchy, but "tempered regret" edges toward abstract label-speak in peak beats, slightly undercutting emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied tension—'weighing each phrase as if air might betray his doubts'—but 'recycled mistakes into wisdom' veers toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining emotional authenticity in the reflection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction ("buoyed by hope yet weighed down") and embodied emotion shine, but "doubts melt into vapor" risks unearned resolution; final choice earned by micro-choices like using utility poles as beacons.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction strong (dirty past vs empathy quest), but mirror acceptance lacks struggle; final choice feels unearned as micro-choices don't reveal value hierarchy during pivotal toss.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority remains abstract ("yearning," "tremor of change") without contradictory impulses in action; "reluctant metamorphosis" told not shown through micro-choices under pressure. No visible tradeoffs for "paradoxically steady" trait beyond label repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction ("willingly perplexed by the paradox") and embodied grief ("thumb to unfasten the silver clasp") shine, but "diagnostic label-speak" in "willingly perplexed" triggers -0.4 deduction despite strong micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pacifist vow drives climax ("no force, only compassion"), but "hidden grief that bound the veil" uses diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, triggering -0.5 penalty. Contradictory joy/sorrow embodiment remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority lacks embodied conflict; Mara’s "exhaustion" from charity work remains abstract despite volcanic setting pressure. No visible struggle with destitution contradicts "meager supplies" label, weakening motivation for detour. Final choice feels unearned as prophecy alignment occurs via convenient fisherman.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's motivation ("spark silent revolution") is clear but under-dramatized; interiority stays abstract ("curiosity turned into quiet intrigue") with no contradictory impulses or visible cost in his final action. Trait consistency lacks struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation to understand patterns is clear but interior contradiction lacks embodied struggle; precognitive curse stated without visible cost during ritual execution. Final shift to "compass" feels unearned as no micro-choices demonstrate the transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority leans abstract ("invisible cartography of scars") without visceral contradictory impulses; micro-choices (timer setting, whispering poem) lack escalation of stakes or visible cost. Final endurance lacks felt consequence despite poetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characters function as thematic vessels without contradictory impulses; the diplomat's sudden bow lacks earned struggle. "Diplomatically fierce" remains label-only without visible cost tradeoffs. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s “molted personalities” concept lacks embodied contradiction; shedding personas reads as label (“calm of a monk and fire of a child”) not visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.3)
    Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "steely longing" is stated but not shown through micro-choices under pressure. Final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality beyond thematic yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction ("luminous doubt" as catalyst) and embodied emotion ("air tasted of citrus and rain") feel authentic, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the pivotal translation sequence where stress would fracture thought.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    No contradictory impulses; motivation lacks internal friction. The tutor's calm execution of ritual shows no struggle against his own flaws under pressure, reducing emotional complexity to serene certainty.
