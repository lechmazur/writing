    Elya's core motivation is established (rebuilding through retracing patterns), but her agency reads as passive observation rather than choice-driven action. The "steadily adaptive" trait and emotional states are asserted through abstract labels ("trembling," "steady," "purpose") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Interior life remains generic and lacks the particularized perception or micro-choices that would elevate characterization; the final "smile" and discovery of purpose feel unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her survivor identity is established early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("silence that settled in her chest like a heavy tide") rather than embodied contradiction. The device-building demonstrates competence, yet the final "smile" and seamless emotional resolution feel too smooth—no genuine blind spot or mistake complicates her arc. The closing weeks-later summary tells rather than dramatizes the pilgrimage effect, losing the micro-choices that would prove endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marlow's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("carrier of silence," "weight of centuries") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His stubbornness is asserted but never dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost; he places lens fragments without facing a dilemma that would foreclose an option. The ending merges him with the lantern's gleam in a lyric dissolve, but no prior causal chain earns this transformation as a character arc with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation to lead and protect the community is clear, but her agency never faces a meaningful internal contradiction or cost. She observes, organizes, and reflects extensively, yet no on-page choice forces her to forfeit a path or wrestle with competing impulses. The elders and children remain functional background figures; Mara's interiority consists largely of declarative statements ("She understood that the sanctions were a test") without embodied contradiction or felt stakes. No credible change or renunciation occurs—only a static maintenance of the same stance from dawn to midnight.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Milo's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Internal life consists largely of abstract spiritual observations ("why the stars sang," "grief could taste like iron") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sequence—place lens, breathe slowly, see map, whisper question—reads as a smooth ritual rather than struggle with visible cost. Embodied emotion is largely absent; actions align with stated motives but without the friction or blind spots that would make the transformation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation ("retrocognitively trapped, recalling futures as if they were already past") is label-only; the story never dramatizes this attribute in a choice or perception that affects tactics. Her interior consists of abstract declarations ("She believed…," "Mara understood…") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment—thanking the garden—reads as a declarative epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The child appears briefly without applying pressure to Mara's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and scaled appropriately, but her interior life remains thin—she recalls a lullaby and whispers a promise, yet these moments feel more like symbolic gestures than embodied contradiction. The "chained liberator" label does little work; the chains rust loose at the end without prior cost or struggle tied to them. Agency is present in the piano-bench puzzle and seed retrieval, but the beats lack genuine friction or mistakes that would reveal character limits under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation to "collect absences" and "find the sound of trust breaking" is declared but never tested by on-page pressure or contradiction. Her interior remains abstract—"feeling the weight of memories settle into her hands"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The piece tells us she "understood" and "felt" repeatedly, but no moment forces her to choose between competing goods or accept visible cost. The final "smile" arrives without earned transformation or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lira remains flat throughout—her "quietly savvy" trait is label-only, never dramatized through contradictory impulses or cost-laden micro-choices. No internal conflict appears; she moves like liquid dusk through the piece without hesitation, doubt, or genuine struggle. The conductor and other figures are props, applying zero interpersonal pressure. The ending grants her a thief-turned-guardian epiphany without earning it through prior causality or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interiority is abstract and externally performed rather than embodied; she narrates tasks "as if these were epic verses" but no contradictory impulses act in scene. The motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" remains told and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. Emotional states are labeled ("weighty lightness," "thawing heart") without visceral contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final whisper to the empty room substitutes declaration for earned renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's phobias are declared but never embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies on abstraction ("trembling certainty," "transformative betrayal") rather than specific contradiction acting simultaneously. The ending gesture—stepping onto the lever—arrives as assertion without on-page struggle or visible cost foreclosing a path. Motivation remains label-only throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The oracle is assigned a clear pursuit—mapping endless night—but agency remains passive observation throughout. Interior life consists of abstract beliefs ("silence held the geometry of night") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final dissolution of the map reads as atmospheric rather than a foreclosure with felt cost; no visible trade-off or renunciation lands on the page. Label-only obsession and stock "ambered hush" phrasing replace character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    The robot's interior reads as philosophical abstraction rather than moment-to-moment processing under pressure. Motivation ("to find where thoughts come from") is declared and pursued through a series of actions, but interiority consists of conceptual summary rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices with visible cost. The "remarkably composed" attribute appears as label-only descriptor without constraining or enabling specific choices. The ending gesture of sweeping ice with "quiet awe" feels like an assertion of change rather than an earned renunciation or stance crystallization, because no prior scene action forced the robot to forfeit or endure a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is introduced with poetic description but no interiority or embodied emotion. Her actions follow a mechanical sequence—finds tickets, uses lens, projects images—without internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a single micro-choice under pressure. The ending claims she "felt a rare peace" but this state is asserted, not dramatized through embodied perception or a renunciation that forecloses a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the protagonist passively facilitates revelation without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    The vine dresser remains largely opaque; his motivation is told ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists almost entirely of abstract assertions ("he felt the paradox of blooming withering settle in his bones") rather than embodied perception. The final "acknowledgment" arrives as gift rather than earned cost, and no on-page sacrifice forecloses a path. Agency is passive throughout—he polishes, listens, and receives rather than choosing between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation ("to prove that time moves sideways") is declared but never tested by on-page pressure or competing desires. Her "obliging nature" appears only as a label in the final paragraph without shaping choices. Interiority consists largely of abstract observations ("the universe's mechanics could be coaxed") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The experiment succeeds without visible cost, failure risk, or internal conflict—she simply executes a procedure and records data.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivations are signaled (unravel the ghost's code, free the trapped melody) but her interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("feeling the pressure of that invisible dialogue," "understanding blossomed"). The final act of placing the program back feels symbolic rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from curiosity to reverence without competing impulses or credible struggle. No embodied emotion or micro-choices under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mirela's interiority is heavily abstract ("swallowed truth," "weight of truth") without concrete embodiment of the contradiction or struggle. The fever-recovery frame provides a state change, but her micro-choices (spreading paper, adjusting barometer) feel procedural rather than driven by competing impulses. The ending suggests a shift from inward to outward carrying of truth, but the cost is asserted ("heavy yet surprisingly light") rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. Backstory (the swallowed lie ceremony) anchors in the present stimulus but does not create friction that alters her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains more concept than character; decisions are observational rather than truly pressured. Interior life is buried under figurative density—"drowsy alertness" recurs as a label without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to leave the wheel reads as thematic gesture rather than a motivated turn foreclosing a path with visible cost, and no prior behavior established what Mara wanted enough to sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper's motivation ("to witness change without judgment") is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. "Grips reality loosely" remains a lyric label without visible cost or tactical consequence. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace") instead of embodied contradiction. The final descent lacks a forfeited path or felt internal conflict that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora remains observant rather than conflicted; her purpose "to nurture lifelong wonder" is stated but never tested by competing goods or visible cost. The piece tells us she feels "cautious exuberance" but offers no embodied contradiction—no moment where her professional responsibility collides with personal doubt or forces a trade-off. The eclipse session proceeds frictionlessly, and her final whispered promise reads as affirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The historian's motivation is presented through label-only interiority ("sensitively perceptive," "believing," "reasoning") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. His movements remain essentially observation—lifting, pressing, recording—with no decision that forecloses a path or costs him anything visible. The final moment ("feeling that the stories walls have heard are finally being gathered") offers summary satisfaction rather than a choice under pressure. No micro-choices alter present options; the character drifts through a preordained discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains externally observed throughout, defined by decorative occupation ("cryptic fortune cookie writer") rather than contradictory interior impulses acting in scene. His motivation arrives as abstract declaration ("to transpose life into a new key") without embodied struggle or micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. The visitor's response is told ("felt a rush of knowledge") rather than dramatized through action that forecloses a path. No visible cost constrains the final choice; the ending simply asserts transformation without prior causality earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.2)
    The loop pedal priest remains a conceptual figure rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior life is replaced by abstract descriptions ("believed," "sensed," "knew") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final bow and walk into light read as symbolic gestures rather than choices earned by prior causality with visible cost. Agency is asserted through rhetorical framing rather than dramatized through conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lian is given vivid interiority through the phosphorescent nautilus and sensory anchors (sand between toes, gulls over glass sea), and her longing is embodied in physical gestures (aligning the shell, sketching on frost). However, her choices remain largely internal and contemplative rather than forcing trade-offs under pressure; the story unfolds as a series of deliberate ritual actions without genuine obstacles or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through causality—no on-page struggle with a competing want or cost forecloses a path. Diagnostic label ("chronologically homesick") is given weight through imagery but never constrains a micro-choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist remains an abstract cipher throughout; no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. "Conquering the labyrinth of self" is told in therapy-speak labels rather than dramatized struggle. The final "peace" is unearned—no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal voice is stable but generic, lacking character-particular perception or stakes that compel higher-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marin's motivation to defeat numbness is declared but her interior contradictions are thin—she observes effects but makes few live choices under competing impulses. The turn from setting the needle to rewinding songs shows agency, yet the entire arc feels narrated from outside; we see the frost melt rather than experiencing her struggle with it. Embodied emotion is sparse: "smiled, a quiet celebration" and "felt the emotional numbness dissolve" label states without concrete sensory particulars. The final choice lacks visible cost; the phonograph functions as a magic key rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("layered tranquility," "credibly curious") that remains label-only rather than embodied. Her decision to drop the tube into the shaft lacks visible internal contradiction or cost; the action reads as a clever solution rather than a choice that forecloses another path. The cat cameo and whispered vow feel ornamental, not pressure-driven. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of competing values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.2)
    The poet remains abstract and unchanging throughout—"passionate subtlety," "ethically playful grin" are labels never dramatized through contradiction or embodied choice. No internal conflict appears; he moves through dilemmas (free fireflies vs. trade rope) without visible struggle or cost that would reveal character. The final binding of the rope reads as declaration rather than earned renunciation, because no prior beat established what he would forfeit by choosing one path over another. Interiority consists of stock poeticism ("texture of time") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.2)
    The violinist remains a vessel for atmospheric display rather than a protagonist with contradictory impulses acting under pressure. Her motivation "to find beauty in the unfinished" is asserted through narration ("seeking beauty in the unfinished world") but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. The interior life consists of poetic observation ("felt the chronic hush lift") without embodied emotion or micro-decisions that foreclose a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance emerges; she walks away serene, unchanged by any friction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation as a counterfeit emotion dealer is declared rather than dramatized through on-page choices that test her commitment. The "affectionate detachment" reads as a label without embodied contradiction—she performs her trade smoothly without internal conflict or a moment where genuine feeling threatens her professional stance. Interiority relies on abstract formulations ("half truths of the grotto—half memory, half myth—begin to coalesce") rather than specific embodied sensation. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges; the ending finds her planning the next harvest with unchanged options.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is defined by a string of labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") that never translate into contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to deliver the locket feels teleological rather than earned by pressure—no visible cost, no foreclosed path. The lighthouse keeper appears as a one-beat prop with no interiority or resistance. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("felt a cautious exuberance surge") rather than embodied sensation, and the final ceremony resolve threads mechanically without Mara facing any genuine tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arlen's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "boldly sympathetic" trait appears as a label without forcing a visible tradeoff; no moment shows her feeling forced to choose between sympathy and self-protection. Villagers remain a collective with no individual pressure or status dynamics. The final choice to dedicate the arbor feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle, and no path is foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's interior reads as abstract and externalized throughout; her "motivation was singular" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The piece offers no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values—she glides through a lyric reverie without friction or doubt. Embodiment is absent: no bodily reaction to the glowing pendant, no hesitation before stepping onto light, no cost that alters her stance. The final dissolution of the pendant and her walk back lack any visible forfeit or renunciation that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.2)
    The conjurer remains abstract throughout—his "purpose was gently inventive" and "delicate dance between curiosity and compassion" are asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visceral struggle. No genuine internal contradiction appears; he moves through the orchard unopposed by doubt, fear, or competing desire. The "ambiguous loss that lingered like a half-remembered song" is told as background flavor rather than a live wound that forces difficult micro-choices. Therapy-speak intrudes ("mathematics of emotion," "buried optimism blooming") without embodied cost or physical manifestation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren's "kindly methodical nature" is stated but rarely constrains choice; her actions proceed without visible internal conflict or trade-offs. The caching and tape-recovery unfold as smooth execution rather than decisions under pressure. The final visibility moment reads as thematic declaration rather than earned change with foreclosed options. Interiority remains abstract—"collective yearning," "quiet grief"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marlowe's motivation to study plant behavior is stated but never conflicts with a competing desire or resource constraint; he observes without making a difficult choice. The "circuitously sincere" attribute is mentioned twice as a label without dramatizing a tradeoff it enables or blocks. Interior voice leans toward elevated nature-essay register ("apologetic unfurling of chlorophyll") that reads more like lyric summary than embodied thought under pressure. The leaf's transformation is witnessed rather than earned through Marlowe's agency risking something concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is stated but her choices feel more like following a pre-ordained path than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The "exchange" decision arrives without visible internal conflict—she simply places the brooch and experiences the convergence. The interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("thresh meaning from experience," "haggard awe") rather than embodied particulars. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path appears; the ending grants her both art and renewal without felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira is introduced as "a clairvoyant who didn't see it coming" but never makes a meaningful choice under pressure; she watches, whispers promises, and feels things without agency. The pilgrim remains a cipher defined only by wool and a prayer. Internal contradiction is absent; emotions are labeled ("feels the unseen forces settle") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses. The story withholds interiority and offers no micro-choices that reveal values under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's interior world is filtered through poetic abstractions rather than embodied emotion under pressure. His "reactively visionary" nature is labeled but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The exile's end and his solitary purpose are told rather than tested; when he sets out at the end, no visible cost or forfeiture is legible—he simply continues his mission without friction. The few gestures present (lifting the valve, blowing notes) remain externalized choreography rather than windows into contradictory wants or flawed reasoning.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    The route mapper remains a label throughout, defined by her occupation and mission statement rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "daring" is declared in opening exposition but never tested by a visible cost that forecloses a path; she moves through the vault without friction, hesitation, or trade-off. The final "promise to return" is told rather than dramatized, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("trembling certainty," "awe") without embodied sensation or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira is established as a "sympathetic skeptic" with the trait "courageously kind," but these labels remain largely ornamental. Her interiority consists of abstract wonder and a disciplined note-taking stance; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure appears. The climactic beat—realizing the tile is a conduit—lands as epiphany-by-assertion rather than earned through conflicting impulses. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply closes her notebook feeling "rare peace."

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    The immortal's boredom is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains abstract ("eyes heavy with centuries of ennui," "quiet awe") without character-particular texture or visible struggle. The final "goodbye to his former emptiness" reads as label-only transformation rather than earned change through prior causality. The twin encounter offers potential for internal conflict but dissolves into exposition rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation is established through backstory but her interior life remains abstract—emotions are declared ("fluid resolve," "rigid doubts") rather than embodied. The pivotal choice to use the ink pot feels telegraphed from the start with no genuine internal conflict or trade-off dramatized on the page. The father's legacy is told rather than shown influencing a live decision, and the asylum officials exist only as off-stage pressure with no relational friction. Agency is present but the psychological cost of transforming her father's con into honesty is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stationer remains almost entirely opaque: we see ornate description of his movements but no contradiction, genuine struggle, or embodied emotion. His motivation is told ("to collect the textures of different times") but never tested; no choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. The piece reads as extended portraiture rather than a character under pressure making difficult decisions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains a void rather than a contradictory individual—motivations are declared ("driven by a need to discover the texture of memories") but never tested through on-page choice that forecloses a path. No genuine internal conflict arises; the narrator drifts through containers collecting stories without struggle, cost, or embodied emotion beyond vague "tingles." The final stance—becoming "the unnamed keeper"—is asserted without prior causality or visible sacrifice, reading as label-only epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dr. Selene Voss is defined by her profession ("myth buster") but never demonstrates internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "gloomy cheerfulness" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "smile tug at her lips" and light step at the end lack causal grounding in any on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("stubborn optimism," "relentless pursuit of truth") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira remains a label construct throughout—"culture shock absorber" with an "orderly intuitive mind" never translates into embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Her dual allegiance is declared but never dramatized as competing impulses in a single beat; we're told she feels torn but see only smooth execution. The council, investors, dock workers, illustrators, elders, and children populate the margins without applying relational pressure or forcing visible trade-offs. Internal life is summarized ("her chest expanding with hopeful desperation") rather than enacted through sensory degradation or contradictory wants colliding on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inspector remains an archetype defined by stated traits ("purposefully curious") rather than embodied contradictions. Interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("elegy," "melancholy of dawn") without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The grief and solace at the grain's capture are asserted rather than dramatized through hesitation or trade-off. No secondary character appears to test the POV through relationship friction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's blindness is mentioned but rarely constrains choices with visible cost; the repair proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or competing impulses. Her whispered "Feel the lift" and thanking the mist read as performative rather than embodied under pressure. The colleague's entrance at the end is inert, adding headcount without pressure. Interior life remains surface-level; no contradictory wants act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and drives the action toward mapping the rivers' origin, but her "dry-witted" and "subtly confident" traits remain label-only without behavioral embodiment. The final choice to step outside and record coordinates is dramatized, but the interior progression feels declarative rather than contradictory—she moves from tranquility to hope without visible internal friction. The phrasebook functions as a prop rather than a relationship crucible, and no secondary character applies on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    The bell tuner remains a static archetype without embodied interiority or contradictory impulses. No on-page micro-choices under pressure appear; he glides through the narrative performing symbolic gestures ("placed the ebony fork," "whispered to the stones") that are recounted rather than experienced from within. Motivation is declared ("restore shared balance") but never tested by competing wants or visible cost. Workers arrive as scenery, and the tuner's "patient patience" is label-only, never dramatized through a moment of temptation or doubt that might reveal character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation arrives late (mid-story realization about "harnessing the ephemeral") and feels declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The choice to let the beacon fade reads unmotivated—no prior interiority establishes why she would trust "the temple's judgment" or what cost that surrender carries personally. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("unsnarl the tight coil of panic," "calm resolve") rather than embodied sensation. The final choice lacks visible cost; she rises with the vial intact, releases it ceremonially, then returns repeatedly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The boy remains an abstract symbol rather than a felt character. Interiority consists of poetic gestures ("chasing hush," "heart beat steady with purpose") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The mother's vanishing and the lattice are told as backstory labels; no on-page action dramatizes internal conflict or a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "peace" is declared, not earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ghost bride remains entirely abstract—no micro-choices under pressure, no embodied contradiction, no genuine interiority. Her "lovingly venomous" affection and debt repayment are asserted through poetic summary rather than dramatized through action or decision. The final "sigh that tasted of roses and rust" is a metaphoric gesture without visible cost or consequence to her agency. No relationship crucible exists; she drifts through a static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    The weaver remains an abstract vessel for the concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "purpose" is declared ("to carve a path from ruin to reverence") but never tested by competing desires or genuine obstacles that force difficult trade-offs. The piece summarizes her nightly ritual and its outcomes without dramatizing a single moment where her flaws, limits, or fears create friction. "Hauntingly optimistic" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choice or produces visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to restore faith is signaled early, but her interior remains gestural—"warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The work spans days yet no fatigue, doubt, or competing impulse interrupts the reverent flow; she kneels, turns, gathers, and smiles without visible cost or friction. The final gratitude from the bones and her promise feel awarded rather than earned by prior struggle. Interiority leans on atmospheric labels instead of character-particular perception degrading under the weight of excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains abstract throughout—her "carefully inventive narratives" and clipboard rituals are described but never dramatized through genuine choice under pressure. The piece tells us she "required a ritual" and "realized" things without showing contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The final "quiet assurance" is asserted rather than earned through on-page cost. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply completes a ceremony that faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    The galaxy-chart embroiderer remains a label rather than a character with embodied choices. Her "disguises wisdom as foolishness" trait is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost. The synchronization with the candle flame is described in summary ("she taught herself") rather than shown as a live decision under pressure. No on-page micro-choice forces her to navigate competing desires or forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cryptic medium remains an abstraction throughout—motivations are declared ("fierce tenderness," "unsent letters") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on stock metaphors ("heavy as any physical weight") and therapeutic phrasing ("the space where an apology waits unspoken") that flatten rather than particularize her stance. The final "understanding" arrives as assertion without visible cost: she smiles and tucks away the shard, feeling dissolution rather than wrestling with the paradox her title promises. Agency reads passive; spirits and moonlight do the work while she observes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    The translator's motivation ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") is declared but never tested by an on-page choice with cost. Her "shrewdly innocent" trait appears only as a label in the opening. The child remains a passive prop under anesthetic throughout; no interaction forces a decision. Interiority consists of abstract metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    The mural artist is presented through assertion rather than embodied choice under pressure. Her motivation "to rediscover lost joy" is declared but never tested by an on-page conflict that forces her to weigh competing goods or pay a visible cost. Interiority relies on label-only phrasing ("her heart alight," "pensive mirth") and therapy-speak ("rediscovered joy") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lena's motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions—placing the coin, whispering, tapping her brush—lack embodied resistance or cost; she moves smoothly through a sequence of gestures without genuine internal conflict. The "nested awakening within each brushstroke she had ever painted" reads as abstract epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. No visible cost accompanies her final smile and decision to walk away; the piece tells us she chose curiosity over comfort without dramatizing what was forsaken.

Dr. Mirabel's pivot from scientist to protector arrives without prior contradiction or earned causality.

    The poet remains an abstraction—"shyly unstoppable," "singular mission"—with no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority consists of declarative mission statements ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The centuries-long timeframe dissolves any moment-to-moment stake, and no meaningful change or renunciation occurs with visible cost; the ending merely completes a pre-ordained process. The character reads as a symbolic vessel, not an individual with flaws that drive mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.2)
    The caretaker remains abstract—a function rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Her "foxglove regret" is named but never dramatized as conflicting impulses forcing a choice; she simply repeats ritual without visible internal friction. The traveler appears as narrative furniture to receive a glass orchid, not to complicate or test her stance. No micro-choices alter tactics under pressure; the ending gesture (refilling the candle, whispering a name) loops the opening without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara remains a fixed abstraction; her "carefully reckless" trait is stated but never tested through a concrete choice where caution and recklessness pull her in opposite directions. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("cautious exuberance of a child discovering a secret garden") rather than embodied perception. The shadow-scholars who emerge at the end feel like convenient props rather than pressure points, and no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)

The meteorite chip and pigeons function as symbolic props rather than tools that force trade-offs or reveal character limits. Interiority relies on abstract poetic constructions ("the attic seemed to bloom with a withering grace") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    The child's motivation to find the exit and discover sacred thresholds is asserted but never tested through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Interiority consists largely of poetic abstraction ("featherly determined resolve," "necessary distances") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular thought. The final decision to "share its fractured hush with the world" and become "a keeper of its quiet rituals" feels declared rather than earned through visible cost or struggle. No meaningful change forecloses a path; the child simply accepts a role without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria remains a cipher throughout—her profession as "landscape astrologer" is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure. The piece traffics in label-only emotions ("the pull of belonging," "the rhythm of belonging") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that would reveal hierarchy of values. The ending declares she has learned something but we never witness internal conflict, foreclosed options, or visible cost; she emerges with the feather "clutched to her chest" in a gesture that performs emotion rather than earning it. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs on the page with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maren's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract labels ("cheerful gloom," "bittersweet note," "hopeful sorrow") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her quest proceeds through a sequence of mechanical seed-presses with no visible internal conflict, doubt, or cost that would foreclose a path.

No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure; she moves through the cave as if on rails.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    The performer remains a conduit for orchestrated ideas rather than a person under pressure. Interior life consists of aesthetic declarations ("magic could happen by ordering randomness") without embodied contradiction or cost. Micro-choices—rearranging bishops, pouring ink, playing violin—read as choreographed demonstration rather than decisions that narrow options or reveal hierarchy of values. The "satisfaction of a mind that had turned a simple bishop into a beacon" is asserted pleasure, not earned through dramatized struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira remains a conceptual figure throughout, defined by poetic labels ("tide dancer," "elective exile") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her "ambition" is declared but never contested on the page—no competing desire, no moment of doubt that would reveal internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maren's interiority is presented entirely through abstract declarations ("gently skilled at stitching wounds with silence," "hard softness") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "bargain of innocence" remains a backstory label never tested by present choice; her walk to the village and box-opening proceed without genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotions are performed through poetic assertion ("felt the hard softness settle into her bones") rather than embodied through specific sensation or micro-choice under pressure. The hikers' gratitude and villagers' reception are told as outcomes, denying any dramatized stake or renunciation that would earn characterization credit.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arin remains abstract throughout—"logical dreamer" and "lucidly watchful" are asserted labels never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The council and artisans function as chorus rather than individuated presences; no relationship friction exists.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to map wall dreams is clear but remains abstract; her interiority relies heavily on poetic metaphor ("echo cartographer," "legacy's burden") without grounding in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The film-negative moment offers sensory specificity, yet her sensory perceptions and decisions feel interchangeable with any sensitive archivist. The final acceptance of the "legacy's burden" as "shared communion" reads as an epiphany asserted rather than earned through visible cost or internal conflict.

    Lira's role as negotiator is established, but her interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("quiet ache," "fragile hope") and label-only emotions rather than embodied contradiction. The chieftains' transformation from armor-clanging warriors to sword-laying peacemakers happens too smoothly without on-page resistance or credible internal conflict. Micro-choices are present (placing the clipboard, writing terms) but lack the contradictory impulses or visible cost that would elevate characterization into the high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philanthropist is a label more than a living character; his "amoral grace" and "secretly sentimental yearning" are asserted through narration rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

No on-page micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values—he executes a plan without friction or cost to his own stance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    The courtesan remains abstract—a "paradox of purity and allure" whose choices never emerge from internal contradiction or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Selene is defined primarily through abstract labels ("urbane calligrapher," "uncommonly serene") rather than embodied action under pressure. The reflective mode dominates—her memories of puppet shows, the tavern argument, and ethical storytelling philosophies—but no concrete choice or renunciation occurs on the page with visible cost. The final "promise" and rehearsed reversals are told intentions, not dramatized decisions that foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira remains an abstraction—"esoteric realist" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice under pressure.

No micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. The final "guardian" pose summarizes rather than earns transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is coherent, but her interior life consists mostly of poetic abstraction ("thawing fire," "snowmelt ardor") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Foresight Hindsight Only is established through conceptual label rather than embodied contradiction; her "paradox of seeing both what has been and what will be, yet never the present moment" remains an assertion without dramatized cost or micro-choices that show the disability in action.

The final "transcendence" reads as convenient epiphany—she whispers gratitude and the vortex rewards her—without prior struggle or renunciation that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Nabu's interior remains abstract: "curiosity glowed like distant fire" and "his frugality forced him to measure" are labels without embodied contradiction.

The piece tells us he is frugal and curious but never dramatizes a micro-choice where those traits collide under pressure. Emotional progression is summarized rather than shown through contradictory embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)

Motivation remains abstract ("gentle twist of hidden gears") with no visible cost or genuine struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "chimera twin discoverer" remains an abstract cipher—"stitched feathers and rusted brass"—without embodied motivation or internal contradiction. Actions (pirouetting, diving into ink, gathering blossoms) read as outline gestures rather than pressure-tested choices with visible cost.

No micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values; the ending grants satisfaction without renunciation or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation ("translate confusion into clarity") remains declarative rather than contradictory; her actions follow a methodical path without meaningful internal conflict or trade-offs visible on the page. The archival expertise appears convenient—she catalogues, descends, reweaves—yet we never see her doubt, struggle with physical limits, or pay a visible personal cost for the capability. Embodied emotion is scarce; labels like "warmly methodical" and "content" substitute for somatic response under pressure. The final smile and readiness feel unearned by any preceding vulnerability or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains a cipher throughout—defined by abstract labels ("preemptively nostalgic," "to sculpt identity from experience") rather than concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "motivation" is declared repeatedly but never tested by a genuine dilemma that would force a trade-off with visible cost. The prose cycles through thesaurus variants of the same conceptual claim (sculpting identity, collective memory, shared pasts) without dramatizing a single micro-choice under pressure. No embodied emotion or flawed reasoning surfaces; the character exists to articulate the story's thesis rather than live it.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    The designer remains an abstract cipher whose internal contradictions are asserted ("serious playfulness," "fierce resolve") rather than enacted through difficult choice.

Interiority consists of poetic declarations that never degrade under stress or reveal competing motives.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    The chronicler remains a passive observer throughout, with no contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. Her motivation ("to discover the texture of time") is told rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

No visible cost or meaningful renunciation occurs; she exits satisfied, having risked nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation to collect silence-flavors is concrete and his claustrophobic fear embodied early ("his chest were a rubber band nearing its limit"). The arc from fear to expansion reads clearly, and the doll's use shows micro-choices. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the final "understand that a cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky" edges toward therapeutic summary rather than earned embodiment at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation ("to teach silence how to comfort") is stated rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—monitoring noise, whispering counter-tones, adjusting speed—read as competent execution of a fixed method without internal conflict or credible struggle.

    The narrator's past pyramid-scheme experience is declared but never internally contradicts or complicates present choices—it functions as exposition rather than lived constraint. Interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("righteous mischief," "quantum promise felt different") without embodied sensation or micro-hesitation that would reveal character under pressure. The final "covenant" moment reads as thesis statement rather than earned stance shift, and the manager's sudden reappearance from the pyramid days is convenient rather than causally prepared. No visible cost forecloses a path; the diamonds simply arrive and the farm prospers.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lian's motivation is declared but never tested by an internal contradiction or competing impulse. The "dynasty ender" label remains ornamental; no action demonstrates what ending a dynasty means in practice or why he carries that designation.

The final realization about "transforming silence into eloquence" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered in therapy-speak rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The withdrawn knight remains an abstraction throughout, defined by ornamental actions (placing fingers on glyphs, whispering promises) rather than contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority consists of label-only states ("shivering bliss," "murmured allegiance") without character-particular texture or micro-choices that reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.2)
    Amelia remains one-note throughout: "broken-hearted archivist" whose motivation ("magnify small kindnesses") is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The button discovery shifts nothing in her stance—she continues her archival work with the same gentle optimism, never facing a cost or trade-off. Interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("quiet solidarity," "empathy," "heart still broken but steadier") and label-only emotions. No internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; her arc is a smooth upward drift without foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains fundamentally flat—her "quiet smile often masked fierce resolve" is a stock rebel template never complicated by on-page contradiction or genuine flawed decision. Internal conflict is absent; she executes her plan without hesitation, ambivalence, or visible cost to her values or relationships.

The ending offers no character change or renunciation with felt weight—she simply walks away, her resolve untested.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The saxophonist remains an abstraction throughout—his actions are stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The backstory fragment about his father teaching "the language of fog" offers decoration rather than a micro-choice that alters present tactics. Interior experience is largely absent; we never feel him weigh options or register the cost of his act. The ending renunciation ("his eyes reflecting the softly shimmering colors") reads as label-only rather than a forfeiture earned by prior on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira lacks contradictory impulses or genuine internal friction; her dedication to decoding leaf messages proceeds smoothly without any competing desires or doubts. The "transformation" is declared rather than embodied—"her eyes now reflecting the mossy delight of centuries-old bark" is metaphoric assertion, not dramatized change with visible cost. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; she simply follows each clue in sequence. The final gratitude gesture feels unearned because no prior choice foreclosed an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical positioning ("uncertainly certain pull," "befriend uncertainty") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

The final "smile" and comfort with uncertainty read as resolution without earned struggle; no path is foreclosed with visible price. Body and emotion remain mostly labeled rather than enacted in micro-choices that reveal competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist remains largely opaque: her interior is painted in abstract terms ("factually mystical approach," "invisible mass") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us she seeks to understand the weight of names but never dramatizes competing impulses or a hierarchy of values through action. The final restoration feels ordained rather than earned by prior struggle; we see technical success but no visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is asserted ("luminous regret," "quiet gratitude") rather than shown through degraded perception or irrational layering.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.2)
    The translator exists as a label rather than a character making choices under pressure. Interiority is abstract and consistently elevated ("I work as a between‑worlds translator, a conduit") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The supposed "task" to honor the lighthouse memory unfolds through passive observation and metaphysical gestures rather than difficult trade-offs. The final "promise to the unseen sailors" arrives as unearned sentiment disconnected from any on-page cost or character-specific vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's occupation and ghost-sight are present, but her choices trace a largely frictionless investigation with minimal internal conflict. The emotional progression from "weightless burden" to "quiet purpose" is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or visible cost—she gathers artifacts and gratitude without forfeiting anything meaningful. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("skillfully observant eyes," "strange lightness") and the final transformation reads unmotivated by prior psychological pressure. No embodied struggle makes the ending feel necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.2)
    Mara remains label-only throughout: "cryptic letterpress operator" whose motivation ("compress eternity into a moment") is asserted but never rooted in concrete want, fear, or prior wound.

The repair work proceeds without visible struggle, competence never tested by meaningful failure. Interiority consists of generic gestures ("felt the weight of centuries," "heart humming") rather than character-specific perception.

The final "deserted alchemist" label is repeated without exploring what desertedness costs him in the moment of choice. Motivation is declared but never tested by a competing desire or visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Harel's interiority is carried largely through abstract vocabulary ("velvet disquiet," "covenant") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. His micro-choices—lifting the cylinder, whispering in Sumerian—exist on the page but lack contradictory impulses or visible cost that would foreclose a path. The emotional arc from unease to "faint smile" reads as declared rather than dramatized through competing desires. The final sealing feels more like ceremony than a decision with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's interior is entirely label-driven ("furiously tranquil," "quiet hunger") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist performs ceremonial actions but never faces a credible dilemma or internal conflict that would reveal character through decision. Her grandmother's phrase and the vortex inheritance are told backstory that substitutes for present stakes. The ending smile after planting the seed reads as unearned satisfaction without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist remains passive throughout; his "credibly curious nature" and "quiet stewardship" are declared rather than tested by contradictory impulses. The final moment confirms his purpose but offers no visible renunciation or trade-off—he simply succeeds. Interior access is thin: we see procedural thought (counting glue-drying time, noting sensor data) but no embodied fear, doubt, or friction between competing desires that would complicate the installation task.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cosmic janitor remains a cipher throughout: labeled "spiritually curious" and given tasks (tracing star paths, empathizing), yet no contradictory impulse or on-page micro-choice under pressure emerges. The interiority consists entirely of abstract states ("feeling vulnerability turn to a quiet fire") without embodied sensation or a hierarchy of competing wants. The vow to the heavens and the final gratitude are declared rather than earned through dramatized struggle. No meaningful change or credible endurance forecloses a path with visible cost; the janitor begins reverential and ends reverential with no alteration in options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.2)
    The recluse's motivation to preserve the weight of unspoken words is stated but never dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. His gazing and tracing are purely observational acts with no visible cost or internal contradiction. The character remains static throughout, performing contemplative gestures rather than making decisions that foreclose paths. No embodied emotion or micro-choices under competing pressures emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara's motivation ("to understand the texture of time passing") remains abstract and is never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Her interiority consists largely of stock metaphor ("minutes stretching like thin silk") and declarative emotional labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile and satisfaction come without any dramatized internal conflict or renunciation that would earn the shift. The claimed "fulfillment" is asserted rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet exists as a collection of abstract attributes ("warmly attentive heart," "quiet cadence") rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of poetic declarations—"His purpose, to discover beauty in the incomplete"—that read as thematic label-speak rather than embodied thought under pressure. No meaningful choice occurs; he performs a series of ritualized gestures (placing feather, arranging pebbles, whispering verses) without visible cost or internal conflict. The piece tells us he has "spent years collecting fragments" but we never see a present-moment decision that forecloses a path or tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is stated but never genuinely tested by an on-page choice that carries visible cost. Her "brazen calm" remains a label throughout; we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. The ending claims vigor transferred from the orchard without dramatizing struggle or credible endurance. Internal conflict is absent, replaced by serene execution of a plan that meets no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arin remains a label-only "luminous skeptic" without embodied interior contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. His academically rebellious trait is declared rather than shown through costly decisions. The scholars and the tower's "alien mind" are props without agency or relationship pressure. Emotional states like "belonging" and "defiant heart" are asserted through stock phrasing rather than rendered through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The coachman remains an abstract figure throughout—mission whispered by ancestors, trained in ancient syllables—but never makes a choice under pressure that reveals competing impulses or a cost. Interiority is entirely absent; we watch actions from outside with no embodied emotion or contradiction. The final paragraph's "heart as narrow as the jetty yet as vast as the sea he had healed" is label-only epiphany without prior struggle. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost is earned by causality; he completes his task exactly as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    Rook's motivation to "carry these voices across the cracked plains" emerges but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. The transition from body-finder to memory-keeper is declared rather than earned through on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("heart thumped," "purpose rekindle") instead of embodied, character-particular perception. The final choice to reseal the leaf feels unmotivated—no dramatized internal conflict shapes the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains a passive observer throughout; the "blessed pariah" label is ornamental and never constrains a choice. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("confusion melt into a quiet resolve") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final "promise" to navigate by invisible true north is asserted, not earned through a dramatized internal struggle with visible cost. No micro-choices alter present options; the character drifts through visions without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lysander's characterization relies heavily on decoration—"coat of midnight velvet stitched with silver threads," "apprentice of wonder"—rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His interior voice is generic and over-articulated ("cautious abandon of a child daring to touch a storm"), employing therapy-speak and label-only feelings instead of lived tension. The swapping ritual proceeds without visible struggle, doubt, or tactical adjustment; each piece clicks into place as if fulfilling a script rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses. The final "promise to the wind" and market-square display read as tidy moral calibration, bypassing the flawed renunciation or endurance that would foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira's core motivation—to record small gestures erased by history—is established early, but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The "crisis actor who could feign terror and still feel its teeth" promises interesting contradiction but never generates on-page friction or competing impulses; she moves through the gallery without hesitation, ambivalence, or cost. The scroll discovery and walking patterns feel like puzzle-solving rather than choices shaped by flawed perception or genuine struggle. Her final peace arrives without any visible price or renunciation that would foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation is declared early but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her interior reads as lyric abstraction—"vibration thrumming through the marrow of her bones"—rather than embodied, character-particular thought under pressure. The final placement of the stone feels like acceptance without visible cost or foreclosed path; we see no micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Emotional progression is summarized in metaphor rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.2)
    The tutor's journey toward self-forgiveness is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("fierce repose," "woven hush") that function as labels rather than embodied perception. The climactic moment of letting go ("he let go of the pawn that haunted him, watching it dissolve") reads as visualization exercise rather than a choice with visible cost. "Fidgets productively" appears twice but never constrains or complicates a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's core motivation—refracting truth through art—is clear, but her interior remains abstract and label-driven ("defiant spirit," "innocently mischievous") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The townsfolk function as backdrop; no relationship pressure forces trade-offs. The final "calm" resolution feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression flattens into a single arc of collective uplift without struggle or self-deception complicating the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist's uncertainty is declared but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—she moves from doubt to resolve in a clean arc without competing impulses under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("uncertain," "desperate rhythm," "quiet confidence") rather than embodied perception. The final smile and door-closing gesture feel like mechanical closure beats rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests her motives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The nostalgic painter's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("intimate aloofness," "temporary eternity") rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation to "find a place where time could hold a temporary eternity" reads as imposed poetic diction, not a grounded want with visible stakes. The final gathering of glowing shells feels unearned—no prior struggle or cost makes this reward legible. Micro-choices exist (lifting the shell, unlocking the chest) but they unfold without friction or competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is stated early but her agency remains observational rather than consequential—she places objects, whispers promises, and watches outcomes arrive via the fisherman's response rather than through her own risk or contradiction. The "screaming tenderness" label and "fierce love that shouted silently" exemplify therapy-speak that abstracts emotion instead of embodying it through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; no competing impulse complicates her intention or forces a visible trade-off. The fisherman's arrival functions as external validation rather than a choice-driven turn, leaving Mara's arc as passive witness to her own premise.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.8)
    The navigator remains an abstract figure throughout—"eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps" is ornamental rather than enacted. No micro-choices under pressure appear; she records coordinates, builds an engine, and watches ships arrive, but we never see her hesitate, choose between competing goods, or pay a visible personal cost. Interiority consists of thematic statements ("she understood that reverse migration was not a folly") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile is asserted ("not with triumph but with the steady acceptance") without dramatized struggle to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's "involuntary truthfulness" is declared but never shown in micro-choices that embody contradiction under pressure. The final confrontation with smugglers ("You cannot hide behind relics") reads as assertion rather than a dramatized embodied dilemma. Internal conflict remains told ("my rational mind could not merely catalog truffles") without simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The renunciation of relic-trafficking lacks visible cost tied to specific personal stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlowe is given a clear motivation and observational method, but his internal experience remains largely external and poetic rather than embodied. The "investigate" arc proceeds without visible friction, contradiction, or cost-driven micro-choices. His final gesture (placing the flower, lighting the lamp) reads as symbolic completion rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. The lone keeper's isolation is declared and ornamented but not tested by competing impulses or genuine struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian remains a placeholder figure whose motivation—keeping a promise to a dying explorer—is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The interior voice defaults to lyrical abstraction ("lingering promise bound his heart," "felt a surge of purpose") without embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to step through the doorway and then return lacks visible cost; the claim that "every future decision would now echo" tells rather than shows forfeiture. No secondary character appears on the page to create relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The queen's motivation to "unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" is stated but never embodied in micro-choices under pressure; she simply follows a linear path to a basin that conveniently reveals everything. Internal conflict is absent—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously. The orb-drinking moment and final vow feel unearned, arriving without prior causality that would make renunciation or acceptance costly. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("bleeding starlight," "lacy menace") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The pocket-sun alchemist remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His friends are undifferentiated and serve as audience rather than sources of conflict. The "directed spontaneity" and emotional beats read as告诉 assertions ("felt a surge," "calm certainty") rather than dramatized through bodily response or hesitation. No visible cost forecloses a path; the experiment succeeds without friction, and the group departs unified.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrator's interiority is dense but largely contemplative rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "jealous of past selves" motivation is asserted repeatedly but never embodied through a micro-choice with visible cost. Emotions lean toward abstract lyric labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than specific embodied states. The final act of stepping outside reads as willful rather than earned by prior pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's interiority leans heavily on abstract labels—"tremor of purpose," "quiet kinship," "reverent fingers"—that assert emotion rather than embody it through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's arc from repairing a screw to feeling "the world breathe anew" lacks a visible internal cost or foreclosed path; she ends where she began, meditative and calm, with no on-page trade-off. The absence of a second character removes any relational crucible, and the piece offers no dramatized mistake or blind spot that compounds before resolution. Motivation remains declarative rather than tested by conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority is present but relies heavily on abstraction ("to transform scars into stories," "pressure of the moment") rather than embodied contradiction. The scars function as symbolic wounds rather than genuine flaws that complicate choices. The tea ceremony sequence shows no micro-choices under pressure—she executes a ritual without conflict or hesitation. No meaningful internal contradiction acts in scene; the resolution ("each line of pain now a luminous rune of purpose") is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is established through her occupation and methods, but interiority remains largely abstract—"felt the weight lift" and "hoping the words would find Mara's ears" replace embodied contradiction. The apology is narrated rather than enacted through a costly present choice; the exorcist arranges objects and whispers, but no live decision forecloses a path on the page. Mara exists only as memory; no second character applies pressure. Minor: "gossip-column exorcist" and "induced currents" are label-heavy without grounding the actual struggle that would earn change.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a cipher; "end of history witness" remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Internal experience is absent—no competing impulses, no embodied emotion, no hierarchy of values tested on the page. The final vanishing reads as ornamental rather than earned by prior causality, and no credible path is foreclosed with visible cost. Motivation is declared ("unravel cosmic illusions") but never dramatized through conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The shepherd's interiority remains abstract and declarative throughout ("he realized that clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths"). Motivation is told rather than tested by contradictory impulses; the character observes and philosophizes but makes no costly micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse—"felt it as a heartbeat," "cool air brush his cheek"—and the final walk away lacks visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece gestures at internal complexity without dramatizing it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is a probability professor's daughter and compulsive gambler, but these traits remain labels without embodied contradiction in scene. Her choices (placing a coin, lifting the lantern, writing a theorem) follow a treasure-hunt logic with no internal conflict or visible cost. The mother's heart attack is mentioned once and never pressures a single decision. Interiority consists of expository summary ("She knew the library's labyrinthine stacks hid...") rather than present-tense struggle, and the final "theorem that embraced both certainty and chance" is asserted without dramatization or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is consistently abstract and label-dependent ("cultivated estrangement," "teaching endings how to begin") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "Thank you" voice at the end delivers closure through external validation rather than Mara's own earned choice or renunciation with visible cost. Lena's grief fragments are summarized rather than dramatized, and the final step out of the booth reads as symbolic gesture without foreclosing a path or revealing what Mara sacrifices. Internal conflict is told through philosophical claims rather than simultaneous opposing desires acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains a device rather than a character with agency; no choices, only ritualized action. Interiority consists entirely of label-emotion ("haunted euphoria," "reverence") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The "gently thorough" trait is mentioned but never constrains a decision or creates visible cost. Motivation is declared ("preserve the weight of small moments") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or stakes that force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira remains a vehicle for the concept rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "desperately jocular" trait is declared but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction—jokes are mentioned but not shown colliding with pressure. The crew of "misfit volunteers" appears mid-story without interior access or embodied tension, functioning as prop-movers. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she simply enacts a premise-driven plan without cost or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira exists as an assemblage of traits rather than a person making choices under pressure. Her "motivation…to navigate…interior seas" is declared but never dramatized through conflicted decisions; she simply follows the notes without obstacle or renunciation. The ending announces "map of her soul finally complete" in therapy-speak without embodied cost, and the character never faces a choice that forecloses a path. Interior contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly through the forest without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrator's interiority is heavily abstract and label-reliant ("confidently uncertain," "strange comfort") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The celestial signal interpreter role remains ornamental—no choices test professional knowledge against personal cost. Emotional progression consists of declared states ("I felt," "I realized") without the messy irrationality or visible tradeoffs that pressure would force. The final paragraph's therapeutic self-congratulation ("humbled and empowered") replaces earned struggle with summary assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arlen remains a flat archetype—"whispering advisor" with "quiet charisma"—whose interiority consists entirely of abstract motivation ("translate silence into music") without embodied contradiction or cost. The final paragraph lists "joyful sorrow" as a label rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses in scene. Lira's arrival introduces a second POV with no distinct perceptual signature; her instant mimicry of sign language and feeling the harbor "respond" reads as convenience rather than earned character knowledge. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; actions flow from premise rather than flawed human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout, defined by contradictory labels ("arsonist," "guardian") rather than embodied choices under pressure. The supposed redemption arc is told in summary across years rather than dramatized in scene; we never witness a micro-choice that costs him something legible. The "volcanic tenderness" is asserted repeatedly but never enacted through contradictory impulses in a single beat. Internal voice collapses into therapy-speak ("analytical intuition," "fierce love tempered by gentle heat") without the grit of actual thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's interiority is nearly absent; she functions as a symbolic conduit rather than a protagonist with contradictory impulses. The "quietly rebellious" trait is asserted in the opening line but never dramatized through a meaningful choice under pressure—drumming appears as a mystical act, not a decision with competing costs. The shift from experimental subject to legend occurs off-page through staff dreams, bypassing any on-page renunciation or alteration. Emotional progression is replaced by abstract cosmic communion; no embodied struggle or hierarchy of values emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.2)
    Milo's motivation is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses. His interior reads as stock experimentation ("calculated spontaneity") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The key beats—whispering into the coin, following the map—advance a ritual checklist without visible internal conflict or cost. The ending recycles the same stance without alteration or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    The guardian lacks interiority, contradictory impulses, or embodied emotion—it "felt," "understood," and moved with "spiralingly calm precision," but these are labels without psychological texture. No on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the mission completes without struggle or trade-off. The fisherman observes but does not pressure the guardian, leaving the protagonist untested. Motivation remains abstract ("teach darkness the value of stars") and is never dramatized as a conflicted want.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interior is entirely abstract—"quiet revolution," "gift," "humble rebellion"—with no embodied emotion or contradictory impulse visible in scene. Her motivation to plant "forests of second thoughts" is declared but never tested by a single on-page choice with visible cost. The students, neighbors, mayor, and townsfolk remain interchangeable labels; no relationship pressure or status dynamic appears. The final smile and cradling gesture are performed states, not lived friction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara's interiority is often asserted through abstract labels ("combative tenderness," "desire to protect") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her emotional arc from dock worker to island pilgrim feels more like a preordained mythic checklist than a path shaped by micro-choices under pressure. The final shift—"combative tenderness…would now defend the fragile peace"—is declared rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation on the page. Secondary characters (whale, spirits) exist as symbolic props without applying direct interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara reads as a blank vessel rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her motivation—"cultivating lightness in grief"—is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice that reveals internal friction or cost. The "morally ambiguous" attribute exists only as a label; no on-page action tests competing values. Interiority consists of therapeutic abstractions ("emotional void," "hollow that could be filled") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains abstract and label-driven throughout: "aesthetically driven," "cloud-shadow poet," "watercolor of doubts and dreams." No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the character moves through a sequence of declared states without friction. Motivation is asserted ("to stride through boundaries once thought sacred") but never tests commitment with visible cost or trade-off. The final threshold crossing feels ornamental rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    Selene's motivation ("trading doubts for beauty") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her "innocently cunning" trait remains label-only; no on-page micro-choice reveals a cost or hierarchy of values. The glassblower appears as audience in a single beat without applying pressure. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("fractured palette of her own sight") rather than embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    The bell ringer's interiority is consistently abstract ("texture of connection," "golden shadows of mutual awareness") rather than embodied. Motivation remains declarative—the character performs actions to serve theme rather than facing contradictory impulses under pressure. No genuine internal conflict appears; the progression from question to result unfolds without obstacle or cost to the protagonist. The artificial mind's "soft sigh" attempts emotional resonance, but the bell ringer's own stakes and transformation are never concretized.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The jewelry maker's interiority is highly abstract and label-driven throughout ("desolation," "quiet fire," "subdued ardor") without embodied contradictions or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy under pressure. Her transformation from grief to light-keeper is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; the shift feels thematic rather than psychological. The rose-revival moment reads as symbolic action without clear decision or trade-off, and visitors arrive as passive recipients rather than forces requiring choice. No genuine internal conflict constrains her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer remains too abstract throughout; her motivations are told ("steadily curious," "inherited mystery") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal life consists largely of poetic declaration ("She whispered to the void, confiding that the pattern she sought was not merely profit, but a blueprint of hope") without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The final walk into the night feels like a pose rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost—no visible tradeoff or renunciation occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The historian remains a cipher throughout; motivation is asserted ("sole motivation was to pursue forbidden knowledge") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interior experience consists of label-only emotions ("anguished joy," "bittersweet surge") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The protagonist's "steadily unpredictable" mind is told, not shown through decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. No meaningful choice alters tactics; the historian walks, reads, and exits without agency that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains essentially passive—watching, sensing, and whispering—without genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His transformation from observer to actor happens through decorative gestures (lifting a stone, whispering to it) rather than a choice that forecloses a meaningful path with visible cost. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous regret," "gentle certainty") and therapy-adjacent diction ("metamorphose his perception") that never ground in specific, character-particular sensation. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; the stone warms conveniently, validating him without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to "balance self-respect and compassion" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her actions follow a linear therapeutic arc—gathering discarded objects, arranging them, watching layers fall away—without genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. The chameleon functions as passive witness rather than pressure source, and the "fragile convictions" never wobble concretely on the page after the opening claim. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the balance she sought...tugging like a taut string") rather than character-particular perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "closure seeker" motivation is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—the protagonist moves through beats without interior friction or visible cost to choices. Interiority leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("my mind, still fogged, clung to the lingering taste of chlorinated air") that reads more like atmospheric narration than character-particular thought. The moss interaction and hourglass ritual proceed without on-page resistance or trade-offs that would reveal hierarchy of values. The final "closure I had sought for years" is declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.2)
    The crystal gazer remains a label without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Interiority consists entirely of abstract mystical declarations ("incubate goodbye letters," "unused love") rather than concrete stakes or micro-choices under pressure. The final act—placing the film strip back and vanishing—reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path. No relationship crucible exists; the protagonist operates in isolation with shadows as audience.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist remains a cipher throughout—"moonstruck dreamer" is a label, not a character with distinct motives or contradictory impulses. Interior access is entirely abstract ("shadowed rapture," "unvoiced poems surge through his veins") with no embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final "rest had birthed a new constellation of ideas" declares transformation without earning it through on-page conflict or cost. Agency is absent; the dreamer observes and receives rather than deciding.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guard's dreamless state and longing for renewal are established, but interiority remains abstract—"odd tug at his pulse," "surge of longing"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final smile and "fleeting warmth" gesture toward change, but the progression feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests the protagonist's stance. Motivation is present but not dramatized through friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philosopher remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, no meaningful internal conflict. His "motivation" is stated ("rediscover the wild frontier of his mind") but never dramatized through competing wants or costs; he simply drifts, places a gear, and smiles. The piece offers therapy-speak epiphanies ("reclamation of internal wilderness") without grounding them in on-page struggle or decision that forecloses a path. No secondary character pressure exists, and the protagonist never faces a choice where values collide.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's motivation—to find unused courage—is told rather than dramatized through internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The cave discovery and chest opening feel choreographed rather than earned by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The "map of the inner self" epiphany arrives as an abstract gift rather than through struggle, and the final "reclaimed courage" reads like a therapeutic label instead of embodied cost. Ferry guides remain observation figures without decisions that create turns.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.2)
    The bellhop remains an allegorical placeholder—"seraphically mundane" is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His motivations are inferred from symbolic gestures (placing the bolt) rather than dramatized through internal conflict or competing wants. The guests exist as a collective abstraction ("they") with no individuated stakes or reactions, flattening what could be relational pressure. The nerve-regeneration premise is told as ambient metaphor, not anchored in bodily sensation or choice-altering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    The titan remains largely abstract throughout, defined by metaphor ("small enough to slip between towering scrolls yet radiating a presence that felt almost planetary") rather than embodied choice. No internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure appear; he simply follows the ink's guidance without friction. The spectral pretender arrives only to be dispatched in summary ("trembling as the rune's truth stripped away his borrowed sovereignty"), never forcing a decision that reveals the titan's values. The piece tells us he feels "quiet pride that was both grand and modest" without dramatizing what that costs him.

    Mara and Eli remain thinly sketched; their interior lives are told rather than embodied. "Periodically eternal" is asserted as a mental state without concrete micro-choices that reveal contradiction or cost. The final "glance" exchange and log entry feel like summary gestures rather than decisions that foreclose paths with visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stargazer remains an archetype rather than a character; interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are absent. Her "awkward confidence" is declared but never embodied in conflicting impulses or on-page hesitations. The transformation—from solitary observer to communal leader—occurs without visible internal cost or foreclosed paths. Workers emerge as props, not pressures; no relationship forces a choice that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.2)
    Anara's motivation to "evolve tradition with intent" is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses under pressure. The telepathic bond with plants remains ornamental—a label that enables discovery but never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. The final turn (offering a memory) feels arbitrary; no prior beat establishes what she values or risks losing, so the sacrifice lacks weight. Interior voice is generic and therapy-adjacent ("swell of purpose," "collective heartbeat").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist exhibits clear motivation (anchor optimism in realism) and embodied grief through the photograph, but interiority leans heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers," "freeze her panic") and therapeutic framing that flattens crisis particularity. The climactic moment—kneeling by the sapling and making a promise—lacks contradictory impulses; the choice reads smoothly resolved rather than fraught. Emotional progression is tidy rather than credibly irrational, and the "quietly talented gait" remains a label without demonstrable constraint or enabling action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation (seeking redesign after unappreciated work) is established but remains abstract. The portrait artist's interior life leans heavily on atmospheric label-speak ("luminescent ache," "crestfallen") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final turn—accepting fragmentation as canvas—arrives through realization rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path with cost. No secondary character appears to test his stance in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation ("to discover why time slows in crisis") is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page choice or trade-off. His "serene anger" is labeled repeatedly but remains unembodied—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously, no micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The closing declaration ("the world would no longer be caught unaware") asserts resolution without dramatizing how his understanding changed or what path was foreclosed. Interior voice recycles elevated diction ("fragile thread," "tapestry of existence") without perceptual specificity or embodied emotion under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren's motivation is declared but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "bravely conflicted" label appears repeatedly without dramatized internal friction that would force micro-choices with visible cost. The final stance—watching the conversation unfold—feels passive; the action (inserting the letter) happens early, and afterward she becomes an observer rather than an agent facing new trade-offs. Embodied emotion is sparse; phrases like "the brave conflict within her burned brighter" summarize rather than show contradictory pulls in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation ("to weave continuity through chaos") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—whispering to plants, distributing rose petals—remain symbolic and never face a genuine obstacle that would test commitment or reveal internal conflict. The ending distributes petals to villagers in a choreographed tableau without visible cost or a path foreclosed. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") instead of specific, embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    The fisher remains passive throughout, observing and following garden cues rather than making choices under pressure. Interiority consists largely of abstract poetic labels ("vessel that transliterates emotions") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions. The character's "cool-headed" trait is asserted but never tested; no internal conflict forces a difficult trade-off. The ending describes him casting a net but no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira's motivation is declared ("to discover hidden truths") but never tested by internal contradiction or genuine friction. Her actions follow a smooth, unopposed track—insert pen, decipher code, hand it off—without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The journalist appears as a receiving device rather than a relationship under stress, and the final exchange ("any writer who wishes to intervene…") reads as thematic summary rather than character-specific speech. No visible cost forecloses a path; the "orbits of regret" unwind off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's motivation—hushing old guilt—is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Interior experience consists of generic phrases like "dissonance inside her chest loosen" without character-particular texture. The final "unwavering resolve" and stepping out with glimmering tattoo read as label-only triumph rather than earned change through visible struggle. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; the protagonist moves through the plot without meaningful internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    Liora's motivation "to discover meaning in the mess" is declared but never tested by a conflicting want or cost. Her actions—drawing mandalas, whispering to the tile—proceed without internal resistance or embodied stakes. The violinist arrives as a second character but adds no pressure or relationship crucible; he simply echoes her gestures. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The "gentle radical" remains an abstract concept rather than an embodied person with contradictory impulses. His interiority consists of label-only feelings ("retrocognitively trapped," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") without concrete embodiment or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The protagonist's final realization—"knowing at last that mercy, once aberrant, had become the world's new foundation"—reads as unearned epiphany rather than earned change tied to prior causality. No internal conflict shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ghost's motivation—"desperate for one final encore"—is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("yearning to intertwine past applause with present longing") and label-speak ("synesthetically blessed") rather than embodied emotion. The shopkeeper's late arrival introduces a second character whose agency resolves the conflict without prior stake, undermining the ghost's arc. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ghost simply "felt his essence expand" and achieves peace through passive observation of the shopkeeper's wish.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract conceptual connections ("hidden geometry," "somatic markers," "neural resonance") rather than embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The protagonist moves through a linear chain of successful experiments without meaningful internal conflict or cost; her "affectionate skepticism" is told but never dramatized through a difficult choice between doubt and belief. Emotional states are labeled ("hope," "purpose") rather than shown through physical sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The final "whisper of another mind" arrives as a convenient validation rather than an earned transformation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    The map maker lacks concrete wants in tension; her "motivation" is stated as abstract purpose ("to become the voice of the unknown") but never dramatized through a live choice with visible cost. Interiority reads as lyric assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist observes and enacts ritual gestures, but no decision forecloses a path or reveals competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation—"quietly inspired by the notion that every grain of sand carried shared wisdom"—is abstract and label-driven, never tested by contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Her actions proceed smoothly without internal friction; when she "understood" and "realized," the epiphanies are asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle. No visible choice forecloses a path with felt cost; the hourglass turns, the prophecy resolves, and the ending grants satisfaction without sacrifice. Interiority relies heavily on stock phrases ("unearthed silence," "collective memory") and therapy-adjacent abstraction instead of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.2)
    The burned spy remains abstract throughout, defined by symbolic guilt rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("the guilt a scar that never healed") and therapy-speak labels without embodied contradiction. The character's transformation from guilt to redemption arrives through magical objects and ritual rather than earned choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. No micro-decisions reveal a hierarchy of values; the protagonist moves through the valley without resistance or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Arlen's interiority is abstract and elevated rather than embodied—"distill the complexity of the river's memory" reads like thesis statement, not lived thought. The yarn needle returns but never constrains a choice with visible cost; his "invisible stitching" and percolation metaphors remain decorative. No genuine internal conflict appears; he moves through contemplation to resolution without contradiction or struggle. The final "smile" and light heart arrive unearned by on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior life is consistently present—her belief in fractured timelines, her intention to understand, her benediction—but her agency never faces a high-stakes choice with visible cost. The "thrum" and lantern responses are perceptual events she observes rather than dilemmas she resolves through internal contradiction. Her final departure reads as contemplative closure but lacks the embodied cost or renunciation that would make the change legible. The zen-potter archetype remains static; no flaw or competing impulse disrupts her patient kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to plant luminous vines is signaled early and her actions are consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—"protected vulnerability" and "wistfully pragmatic" are labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The choice to plant vines feels preordained rather than earned through on-page pressure; no competing impulse or cost visibly forecloses a path. The lockmaster's tooth adjusts a latch, but this micro-choice carries no felt stakes or visible trade-off that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.2)
    Mira remains abstract throughout—no bodily sensation, no contradictory impulses under pressure, only declarative interiority ("felt the brittle awakenings," "understood") that reads like summary rather than dramatized choice. The sky-whale is ornamental texture, not a second character applying pressure. Motivation is asserted ("to translate isolation into independence") but never tested by a concrete trade-off or micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final "smile" and "ready to write" are unearned epiphanies without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's interior is told rather than embodied; her "motivation was simple yet profound" arrives as exposition. The critical choice to step onto the spiral and "rejoin" lacks prior contradiction or struggle—she drifts toward it without visible cost or foreclosed path. Diagnostic label-speak ("keeper of secrets…inevitably whimsical") and summary interiority ("She realized…") replace scene pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains a label rather than a lived consciousness; her "cautiously hopeful" stance is stated repeatedly but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in the same beat. The cascade of students, dean, townspeople, and cosmic tricksters dilutes focus without individuating any voice or creating relational pressure. Interior experience consists of abstract declarations ("felt the weight of all the charts") rather than embodied perception under stress, and the final "smile" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    The claustrophobic explorer is labeled rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears as "prudently adventurous" label without dramatized tension between caution and daring in pivotal moments. The emotional arc from claustrophobia to freedom is asserted through abstract philosophy ("rebellion against the limits he once knew") rather than embodied in specific action. The final beat's "carrying the mutiny of space within his heart" reads as placeholder sentiment disconnected from prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains a collection of labels—"face blind portrait artist," "methodical"—rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Her interiority consists of therapy-speak abstractions ("dormant empathy," "alchemy of rigor and compassion") without specific micro-choices under pressure. The promised central tension—blindness vs. seeing—never manifests as dramatized conflict; she simply paints and whispers promises without visible struggle or cost. Actions are asserted via summary ("She felt a tremor," "she sensed") rather than shown through concrete choices that foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is defined by label-only traits ("nervously confident," "idealistic") rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation to honor her ancestor exists as declared backstory, never tested by a meaningful on-page trade-off or obstacle that would reveal character under pressure. The crew rallying sequence feels externalized and convenient; no micro-choice shows Mara weighing cost or risk. Emotional states are asserted ("dread settle into resolve") rather than embodied through specific perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    The fiddler exists primarily as a vessel for ornamental atmosphere rather than as a character with embodied interiority or contradictory impulses. His motivations are declared ("to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") but never tested through on-page choices with visible cost—he simply executes a predetermined ritual. The "luminous disbelief" is asserted repeatedly as a label rather than shown through embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The hitchhiker remains an abstract narrative token; no relationship or status dynamic creates pressure because no second character is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arlen is granted interiority and a consistent trait (polished calm), but his choices across the piece feel more observed than embodied. The pivot from startup rise to train markers to dawn walk reads as conceptual movement rather than struggle; no on-page impulse forces him to *test* the calm he inherited. The foreign-currency motif and the circus-train boundary-setting are gestures toward internal stakes, yet they never press him into a visible trade-off or foreclose a path with dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara operates as a label ("lucid dream chronicler") rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her interiority consists of abstract declarations—"words could heal with words," "understanding dawns only when the stars themselves shift"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The decoding task unfolds through passive witnessing and whispered affirmations rather than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the burden "lifts" conveniently without dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)
    The druid remains a vessel for orchestrated actions rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "guarded" nature and "warlike serenity" are asserted labels that never manifest as on-page tension between competing desires—she moves through each beat with perfect calibration. The retrieval of the amulet and binding of the seed read as checklist fulfillment rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. Interiority consists entirely of stock mystical declarations ("she has sworn," "she knows") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "root-bound visionary" is labeled purposefully curious but never faces a choice that tests or contradicts that trait with cost. Interiority consists of abstract claims ("anxious elation," "steady resolve") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist experiences no genuine internal conflict; every impulse aligns conveniently with the next beat, and the final "smile" declares satisfaction without forfeiting anything on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("anxious elation") appears repeatedly without dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maelia's motivation to "patch holes in her soul" is consistently referenced but remains abstract; the story tells us she is a "reckless idealist" without dramatizing a live choice that tests competing impulses under pressure. The burned tarot card and bartered destinies function as symbolic furniture rather than constraints that force visible trade-offs. Interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve") and the final action—placing the card and walking away—feels predetermined rather than earned through prior contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is drowned in abstract, therapeutic self-narration ("insulating emotionally with facts," "confidently uncertain," "after the applause") that never embodies contradiction in concrete action. Emotions are labeled and philosophized rather than dramatized through embodied perception under pressure. The final "calm resolve" arrives as assertion, not earned through a visible choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The brass compass vignette gestures at character alignment but remains ornamental summary.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "kindly methodical" nature appears as a label without constraining choices or creating visible trade-offs. The character remains observational throughout, with agency expressed primarily through setup actions (planting the seed, whispering verses) rather than decisions that foreclose paths with felt cost. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("physics of transition," "analogical thinking") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The titan-gear librarian possesses clear motivation (preserve wonder in routine) and executes a decisive action (smelting the key), but his interior life remains abstract and decorative. The character's bronze-and-gears composition is told rather than embodied through specific constraint or trade-off; no moment shows his mechanical nature limiting or enabling a choice under pressure. The final stance—opening blank volumes, thanking the creel—lacks visible cost or contradiction that would foreclose a path. The piece describes a figure performing symbolic actions rather than dramatizing a mind wrestling with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.2)
    Mara remains an abstraction throughout. Her role as "bunker inspector" never shapes a single choice or reaction; she moves through the cave as a passive vessel for the pearl ritual. No contradictory impulses surface—she kneels, reads, whispers, and places without hesitation or internal conflict. The closing vow to "spread the method" arrives unearned, a label grafted onto a character who never wrestled with competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation (self-forgiveness via river-chronicling) is stated but not dramatized through competing desires or embodied contradiction. Internal life consists largely of poetic assertion rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final promise to return reads as declaration rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in "ache of a body" and accordion-playing moments, but interiority often slips into therapy-speak ("path to self-forgiveness," "cartography of the soul") without grounding in specific sensory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "veiled dreamer" remains a cipher throughout—no distinct interiority, no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses. The protagonist's motivation is declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost; the watch-decoding proceeds without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths. Interiority consists of stock phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "heart swelling") rather than character-particular perception. The final "vow" arrives without dramatized internal conflict or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("lattice of archives," "perforated destiny") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation ("to weigh a dream against an empire") is declared but never tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "propagate the vines' dissent" arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed path—the empire simply agrees, and she records provenance afterward with labeled "mulberry ache" rather than dramatized grief. Embodiment is largely absent; emotions are named ("heavy," "lightened") rather than shown through involuntary physical response.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The beautician mortician's interiority is abstract and decorative rather than concrete: "lucidly watchful" and "reverent purpose" are labels without embodied contradiction or particular texture. No genuine internal conflict surfaces—she experiences no doubt, cost, or friction in her task. The final promise to stillness and the act of placing the chip feel ceremonial rather than rooted in character-specific need. Minor positive: her ritual actions (tracing, listening for static) create consistent micro-choices, but they advance atmosphere more than personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's actions are coherent (tending vines, placing the hairpin) but her interior life remains abstract—forgiveness and contentment are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "scalloping" heart and "kindly decisive" labels appear as traits without showing the competing goods or visible cost that would earn a transformation. Emotional progression is smooth rather than credibly irrational; the final contentment arrives without struggle or forfeiture. No on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's profession is labeled ("conscience for hire," "sincerely insincere") but these traits never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Her internal contradiction is asserted repeatedly—"pretended to shrug off the weight while internally tallying each whispered wind"—yet no moment shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously to force a difficult trade-off. The magistrate remains off-page; his "softening jaw" is projected via lantern flicker, never tested through direct pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "weight of others' unresolved guilt," "fragile peace she had helped forge."

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's reverse-aging condition is established but never tested under pressure; the grotto lesson arrives as declaration rather than earned choice. Interior texture relies heavily on abstract meditation language ("weaves truth carefully," "withhold perception") that describes stance without embodying contradiction or cost. The final realization—that the grotto teaches "appearing as one vanishes"—reads as philosophical summary rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is told more than shown through on-page tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist remains a static observer throughout; she watches, waits, and "lets" events guide her rather than making choices that alter outcomes. Interior experience is heavily abstracted through poetry ("letting the wave guide her thoughts") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final "turn" is told as accomplished fact ("she held the means to appraise") without on-page struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared historically reverent but never tested by a conflicting impulse or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    Selric's underachieving status is asserted but his choices rarely compel genuine conflict or cost. The internal contradiction—lingering luminance as both flaw and gift—remains abstract, never dramatized through competing impulses in a single beat. The "unstrapping" gesture and palm-on-stone moment are symbolic rather than choices that foreclose paths; the transformation from underachiever to fulfilled mage occurs through declaration rather than earned agency. Embodied emotion is minimal; "doubts dissolve" and "magic ignites" without physical manifestation or visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    Eli's motivation to "discover the color of sound" is told, not dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. His journey unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion—he simply follows steps to a revelation that arrives without cost or renunciation. The interiority relies on abstract phrases ("luminous vow," "meteor hush") rather than character-particular thought patterns, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The final "fulfillment" lacks visible cost; Eli's vow is satisfied rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas's motivation ("wavelength align with purpose") is declared but not embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt," "uneasy certainty") without showing embodied emotion or internal conflict that would compel higher-stakes decisions. The final "alignment" is asserted rather than earned through a visible trade-off or forfeiture that forecloses a path with felt cost. No secondary character is present to test status dynamics or relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira's motivation to name nameless fears is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her lost sailor memory arrives as convenient backstory without altering present choices. The naming sequence proceeds mechanically without visible cost or internal resistance—each crystal obligingly releases its terror without forcing Lira to sacrifice anything on the page. Interiority relies on abstract declaration ("her heart ached") rather than embodied sensation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    The mage is presented through abstract labels ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. His interior life consists of philosophical reflection about cosmic balance rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The rebuilding process unfolds without genuine struggle or mistake; competence is asserted rather than tested. The final "smile" and realized wisdom feel unearned because no visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path—he simply succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Caitlyn's "vigilant" and "precisely humane" traits remain label-only; no on-page contradiction or internal conflict dramatizes cost. Her walk, scan, and reading aloud lack micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The grandfather's teaching and mother's symbol are told backstory without anchoring in present action that changes stance. Townspeople gather as a static audience rather than applying secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    Selene is presented through declarations rather than contradiction under pressure. The "secretly sentimental" trait is told and illustrated with firefly memories but never constrains a present choice with visible cost. The ritual proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Auburn curls and scholarly robes function as costume rather than embodied character particulars that shape perception or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The seeker's interiority remains abstract and repetitive across the piece—"attentively inventive," "watcher's burden," and similar labels recur without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The harness revision is externalized choreography rather than a window into competing impulses. The outpost crew's gratitude at the end gestures toward relational stakes but arrives too late to test the protagonist under interpersonal pressure. Muscle memory and the buckle provide concrete anchors, but the seeker's internal experience never deviates from a single reverent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation ("defeat emotional numbness") is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The "ego death survivor" backstory remains abstract label-speak without showing how this history constrains his present choices. Mara appears at the end as a teaching vessel, and the Guardians/Syndicate function as ornamental obstacles rather than characters who force trade-offs. The climactic "slice" reads as convenient resolution without visible cost or internal conflict—Kael's emotional numbness simply "cracks" without earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conductor is presented through heavy symbolic abstraction rather than concrete contradiction or embodied choice. "Mournfully eager" remains a label rather than acting in scene through simultaneous opposing impulses. The final "satisfaction" reads as declared resolution without visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority is poetic but generic, never grounded in a character-particular way of perceiving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.2)
    The guardian's internal life consists almost entirely of abstract labels ("dimensionally homesick," "yearning to make friends with uncertainty") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The shift from "feral" to "curator" is told rather than earned through dramatized cost; no on-page renunciation or stance crystallization occurs. Interiority reads generic and therapy-adjacent ("interiorizing exteriors," "foggy lucidity") without character-particular texture. The pendant is approached with "tentative reverence" but no conflicting impulse acts in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    The alchemist remains a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a person making contradictory choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of label-only states ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless," "quiet triumph") without embodied sensation or visceral contradiction. The protagonist never makes a difficult trade-off; each step succeeds incrementally without cost, and the final "revival" arrives without any visible price paid—no exhaustion, no resource depletion, no relational or moral friction. Therapy-speak and diagnostic phrasing ("stoically sensitive," "fragile curiosity") recur throughout, flattening the character into a mood board.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.2)
    Selin remains thinly characterized throughout, defined primarily by her occupation rather than contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Her "practical" approach to starlight and her climactic whisper of intention read as label-only traits without micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The piece tells us she "refused to let nostalgia cloud the data" but never dramatizes a moment where nostalgia and pragmatism collide with visible cost. The final smile and confidence feel asserted rather than earned through on-page transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lio's motivation ("to merge parallel timelines") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict. His "resiliently positive grin" functions as a label rather than an embodied trait that constrains choice under pressure. The hourglass and radio feel like symbolic props rather than objects that reveal character through use; no micro-choices expose a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending grants him success without foreclosing a path or showing what he sacrifices to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "fever dream architect" remains purely label-only throughout; no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or embodied emotion appears. His "unsettlingly calm" purpose is declared but never tested by pressure—he encounters no obstacle, makes no choice with visible cost, and experiences no change. The piece presents a tourist moving through set-pieces rather than a character whose flaws or desires drive difficult decisions. Motivation is asserted ("to discover the texture of connection") but never dramatized through friction between want and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira is characterized entirely through exposition and summary rather than embodied action under pressure. Her "balancedly curious" temperament is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses or difficult choices on the page. The piece offers no moment where she struggles, makes a mistake rooted in her limits, or pays a personal cost—only passive observation and abstract plotting. Internal experience remains at the level of assertion ("she felt," "she imagined") without bodily specificity or self-contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is labeled "contact tracer for hearts" and "persistently curious," but these traits function as ornament rather than constraint. No genuine interior contradiction appears; the narrator glides through the atrium without facing competing impulses or paying a visible price for curiosity. The final "promise to guard this echo" arrives unearned by prior struggle, reading as declarative rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("weight of incidental heroism") and the entire arc feels like observation rather than embodied decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's claustrophobia is mentioned but never constrains a choice or generates embodied tension in the cramped facility. Her motivation "to stand by the unremembered" remains abstract throughout; no micro-choice forces her to weigh competing costs or forecloses a path with visible consequence. Interiority defaults to stock formulations ("her breath shallow," "her claustrophobic heart finally at ease") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act buries the codex without dramatizing what she sacrifices or refuses to achieve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("fetch wisdom from failure," "miscounted beats") rather than embodied contradiction. The digital ghost remains a conceptual device; no genuine internal conflict arises between impulses in scene. The final "smile" and alignment with "the universe's quiet song" read as stock closure rather than earned transformation with visible cost. Motivation is declared but not dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    The storyteller's motivation (translate texture into sound) is abstract and never tested by concrete obstacles or contradictory impulses. His "copper veins" and "quietly articulate" voice are labels without embodied contradiction or on-page cost; he performs a ritual successfully without struggle, internal friction, or trade-off. The flawed diamond's transformation and the birds' response happen without the protagonist making a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned—he smiles and walks away after achieving his goal with no visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exhibits no meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion; interiority consists entirely of abstract mission-speak ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") without contradiction or cost. The "bitterness inside me loosen" moment arrives unearned, a declared epiphany rather than a dramatized shift. The cryptid researcher cover remains ornamental—no on-page choice tests the undercover stance or creates friction between researcher identity and herbalist fascination. Actions are observational rather than pressured; the placement of the arrowhead and subsequent events feel like staged choreography without agency-driven risk.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.2)
    The violinist remains an abstraction—described through his instruments and actions but never particularized through embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or genuine interiority. The statues shift from enforcers to allies without any on-page struggle or visible cost to their allegiance; their "cracks of curiosity" read as convenient stage direction. No moment reveals the protagonist's hierarchy of values or forecloses a path with dramatized cost. The entire arc is asserted through summary rather than lived choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.2)
    Milo's interiority is abstract and label-driven throughout ("respectfully rebellious gait," "quiet purpose"), never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The mission to "foster a fragile peace by linking absences" remains a telling assertion with no dramatized internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. His actions—slipping the envelope, lifting the bottle—read as moves in service of the concept rather than character-specific decisions shaped by fear or want. The ending claims weight lifted ("the weight of his respectful rebellion ease into a quiet purpose") but offers no on-page renunciation or alteration earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains abstract throughout—her interiority consists almost entirely of thematic labels ("interpret silence as possibility") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us she "understood" and "realized" repeatedly without dramatizing a single moment of genuine internal conflict or a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "smiled, realizing" is pure summary, offering no embodied emotion or contradictory impulse. No secondary character appears to create relational pressure, and Mara's agency never moves beyond passive reception of mystical phenomena.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara remains a cipher throughout: "sanely eccentric" is label-only, never constraining a choice or creating visible cost. Her interiority consists entirely of exposition about analog memories and hyperbolic geometry—she whispers algorithms and adjusts scarves, but no competing impulse or doubt appears. The patrons exist as backdrop without distinct personalities or pressure on Mara's actions. No meaningful change or endurance with foreclosed path occurs; she simply logs the event and waits for the next cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is highly abstract and lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation ("to capture a runaway dream") is told through backstory rather than tested through on-page choices with visible cost. The merchant's tale and the pearl function as exposition rather than dramatic friction. Lio appears briefly but applies no relational pressure; his sudden attunement reads as authorial convenience rather than earned connection.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.2)
    The locksmith remains a cipher throughout; no contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. Interiority consists entirely of abstract longing ("improbable longing," "enveloped secrets") without character-particular thought or bodily reaction. The final act—freeing the lock of hair—feels unmotivated because no prior scene establishes what the locksmith risks or loses. Agency is gestural: he whispers, twists, and departs, but no choice forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    The folklorist remains a label-only construct: "chronically curious" is told, not shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal competing values. Interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("the truth settled like freshly turned soil") and generic wonder without embodied cost. The memory-recovery mission proceeds without genuine friction—no moment where curiosity conflicts with safety, fatigue, or doubt. The ending grants success without a visible tradeoff that would have foreclosed an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist remains a walking label collection—"combative tenderness," "mentor resilience quietly"—rather than a person with contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Her backwards-walking nervousness appears twice but never constrains a choice or creates friction; it's ornamental. The emotional progression from nervous to confident is asserted through summary ("confidence took the place of retreat") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; she executes her archival quest without any competing desire or cost that would make her decisions revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    The pruner is a vessel for poetic action rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. Interiority consists entirely of reverential abstraction ("insatiably creative, dreaming of new flavors") with no micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The traveler arrives late and departs as a convenience device. No agency choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the pruner simply tends, whispers, and gifts without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior life is painted entirely in abstract-poetic language ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest") rather than concrete, embodied emotion or contradiction. The piece tells us she feels "calm resolve" and "lucid unrest" but never dramatizes a choice under competing pressures or shows her wrestle with a live dilemma. Her actions proceed mechanically—locate knot, pierce, release spirit—without visible cost, hesitation, or trade-off. The final "promise" and her decision to tuck the mask away read as summary rather than earned transformation rooted in prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is stated rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Her actions follow a methodical routine (setting up projector, noting shadows, tracing glyphs) but lack internal conflict or competing impulses that would reveal character-particular struggle. The final "shielded openness" is asserted as interiority rather than shown through embodied contradiction. No meaningful cost forecloses a path; the chapel simply "sighs open," presenting discovery without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mort exists solely as a perceptual vehicle; no interiority creates tension or micro-choices under pressure. His "mission" is stated but never tested by competing wants or costs. The piece uses therapy-speak ("physics of letting go," "transformation of energy") as epiphany without dramatized struggle. Embodied emotion is absent—he "smiled," "sensed," "realized" without contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    The balladeer's motivation is declared but never contested or tested through internal conflict. He performs elaborate encoding actions without hesitation, confusion, or embodied struggle—no contradictory impulses act in scene. The ghost's satisfaction arrives without the balladeer paying a visible emotional or physical cost; the resolution reads as mutual recognition rather than an earned change that forecloses a path. Interiority remains conceptual and abstract ("articulate unspoken needs") rather than character-particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Ascending Servant's motivation ("to seek out the joy beneath anguish") is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page conflict. Internal experience remains abstract; we see him "feeling the affection of those long-gone engineers seep into his bones" but no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The final retrieval of crystal jars proceeds without meaningful cost or choice that forecloses a path. Affectionate detachment is named repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's motivation—to prove that empty spaces remember—is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her method of categorizing clouds by emotion appears as contemplative observation without visible internal conflict or cost. The protagonist remains in static vigil throughout; no micro-choices under pressure test her commitment or reveal a hierarchy of values. Emotions are labeled ("hope," "grief," "reverence") rather than embodied through contradictory physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's face-blindness is label-only; it never constrains a choice or shapes perception on the page. Her motivation to "mirror the sky" is declared but not tested against competing desires or material limits. The prose recycles "fractally precise" as a tic rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path—Lira completes the mural and smiles, satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation is asserted rather than tested through contradictory pressures. Her actions—tracing squares, aligning phrases—read as procedural steps without embodied emotion or internal conflict. The final success arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options; she "steps back" with "quiet pride" in a moment that feels decorative rather than earned. Interiority remains at the surface with stock exploratory enthusiasm never complicated by doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith remains abstract—a cipher pursuing "the rhythm of repair" without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. His motivation is declared ("simple yet ancient") but never tested by competing wants or costs; he encounters no friction, makes no trade-offs, and experiences no transformation beyond retrieving a gear. The final moment ("heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia, yet hopeful") asserts feeling rather than earning it through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    Liora the ghost has no interior contradiction, no embodied emotion, and makes no choices under pressure—she observes, whispers, and watches without conflict or cost. The villagers are interchangeable; Old Mara and the unnamed child pursue no contradictory impulses. No micro-choice alters present options, and the collective gathering proceeds without friction or trade-off. The ending grants Liora a "strange surge of trust" as pure assertion, not earned dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared rather than dramatized: the childhood sailor mission and the "pane of hush" quest remain abstract without concrete stakes testing her commitment. Interiority relies heavily on poetic labels ("bruised awe," "coil around her heart") instead of embodied contradiction. The broken puppet head acts as symbolic cargo without forcing a meaningful trade-off or choice that reveals her values under pressure. No internal conflict manifests in competing impulses—her path is linear exposition dressed in lyric language.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caretaker protagonist exists primarily as a vessel to execute the ritual rather than a mind under pressure. Interiority consists of observation and description ("I watch," "I approach") without internal contradiction or embodied emotion at key turns. The bargain and reluctance are declared but never tested on the page; no micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values or forces a trade-off between duty and self-preservation. The final withdrawal reads more like procedural completion than earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's professional identity is established, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("symphonically minded," "loosened grief"). The failed experiment and atonement motive are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her leap from observing foam to designing a polymer bridge lacks on-page struggle or embodied cost—the insight arrives too cleanly. The final choice to return each spring feels declarative rather than earned through prior causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    The vendor's motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") is declared but never tested or complicated by on-page pressure. His smile and fulfilled purpose arrive without any visible struggle, foreclosure, or cost—he achieves his goal by placing a bottle and watching. The child appears late and remains generic (no distinct voice, no contradictory impulses), functioning as a recipient rather than a pressure source. Interiority consists of abstract philosophical claims ("understood now that the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment") that read as unearned epiphany rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Chef Lir's gift to "taste memories" is established early but remains abstract; his interiority consists largely of sensory impressions ("bitter as burnt cumin") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The protagonist's agency centers on a ritualistic process rather than choices under pressure—he moves through predetermined steps without visible friction or cost that would narrow options. No secondary character appears to test his stance, and the final "quiet gratitude" feels declared rather than earned by a dramatized change that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    The librarian is presented through descriptive labels ("harmonious choral," "empathetically decisive") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivations are asserted—"vowed to rehabilitate," "believed"—without on-page friction or visible trade-offs. The final sequence shows her conducting and placing the weight, but no choice forecloses a path with felt cost; she walks bridges others built and confirms success without struggle. Interiority remains abstract and therapeutic ("vigorous tenderness," "surge") rather than embodied and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's motivation to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is declared but never tested through genuine friction or cost; she proceeds smoothly from setup to triumph without internal contradiction or a moment where her aspiration conflicts with immediate price. The interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("chaotically precise," "helix-minded") that function as labels rather than embodied thought under pressure. Emotions are asserted through elevated diction ("quaking reverie," "heart quaked") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. A micro-choice to "press on" after a tremor gestures toward struggle but lacks visible consequence that alters her later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora's motivation is declared but never tested by a meaningful internal conflict or contradiction. Her "prism-minded" trait and tattoos remain label-only descriptions without shaping on-page choices under pressure. The "latent blaze" and "seeds of vigilance" are abstract metaphors recycled as felt states rather than embodied through concrete action or micro-decisions. The final promise to the glyph reads as summary rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    Auris's motivation is stated ("fierce need to create music in a silent world") but his interior experience remains abstract and label-driven. The porcelain insulator and stress-crack method are actions performed on objects rather than choices under pressure that reveal competing impulses. The hedgehog appears twice as a witness but exerts no pressure, and no embodied contradiction drives the protagonist's decisions—he simply executes a plan without friction or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    The tutor remains an abstraction; "thoughtfully precise in every move" is declared but never dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of elevated philosophical musing ("hopeful melancholy," "aching beauty") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The imagined chess board and stone-whispering operate as symbolic gestures rather than decisions with foreclosed paths or visible cost. No meaningful change or endurance is earned—he walks toward dimming light with the same resolve he began with.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is labeled "eclectic pacifist" and "conductor of compassion" but performs no character-particular choices under pressure; he simply executes a predetermined ritual. Interiority is generic and inflated ("his intuition intuitively descriptive, painting the vibrations in his mind as ripples of copper, lavender, and old parchment"), relying on stock theatrical gestures rather than contradictory impulses. The final vow to "share these cataloged silences" arrives without internal conflict or visible cost, reading as declarative summary rather than earned change. Embodied emotion is absent; all reactions are performed for an implied audience rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's interiority is ornamental rather than embodied—her ambition to "cultivate serenity within motion" is asserted repeatedly but never tested against competing impulses or forced choices. No internal contradiction appears; she plants, waits, and harvests without struggle, doubt, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The villagers serve as passive audience rather than applying pressure. Emotions are labeled ("her heart pulse in rhythm") instead of shown through specific, contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve the orchard is stated but never tested by genuine conflict or contradiction. Her actions—probe, lift, secure, release—read as smooth procedural steps without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The "realization" in paragraph 17 arrives as summary rather than dramatized discovery with cost. Internal experience remains at the surface; no contradictory impulses complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clearly stated—documenting wind patterns to find a convergence point—but her choices rarely show internal conflict or cost. The "hazy precision" and poetic observations remain surface-level; interiority is largely expository ("She believed," "She sensed") without embodied contradiction. The final "whisper into the wind" and the vortex's response feel conveniences rather than earned stakes that foreclose a path with visible cost. No secondary character appears to test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The bell ringer remains a purely ornamental figure executing a single descriptive act without on-page choice, contradiction, or cost. Interiority consists entirely of abstract declarations ("certify wonder as essential") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The synesthetic trait is label-only; no micro-choice arises from hearing colors as notes. No relationship crucible, no mistake, noflawed stance—only a tourist performing a ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. Her motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is told in conceptual language without micro-choices that reveal internal contradiction or cost. The ending gesture—walking to the cliff—reads as symbolic closure rather than a character-driven foreclosure with visible emotional price. No on-page struggle between competing impulses materializes during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains a cipher throughout—her "borrowed personalities" are asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical claims ("she believed the mathematics of emotion") without embodied emotion or a single concrete decision that reveals hierarchy of values. No internal conflict appears; she moves through the night in unbroken certainty. The final collection of shards reads as an action without cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The courier remains jittery throughout without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his motivation to spread wonder is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost. The shepherd and girl receive wonder passively with no agency that pressures the courier's choices. The absent mentor functions as thematic decoration rather than a constraint that forces a difficult trade-off. Interior voice relies on stock phrasing ("tiny miracle," "spark of wonder") and the final triumph arrives without visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("firmly grounded in the ancient rituals…yet her mind hovered between reverence and restless curiosity") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The prism communion sequence describes emotional transfer but never shows Liora's internal cost or struggle—grief is felt passively rather than forcing a decision that forecloses a path. Her vow to "share the prism's story" at the end arrives as summary rather than earned choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interiority remains abstract throughout—"latent sacrifice settle in her bones" and "wistful" are labels rather than embodied contradictions. The protagonist executes a predetermined ritual (place puzzle pieces, set bead on pedestal) without meaningful internal conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final "understanding" that her sacrifice became the warp arrives as an assertion rather than emerging from prior on-page struggle. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears; the amber dims but Mara walks away intact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    The blacksmith remains a cipher throughout, defined by abstract labels ("meek," "quietly determined") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His choice to seek the silk and his final forging read as plot stations, not decisions emerging from internal conflict. The memory he "barters" is told in summary ("the memory of his first failed forge, a scar he kept hidden beneath soot") without embodied cost or visible friction. The villagers appear only to receive exposition in the final third, and no relationship pressure tests the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's sensory-mapper profession is label-only; her interior voice is identical to the narrator's elevated register without distinct perceptual bias. The motivation to "discover the weight of a withheld truth" never generates on-page conflict between competing impulses—she moves from setup to revelation without hesitation or cost. The climactic choice (raising the shard to awaken the crew) reads as a smooth epiphany rather than a decision forced by contradictory wants, and the ending grants her "lightness of shared knowledge" without dramatizing what she forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marek's interiority leans heavily on ambient observation ("warmly observant," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His ritual is described at length but no competing impulse disrupts it; the stacking proceeds unopposed, flattening tension. The final return—"He returned, his heart alight"—asserts change without dramatizing the cost that earned it. Motivations remain abstract ("protect this fragile chain") and are never tested by a credible threat or internal dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira remains abstract despite her centuries-old backstory claim; no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion appear in scene. The storm herald is a cipher whose laughter is asserted but never dramatized through micro-choices. Both characters operate as symbols executing ritual steps rather than individuals under pressure, and the final vow "I will guide the dawn" reads as a label rather than an earned stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.2)
    Lira remains a cipher throughout—her "watchful nature" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The donor heart pulses with symbolic significance but never constrains or costs her anything; she gains insight without struggle. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("her motivation was simple yet profound") rather than embodied thought under pressure. No meaningful change is earned; she begins capable and ends capable, sealing a "pact" that costs nothing visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eli's interior is paint-by-numbers: "quantified sorrow," "scattered dreams," and "what trees witness" remain label-only abstractions never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure. His motivation to discover arboreal memory is told twice but never forces a trade-off or complicates the work. Emotional progression is decorative—"sorrow in his chest ease"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile and "quiet testament" land as stock epiphany rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.2)
    Lira is introduced as a "scattered memory keeper" but this trait never constrains a choice or creates internal conflict on the page. Her actions—singing, raising arms, whispering—read as ritual gestures without embodied contradiction or cost. The "bound release of centuries of restraint" is asserted rather than earned through prior struggle. Secondary characters (wandering spirits, visitors) are ornamental; they gather and observe but apply no pressure that alters Lira's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    The recluse's motivation to "unearth wisdom in a mistake" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. His decision to enter the library lacks visible cost or competing desires; he simply paces and then descends without friction. The curator interaction and mirror epiphany read as therapy-speak ("to hide it was to deny the very heart that sought love") rather than earned insight through dramatized struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels—"compassionate," "keenly empathetic"—without showing these traits constrain choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by abstractions—"creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution"—rather than concrete wants or contradictory impulses under pressure. No embodied emotion or micro-choices appear; the character observes and meditates but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The empty-chair gesture and whispered thanks are performed rituals, not choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of label-heavy reflection without the texture of a distinct mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chief is characterized primarily through labels ("gently meticulous") and stock behaviors (noting frequencies "with the precision of a surgeon") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation linking the archive work to "forgotten syllables of her own childhood" arrives as assertion without on-page dramatization of how that memory constrains present choices. The final act—whispering a vow about memory outlasting oblivion—reads as thematic statement rather than a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority operates as elevated summary.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lila's motivation—"to capture the sound of trust breaking"—reads as abstract poeticism rather than a concrete goal that drives visible choices under pressure. Her physical actions (decoy vial, rope trick) are legible, but interior contradiction is absent; she moves through the scene with uniform resolve despite the "comforting unease" label. The watch fob appears repeatedly but remains inert—warm, cold, ticking—without altering her stance or forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied emotion is thin: "comforting unease" is asserted, not shown through contradictory impulses or degraded perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arin's motivation is stated early but never tested by a concrete choice under pressure. His "luminous skeptic" nature and "faint awe" are labels without embodied contradiction or cost—he observes the weather carriers and records data, but no decision forecloses a path or reveals competing values. The interiority consists largely of atmospheric perception ("tasting the air," "metallic tang") without internal conflict driving action. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost emerges by the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's motivations are declared—"suppressed creativity," "fractured inspiration"—but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The painting sequence shows goal pursuit, but the lock opening via mirror-reflection feels more symbolic convenience than earned character choice. Her mnemonic gift is mentioned but never constrains a decision or creates a visible tradeoff. The guardian's wordless urging and the vial's flood of creativity read as external rescue rather than protagonist agency with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    The calligrapher remains a type rather than a character—no contradictory impulses, no genuine struggle visible in her choices. The journey from workshop to cavern to vent unfolds as smooth discovery with no embodied cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Her refusal of the council proclamation is told in summary ("That night she retrieved...") rather than dramatized with felt consequence. The final moment offers no earned change; she simply documents what happened, trading agency for passive witness.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.2)
    The bell tuner remains a static figure whose interiority is never dramatized; we see no internal conflict, no micro-choices under pressure, only declarative statements about his motivation. The piece tells us he "discovered a method" and "works after words become unnecessary" without showing the struggle, doubt, or cost of those choices. Emotional states are labeled rather than embodied—"smiles," "feeling the muted vigor"—without contradictory impulses or lived tension. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost occurs; the protagonist ends exactly as he began, tending his sculpture in an unchanging routine.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.2)
    Vira's motivation—"inner static"—reads as therapeutic abstraction rather than embodied desire. Her choices feel mechanically aligned to prompt elements rather than arising from contradictory impulses; she approaches the box, whispers code, activates systems without visible internal friction or cost. The "nostalgic android" trait remains a label; no specific memory or contradiction shapes her actions under pressure. The ending smile is tagged as "a fleeting glitch in her programming, yet it felt genuine"—tell-only interiority that undermines embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation ("to prove that listening heals") is declared but never tested against a competing want or fear; she moves through the story without internal contradiction or difficult trade-offs. The locket's revelation and the boy's final request unfold without visible cost to her—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the narrative pulse of the neighborhood") rather than embodied sensation. Supporting characters (storyteller, child) apply no pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    Selene remains a lyrical gesture throughout rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her actions—twirling, singing, dancing—are described but never reveal interior conflict or cost that would make them choices under pressure. The story tells us she feels "calm defiance" and that "encrypting vulnerability as strength was a pact with herself," but these are asserted labels rather than embodied decisions that foreclose options. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values; she moves through the lab unopposed by doubt or competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interiority remains abstract and declarative throughout. Her stated haunting question ("where do deleted memories go") never generates a micro-choice under pressure; she simply performs ritualistic actions (brewing coffee, pressing flowers) without internal contradiction or embodied hesitation. The final "understanding" arrives as unearned epiphany—label-only realization without struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; she gathers fragments, smiles, and walks away satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.2)
    The summoner remains entirely opaque—no interiority, contradiction, or embodied emotion. Her actions (kneeling, whispering, walking) are gestures without motive friction or cost; we never see her weigh options or struggle. The "tranquil blaze of purpose" is a label, not a dramatized state. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she completes her ritual smoothly and disappears, leaving no visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to learn the language of old buildings remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent—the narrator moves smoothly from curiosity to "clarity" without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The tutor Liora functions as a guide-figure rather than applying immediate pressure relevant to conflict. The final "feeling both humbled and newly fluent" reads as unearned epiphany, not supported by visible struggle or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira remains an abstract vessel throughout; her "charmed skeptic" identity is told but never tested through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The transformation from isolation to independence is asserted via strings of poetic labels ("ghostly resolve," "tragically radiant") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of thematic declarations and metaphoric states that float above concrete sensory grounding. The ending grants her a completed arc without visible cost or foreclosed options—she simply walks away carrying wisdom the text declares rather than earns through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora's motivation to "forgive the unfinished" remains abstract throughout; no on-page contradiction or struggle tests this desire against a competing impulse. Her actions—tracing verses, placing the key—read as ceremonial gestures without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. Interior experience consists largely of label-only feelings ("quietly shining resolve," "wisely enduring calm") rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final smile and bow offer no evidence that renunciation or stance crystallization altered her available options.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The canyon echo singer remains label-only throughout; her "richly perceptive" trait is asserted rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to learn why people echo is declared but never tested by competing desires or genuine obstacle—she simply walks, sings, places the shell, and receives answers without internal conflict or visible cost. The final "promise to carry this knowledge outward" reads as an add-on rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Interiority consists of stock phrasing ("quiet ache," "peace as gentle as a reed's sigh") without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    The whisperer remains an abstract agent who observes and records but never faces a genuine internal contradiction or makes a choice with visible tradeoff. Her "purpose" is declared singular yet she never struggles against competing impulses or temptations that would test commitment. Interiority consists of stock mystical phrasing—"weave truth carefully," "threading each revelation like ice filaments"—that sounds like a prompt echo rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to "guide those shards back" arrives without prior resistance or cost, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philosopher's motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Interiority relies heavily on abstract assertions ("felt the weight of routine settle") and therapeutic language ("revealed the hidden patterns he sought") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist observes and resolves to mend memory, but no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost. The character functions as a vehicle for theme rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's core trait—"sharply observant"—is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The interiority relies on stock philosophical phrasing ("the weight of her responsibility," "exhilaration of having turned myth into measurable reality") rather than character-particular perception. Her decision-making proceeds in a straight line without internal conflict; the diamond's discovery and the stillpoint revelation feel automatic rather than earned through flawed struggle. No visible cost or trade-off accompanies her triumph, reducing the final choice to a declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The "lonely visionary" remains abstract and label-driven throughout, never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under genuine pressure. Interiority consists of grandiose declarations ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") without internal conflict or embodied emotion. The character observes, arranges mirrors, and commissions drones but no decision forecloses a path with visible cost; the ending grants success without struggle. Selene exists only as radio static, never pressuring the protagonist's choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    The poet remains largely static, moving through wistful observation without internal contradiction or difficult choice. His mission is declared ("translator between generations") rather than earned through pressure, and the glass-jar method emerges fully formed without struggle or cost. The child's appearance feels convenient rather than causally prepared, and the poet's arc from lonesome to redeemed reads as summary rather than dramatized transformation. Embodied emotion is sparse; labels like "positively wistful" and "redemption gleaned" replace concrete, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "logically emotional mind" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her interior life remains abstract—"analytical and poetic," "numbers as much as...music"—without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final tear is a label-only acknowledgment of beauty, not a choice with cost. No genuine struggle or blind spot complicates her competence; she succeeds without foreclosing a path or paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara exists as a label ("vigilant horizon mapper") rather than a person making contradictory choices under pressure. Her internal experience is almost entirely abstract—"sculpt patience from impatience," "unyoke the rush"—without embodied emotion or lived contradiction. The final "unyoke" moment declares release rather than dramatizing a foreclosed path with visible cost. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the piece summarizes her transformation rather than showing her struggle through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interiority is present but largely consists of abstract emotional claims ("fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The pivot at the rusted valve—deciding to redirect the water—feels unmotivated by prior struggle; we see her record data and trace a pipe, but no trade-off or genuine internal conflict that would make this choice costly. The mentor's warning about data and fear is told rather than dramatized, and Mara's emotions are summarized in therapy-adjacent language ("fortified vulnerability," "controlling influence") without embodied sensation or credible irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chaplain's interiority leans heavily on abstract religious language ("moral weight," "rhythm of redemption") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to repair the heart proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost—he moves from curiosity to action via reflection rather than pressure. The shopkeeper remains a functional facilitator with no distinct want or obstacle. Motivation is declared ("turn apology into action") but the apology itself and the specific wrong remain vague, undercutting the stakes of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is defined almost entirely through label ("steadily curious," "mischievous wonder") and algorithmic metaphor rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The yearning algorithm stands in for her own interiority, flattening her agency into ornamental description. The joke to the gears reads as whimsy without cost, and no meaningful internal conflict surfaces—she executes a plan without friction or trade-off. The final laugh feels declared rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lia's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks deleted files as archival memory—but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The piece tells us she "felt a surge of purpose" and "smiled" rather than embodying contradictory impulses or showing micro-choices under pressure. The final discovery lands without visible cost; she simply logs the data and vows to guard the archive, a tidy resolution that avoids genuine renunciation or trade-off. "Brightly attentive" appears as a descriptor without constraining a single choice or mistake on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.2)
    The peacekeeper remains a label rather than a character with embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is abstract ("calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced") without concrete sensory detail or competing impulses.

Emotional progression is flat; the protagonist moves through beats without visible struggle or transformation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's interior is thick with abstract reflection ("fold in patience," "grip on reality loosely") but motivations remain opaque—why this marina, why now, what concrete choice hangs in the balance? The "euthanasia tourist" label floats as concept rather than lived contradiction; no on-page decision forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin; most interiority reads as poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The volunteers remain scenery rather than pressure; the ending whispers gratitude without dramatizing what was renounced or gained.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    The sentinel's motivation to "nurture intersubjective understanding" between ghosts and soil reads as abstract label-speak rather than embodied want. No contradictory impulses act in scene; the character operates in solitary communion with vines, so relationship and status bullets cannot apply. The ending declares he "finally felt whole" without a prior on-page struggle between competing desires or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority consists of elevated philosophical abstractions ("passionate subtlety," "gently persuasive") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The Keeper is defined almost entirely through abstract labels ("strangely honest," "whisperfield calm") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation to preserve wisdom is told rather than dramatized through concrete choice under pressure. The prophet and villagers remain stock figures without individual traits or dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is labeled "perceptively calm" and assigned a mission but never faces a single on-page choice that costs her anything or forces contradictory impulses. Her interiority consists of generic assertions ("She whispered to the air, 'We will transmute pain into a masterpiece'") rather than embodied emotion or micro-decisions under pressure. The villagers arrive as a static chorus with no distinct voices or resistance; no relationship on the page applies pressure. The work reads as a tableau of archival activity, not a character making choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The "weathered innocence" and "reticent" traits remain labels without embodied choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her actions (placing notebook, recording echoes, leaving a folded page) never force a trade-off or foreclose a path with visible cost. The final "smile" and "melting reticence" read as unearned transformation without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is given a consistent trait ("precognitively forgetful") but it remains largely decorative, mentioned rather than constraining choices. His quest to find chalk and inscribe aging operates as a series of atmospheric actions without visible internal contradiction or cost-laden micro-decisions. The ending gesture—spreading chalk dust and smiling—reads as satisfaction without foreclosing a meaningful path or embodying a trade-off scaled to the journey. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("tide of longing," "echoes of his past selves") rather than embodied, character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    The sage camera repairer remains externalized throughout; his "purpose clarified" and "changelessly constant" hands are label-only traits without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of abstract meditation ("luminous ache," "ephemeral pulse") rather than character-particular perception under stress. No meaningful internal conflict shapes the repair sequence—he moves through steps with competent certainty, never facing a genuine mistake or trade-off that would demonstrate flawed judgment scaled to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mara remains a serene vessel throughout with no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; her "decisively kind grace" and "quiet duty" are asserted labels rather than embodied choices under pressure. The story declares her gratitude-sensing and hymn-perfecting without showing internal conflict or a hierarchy of competing values. Mr. Harlan and the staff are props without distinct interiority, and the final gesture—stepping onto the balcony—carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. Diagnostic label-speak ("decisively kind," "pulsing stillness") and therapy-register phrasing flatten what should be peak emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira's motivation is stated early but remains abstract—she wants to "find where shadows go at noon," yet this goal never generates on-page friction or contradictory impulses. Her actions are quietly deliberate throughout, but no micro-choice reveals competing values or costs; she simply executes a plan without visible struggle. The final realization that shadows travel to the isle's core feels like an informational payoff rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on declarative summary ("she realized," "she believed") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is labeled a "forgiving skeptic" with "shrewdly innocent eyes," but these attributes function as decorative tags rather than drivers of contradictory impulses in scene. Her interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophizing ("mistakes are stars," "dark matter binds the universe") delivered in elevated register that flattens urgency. The bone-setting action feels procedural rather than revealing character under pressure—no genuine struggle, blind spots, or embodied emotion complicates the repair. The ending grants her a "quiet triumph" without visible cost or foreclosed path, failing the Earned Stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    The star watcher remains a static archetype performing ritual gestures without internal contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("Her heart housed a pearl of stillness") rather than embodied emotion or competing impulses.

The final "smile at the stillness she had forged" is told satisfaction without dramatized struggle or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation to transform grief is signaled early, but her interior life remains abstract—"protected vulnerability" and "honeyed hush" function as thematic labels rather than embodied contradiction. The sister's viral confession is told rather than dramatized, so Lira's response lacks friction or visible cost in scene. Micro-choices (placing stones, touching the interface) exist but feel ornamental rather than pressure-tested; no competing impulse acts against her in the moment. The final smile is asserted satisfaction without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    The novelist remains largely abstract—an observer whose "conflicted" nature is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("doubt gnawed," "heart waiting") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The protagonist moves through the nexus gathering hopes but never makes a micro-choice with visible cost that reveals a hierarchy of values. Agency is passive observation; the final act of placing the fragment and closing the notebook feels ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation to restore sacred practices is declared but never tested by meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She moves through the ritual without hesitation, doubt, or cost—her "gentle sigh" and whispered promise read as performed emotion rather than embodied struggle.

The ending's promise to "guard these practices" and teach children arrives without foreclosing any live option or showing what she sacrificed to gain this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    The alchemist remains an abstraction throughout; her actions are described but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously, and choices do not foreclose paths with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on stock poetic phrasing ("pulse of a heart," "cartography of love and loss") rather than character-particular perception. The ending promise to return each season reads as declaration without dramatized struggle or renunciation that would earn stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.2)
    Corin's motivation to "store wonder" remains abstract and decorative throughout; no contradictory impulses act in scene, only serene problem-solving. The "reflective locksmith" trait functions as a label rather than a constraint that forces tradeoffs. Interiority relies on elevated philosophical phrasing ("the paradox of capturing something as fleeting as an echo") rather than embodied stress or micro-choices with visible cost. The ending posits triumph without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.2)
    The fractal weaver remains abstract throughout—no embodied contradiction, no micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing values. Her purpose is declared ("to collect the weights of different burdens") but never tested by a moment where collection costs her something or forces a trade-off. The final smile and departure read as serene completion rather than earned endurance or renunciation with visible cost. Interiority consists of poetic sensation ("feeling the boundary-lessly trapped currents of grief loosen") without the grit of decision-making that would ground agency.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation ("harvest lessons from loss") is stated rather than discovered through contradictory impulses. The carving process itself lacks embodied struggle—she simply "began to carve" with no physical resistance, no competing desires pulling her away from or toward completion. The widow role and circus background remain labels; no micro-choice reveals how her tamer's training shapes her hands or perception under this particular grief. The closure renunciation (placing the lantern, understanding the paradox) arrives without visible cost that forecloses a live alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final exchange with the ghost reads as conceptual negotiation without grounded emotional cost or visible micro-choices that foreclose options. Tears at the end are asserted rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses. The ghost remains allegorical convenience rather than a pressure that forces Mara into genuine tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The intern operates as a vehicle for concept demonstration rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "functionally creative" mind and "stoic wonder" are asserted labels that never create friction or cost in her choices—she encounters no resistance, makes no mistakes, experiences no doubt. The sextant alignment, power rerouting, and equation-drafting succeed without struggle, rendering her competent to the point of implausibility. Interiority consists of elevated abstraction ("maze of intentions," "ethical currents") rather than embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains passive throughout, with no contradictory impulses or earned choices under pressure. His "making peace" with the dream is told through abstract declarations ("I will keep you") rather than dramatized through competing wants or visible tradeoffs.

    The protagonist remains abstract—an "errant legend seeker" who performs symbolic gestures (raising a sundial, whispering to air) without embodied contradiction or mistake. Interiority consists of thematic declarations ("he felt a surge of purpose," "he realized that hindsight clarity") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with felt cost; the lock opens, the lies unravel, and he glides forward unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The seed collector remains a static figure whose "infinite patience" is asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. No meaningful internal conflict appears—he kneels, decodes, whispers thanks, and waits without any visible cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prince remains an abstract figure whose motivations are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. His transformation from "bedraggled" to "radiant" is asserted in summary without earned causality or visible internal conflict. The piece relies on label-only interiority ("his heart beat for something softer") and stock epiphany language ("felt his own flaw melt away") that never dramatizes the cost of change. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; the protagonist drifts through events rather than driving them.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's firefighter identity is asserted repeatedly but never tested by on-page action—she performs no rescue, extinguishes no fire, makes no tactical choice under pressure. Her "unyielding compassion" remains a label rather than an embodied trait that constrains decisions. The coin-and-thread ritual unfolds without friction or visible cost; the villagers' gratitude arrives unearned, summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is introduced with evocative labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") but these never constrain choices or generate internal conflict on the page. Her actions follow a linear quest without hesitation, doubt, or competing impulses—she simply performs each step the story requires.

No embodied emotion or contradictory impulse acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eliam's role as carver is richly drawn through sensory-specific gestures ("hands shivered stone"), but his journey from observation to action lacks on-page contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.

The ending declares understanding ("he understood that the shape of collective grief was not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry") without showing a visible choice or forfeiture that closes a live path.

Embodied emotion is absent; we're told she "felt the weight of centuries lift" rather than shown bodily reaction under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation forecloses a path with cost; the ending declares success without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    The gardener's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" remains abstract and unanchored in embodied contradiction. His actions—humming, placing the case, unfolding the tapestry—proceed without visible internal friction or cost. The Marlowe backstory (hidden map, misread cowardice) is told rather than earned through present choice, and the epiphany that "intention is a shape, a circle" arrives as assertion rather than dramatized struggle. No meaningful trade-off or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.2)
    The ignorance cartographer operates at pure abstraction without interiority, embodied emotion, or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation ("to teach dust to tell stories") remains abstractly stated rather than enacted through concrete choices under pressure. Her actions—transcribing, adjusting the dial—feel observational and procedural rather than driven by contradictory impulses or visible internal conflict. The closing pride is asserted, not earned through a dramatized forfeiture or stance crystallization. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we see gestures (wrapping the shawl) but no contradictory physical states that reveal character under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exists only as a cipher for symbolic actions—no interiority, no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses that drive choice under pressure. Her "purpose" is declared ("to crystallize a fleeting emotion") but never dramatized through micro-choices or felt cost; she performs ritual gestures without internal conflict or visible stakes. The mask, powder, and whispered incantations remain ornamental stage business rather than choices that foreclose options. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she exits unchanged, making the entire sequence a static performance rather than a character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is present and sustained, but reads as abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist agonizes over competing narratives in label-only fashion ("I agonize over which tale to champion") without dramatized internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance ("agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful than nurturing a chorus of truths") arrives as stated epiphany rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Embodiment is limited; reactions to the cog and sediment remain cerebral rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    The harmonious choir teacher lacks interiority and micro-choices under pressure; she remains a vessel for the prompt rather than a complex agent. Her "expectantly resigned" state is declared but never shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The townspeople are sketch figures carrying "old grudges like heavy books," a label without dramatized friction or embodied emotion. The ending declares transformation ("faces transform," "hatred…rusting away") rather than earning it through specific, conflicted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation is declared ("create something beautiful from the ruins") but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost. Her interior life consists of poetic sensory cataloging rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's trait of involuntary truthfulness is labeled but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost on the page. Her motivation to preserve wonder is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses; she simply enacts it without friction. The drone and matchbox function as plot devices that Mara observes and activates, but no internal conflict forces her to choose between competing desires. The confessional quality attributed to her bell-ringing never dramatizes a moment where truth-telling forecloses an option or charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrator remains passive throughout, observing rather than making choices under pressure. Interiority consists largely of abstract aesthetic claims ("inadvertently profound," "hushed blaze") without embodied emotion or contradiction. The single micro-choice—buying the shard—lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The ending declares sanctification and alignment but never dramatizes the weight of silence or any genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    The living statue lacks genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Its telepathic "incisively kind" nature is asserted rather than embodied through difficult micro-choices under pressure.

No meaningful change is earned; the statue simply executes its pre-existing nature without visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aric is present throughout and his "grim optimist" stance is stated, but his choices are largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene.

Motivation is declared ("to capture the texture of a missed opportunity") but not tested by on-page pressure that forces a visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is heavily ornamental—"methodically hopeful" and "quiet promise" function as labels rather than contradictory impulses enacted in scene. No meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion under pressure; she paints, pauses, watches, repeats without friction. Jiro's brief appearance introduces a second character whose memory is told rather than dramatized, and his moment of remembering is abstract ("felt the brush's whisper") rather than grounded in specific embodied choice. The final stance (Mara turning to a new canvas) reads as static routine rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost.

    Liora's motivation to rescue dying arts remains abstract throughout; we see her perform tour-guide actions and revive a baking custom, but no internal conflict or competing impulse surfaces to test her commitment. The piece tells us she "sensed a thaw" and "whispered to the crowd" yet never dramatizes a moment where her own doubt, fear, or cost pressures a choice. Secondary characters (mute potter, young calligrapher, unnamed artisans) exist as passive recipients rather than sources of friction. Emotional states are labeled ("rosewater dread," "honeyed sorrow") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.2)
    The clock maker remains entirely abstract—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no genuine struggle. We see him "feel the bleak exhilaration" and achieve his goal, but interiority is label-only ("restless heart," "seized control") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The resolution feels declared rather than earned through prior causality; he simply succeeds at every step without visible cost or internal friction. Therapy-speak ("restless heart," "step beyond fate's design") and diagnostic self-awareness flatten what should be visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; her swallowing of the clasp and final "vanish" command feel unmotivated by prior interiority. The whispering advisor remains a flat device without goals or pressure. Embodied emotion is largely absent—"trembling hand" and "flickering eyes" are stock gestures, and the piece relies on atmospheric labels ("terror," "dread") rather than concrete perception under stress. The ending choice lacks earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prophet remains entirely abstract—no bodily sensation, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of declarative exposition ("His gift was to interpret cloud movements") without embodied emotion or conflict. The "motivation was simple yet profound" sentence is pure telling; the character performs actions but never wrestles with competing wants or fears. No earned change or renunciation with visible cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her "quiet resolve" functions as a label; we never see her waver, doubt, or pay an internal price for her choices. The shift from "questioning the watchers" to "carrying the pattern forward" is asserted in summary rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict. Micro-choices exist (tracing ink, blowing the whistle) but they advance plot without revealing competing desires or visible cost that would foreclose alternate paths.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arlen Voss is characterized almost entirely through exposition and abstract qualities ("emotionally rational," "fictional historian"). The protagonist performs no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; he simply moves through the station and reads a letter that confirms his prior beliefs. The "emotionally rational" attribute remains a label without embodiment; at no point does this trait constrain a choice or create visible cost. The final gesture—placing the letter on a pedestal and whispering to empty tracks—reads as symbolic performance rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear—cataloging abandoned structures—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, label-like phrasing ("stoically sensitive," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than embodied contradiction. The core action of placing notes lacks on-page cost or friction; she completes her task without struggle, renunciation, or meaningful choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin: "her heart hammered like a drum, yet her face remained a mask of calm calculation" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final vow to return reads as continuation rather than transformation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear but her interiority reads generic and label-heavy ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve"). Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through tasks with methodical calm that never fractures under the scale of discovery she claims to experience. The final vault revelation and council presentation feel like competent execution rather than choices that cost her something or foreclose a live path. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under genuine pressure are missing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    The lantern maker's motivation to transform grief into origami cranes is established, but his interior life remains abstract and declarative ("His motivation is simple yet terrible"). Emotions are labeled rather than embodied—"luminous torment" appears repeatedly as a phrase rather than enacted through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist performs ritualized actions without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses options; the process reads as accomplished rather than fraught, and the final "paradoxical peace" arrives unearned by prior dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's grief-to-awakening arc is signaled but remains largely abstract. His interior life relies heavily on stock metaphors ("grief was a fuel he could not extinguish") and the final shift to "fierce, exhilarating clarity" lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The character observes and performs ritualized actions—calibrating, thrusting his palm—but these feel more like stage business than decisions that narrow options with visible cost. Motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's interiority is nearly absent—she registers "thrill" and "perpetually surprised joy" in label-only fashion without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The pilgrim remains a cipher, present only to murmur verses and smile. Internal conflict is non-existent; every action flows smoothly toward the predetermined harmonious outcome without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "vow to guard the chip" arrives unearned, a declaration rather than a choice forced by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    The genealogist's guilt and internal contradiction are established early, and the closing act of setting down the watch hand with a promise of honest dealing attempts a change. However, the protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("tempered regret," "weight of a withheld truth") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The turn from guilt to redemption is asserted more than earned through visible cost or foreclosed paths; the final micro-choice (setting down the watch) lacks the pressure that would make the renunciation feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.2)
    The negotiator remains abstract throughout; we receive label-only interiority ("uncommonly thoughtful," "furrowed hush") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The scarred veteran functions only as a mirror; no relationship pressure emerges. Past error is summarized in one sentence without shaping present tactics or revealing character-specific limits.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains a passive vessel for poetic abstraction rather than a character making contradictory choices under pressure. Interior life consists entirely of therapy-speak ("backlash of regrets," "align heart and action") and summary reflection with no embodied micro-decisions that test values. The night betrayal and crew abandonment are told in a single summary sentence without dramatized cost that shapes present action. No visible choice forecloses a path; the kayak launch proceeds frictionlessly from melancholy to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "kindle empathy" is told rather than embodied in contradictory action. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("the weight of its sorrow," "clean slate was not blank but rewritten") rather than concrete, character-particular thought. The internal arc from dirty past to empathy-seeker proceeds without visible friction or cost—no moment dramatizes the protagonist resisting or paying for this shift. The final choice to toss the baseball feels symbolic rather than motivated by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora's motivation is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict. The "reluctant metamorphosis" is told as fear without embodied cost or genuine stakes that force a difficult choice.

Interiority consists largely of abstract yearning ("cosmic intimacy," "infinite embrace") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cartomancer remains abstract throughout—no embodied contradiction, no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. "Willingly perplexed" is asserted but never dramatized through a moment where incompatible impulses collide. The twins are passive recipients; the protagonist performs ritual gestures (kneel, whisper, unfasten) without internal friction or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock mystical phrasing ("velvet," "choking beauty") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    Nara's interiority is abstract and label-driven throughout ("ghostly resolve," "shadow work," "hidden grief") rather than embodied. No micro-choices under pressure reveal competing impulses; she drifts through actions without visible internal friction.

Her pacifist stance is named but never tested by a concrete dilemma that would make the cost visible.

    Mara is built from labels rather than contradictory impulses: "destitute philanthropist," "believing orchestrated coincidences," seeking to "understand the texture of transformation." Her motivation to capture fireflies is asserted but never tested by a trade-off or visible cost. The fisherman arrives as a plot convenience and shares the same interpretive vocabulary, flattening any status dynamic. Her "understanding" at the end is told epiphany without dramatized struggle or forecloses path.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.2)
    Kael remains a cipher throughout—his "calmly inventive" trait is asserted but never tested by contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The supposed revolution unfolds without on-page resistance, doubt, or visible cost to his person or relationships; guards simply "begin to question orders" in summary after the device activates. Interior life consists of stock phrases ("curiosity turned into quiet intrigue") rather than embodied contradiction. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.2)
    Selene remains abstract throughout—her "elusive eel herder" label never translates into embodied action or occupational detail that shapes a choice. The precognitive curse is declared but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; it functions as exposition rather than lived constraint. The final "smile" and trust in the future she "could now help shape" reads as convenience resolution without visible cost or trade-off. Interiority consists largely of thematic summary ("she believed the dust held the key") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet's interiority reads as abstract philosophical musing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Motivation remains declarative ("furiously tranquil," "vigil in pause") without grounding in micro-choices that reveal competing impulses.

No secondary character pressure; the poet performs his ritual unopposed, flattening stakes into contemplative tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.2)
    The philosopher and diplomat remain abstract constructs rather than individuals with contradictory interior impulses. The mechanical arm is described but never constrains a choice with embodied cost; "diplomatically fierce" stays label-only.

No meaningful change or renunciation is earned through dramatized pressure.

    Lira's personality-molting trait is declared but never shown constraining a choice or creating visible cost on the page. The partnership with Rook is asserted through summary ("their friendship sparked") rather than dramatized through embodied interaction.

The final stance—"We have rebuilt a garden in stone"—arrives as statement rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.2)

No micro-choices under pressure; he moves through metaphorical space without genuine friction or visible cost. The "unplanned encore" motivation is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. Interior life is generic poetic summary rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear, but her interiority reads as abstract catalog rather than embodied contradiction—she "possessed an empirically whimsical mind that catalogued dreams as if they were weather charts" labels rather than dramatizes. The translation task (jade vine → tributaries, orchid pulse → festivals) arrives as summary exposition without visible struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The seed's awakening feels declared by incantation rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional progression remains smooth and illustrative; no genuine flaws complicate her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tutor's motivation is present but his agency never crystallizes into a genuine choice with trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation—to pivot from grand cosmic events to quiet, empirical humility—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized in how she treats the greenhouse as “a quiet laboratory.” Her past as a neutron star researcher meaningfully colors her perceptions and choices without turning into info-dump. The shift from chasing supernovas to “tending to garden ghosts” reads as a credible internal change with emotional texture, though true contradiction or sharp internal conflict under pressure is relatively soft. The final whisper to the vines earns her arc but at low-stakes intensity, keeping this short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elya’s motivation (rebuild her art and self after the fire) is clear and consistent, and her choices do drive the story. However, her interiority is largely thematic and generalized—there’s little felt contradiction, fear, or bitterness on the page given the extremity of the inciting event. The journey to the mine unfolds with almost no emotional or tactical struggle, so her final sense of purpose feels somewhat pre-declared rather than hard-won. The result is sympathetic but emotionally safe characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s trauma, tactile relationship to tools, and vow to “rectify the silence” give her clear, particular motivation, and her embodied reactions (scarf, scars, rope-calloused hands) feel lived-in. However, her inner life trends more declarative than conflicted—she moves fairly smoothly from intention to fulfillment without much simultaneous push–pull on the page. The realization about needing “the willingness to hear the quiet places” reads plausible but a bit neat. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, with limited dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlow’s vocation, weariness, and quiet devotion come through clearly, and his motive—to give the dead rest—feels grounded in his undertaker identity. However, his internal conflict stays mostly conceptual; we’re told he is “inadvertently stubborn,” but that stubbornness never forces a difficult, costly choice. Emotional embodiment is strong in images like “each breath a reminder that he, too, was a carrier of silence,” yet his feelings rarely complicate his actions. The final “merging” feels earned but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is clearly motivated by responsibility and solidarity, and her repeated small choices (ringing the bell nightly, organizing runs, teaching children) align with that. However, she faces little on-page opposition or true dilemma; we’re told the risk and weight more than we feel them through contradictory impulses or embodied stress. Her interiority is competent but somewhat generalized, with few idiosyncratic thoughts or moments of weakness. The final surge of hope is earned but comes without a visible personal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Milo’s motivation—to locate and free unused love—is clear and consistent with his “pilgrim of sparks” nature, and his actions follow logically from that drive. Interiority is mostly filtered through sensuous perception and spiritual focus, which feels particular rather than generic. What’s missing for a higher score is real contradiction or cost: he never wavers, doubts, or sacrifices anything tangible, so his “change” at the end feels more like confirmation than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s creative motivation is clear and specific—designing a maze that dissolves static perception—but we get little felt contradiction or risk beyond aesthetic and conceptual stakes. Her retrocognitive condition is intriguing yet mostly decorative, not dramatized as an active constraint on her choices. Interiority is lyrical but generalized; we rarely see Mara under genuine pressure choosing between competing values. The closing gratitude to the garden lands as earned but low-cost, more affirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied in her careful puzzle‑solving and reverent handling of the seeds, giving her a coherent, compelling throughline. However, her interiority remains largely one-note—pure resolve and nobility—without any felt contradiction, doubt, or selfish impulse under pressure. The “chained liberator” concept is potent but under-explored psychologically; the chains never create a real moral or emotional dilemma. Her final transformation (chains rusted loose, becoming a gardener) is thematically satisfying but somewhat too tidy given the lack of on-page internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation (to capture the sound of trust breaking via a hearing device) is clear and consistent, and her quiet reverence for the orchard reads as particular rather than generic awe. However, internal contradiction and on-page micro-conflict are minimal; she rarely struggles or wavers. Her final “change” feels more like a gentle affirmation of what she already believed than a costly shift. The interiority is evocative but emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s goal (steal the jar) and later reorientation toward preservation are clear and consistent, but her inner life remains archetypal rather than deeply particular. The “quietly savvy” thief rarely faces pressure that exposes contradiction or genuine struggle. Her final realization about her “true calling” feels a bit too smooth, with limited on-page cost or resistance. The conductor is more a function than a character, applying little relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation and temperament are clear and coherent—her blend of engineering seriousness and poetic ritual feels specific and lived-in. However, her internal conflict remains largely conceptual (“abandoning the illusion of control”) rather than dramatized in difficult, choice-laden moments. We don’t see a concrete temptation to prioritize speed, safety-theater, or despair that she must actively resist. The final “peace” is therefore affecting but a bit under-earned in terms of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s fear/bravado contradiction is clear and specific—“phobia‑ridden stunt double” who can still use a “stunt‑trained eye” gives her a distinct psychology. Her internal shift from masking fear to claiming it as power is coherent with earlier traits but comes very quickly, with little on-page resistance at the peak choice. Emotions are embodied at times (heart pounding, trembling), but often summarized in abstract language about betrayal and vulnerability. The final fearlessness feels slightly idealized, with limited sense of lingering cost or ongoing struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The oracle’s motivation—to chart an endless night and guide lost souls—is clear and consistent, and his choices (listening, mapping, sealing the map in his breath) align with that drive. However, his inner life stays largely in the register of vocation and mystic purpose, with little concrete contradiction or emotional friction. We don’t feel a strong clash between fear/faith, doubt/obsession, or personal cost beyond the abstract. The endurance at the end reads more like steady continuation than a pressured, transformative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    The robot’s curiosity is clearly motivated by the second chance program and the “curiosity module,” and its final reframing of cleaning as synthesis feels earned. However, it experiences very little real friction between duty and curiosity; its inner life is more declared than dramatized. There’s minimal sense of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, which keeps the change from feeling costly. The character reads as conceptually interesting but emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s role and motivation (to read the doodles, use the lens, and record the event rather than judge) are clear and consistent, but she rarely meets friction that forces revealing micro-choices. Her interiority is more conceptual than embodied; we’re told her peace and purpose rather than feeling them through contradictory impulses or concrete sensations. The “quiet night registrar” concept is strong, yet we never see her tempted to withhold or distort, so her final stance costs her little on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gardener’s core motive—proving the garden knows its keeper—is clear and consistently enacted through his ritual labor, but his interior conflict and ambivalence are only lightly sketched. We see little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine doubt; he feels more like an emblem than a fully individuated psyche. His “withered” state and “wisely pragmatic” label are gestured at but rarely tested under pressure. The final acceptance of “bloom and rot” lands, but without a sharply felt cost tied to a specific renunciation or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and specific, and her occupational lens (“sky mechanic”) colors how she engages with the station. However, her interiority remains relatively flat: we’re told her nature is “obliging” and that her motivation is “simple yet profound,” but we don’t see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. Her choice to pull the lever never feels difficult or costly; there’s no sense of fear, risk, or moral tension. The ending registers more as satisfied curiosity than an earned shift in her character.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to decipher the ghost’s code and free the trapped aria—is clear, consistent, and drives each choice, especially her decision to play the bridging note. Interiority is nicely embodied in how she reads the house and the water patterns, and she feels particular rather than generic. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction or visible cost; she rarely doubts, resists, or missteps. Her final change is more fulfillment than hard-won reconfiguration, so the emotional price remains relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mirela’s motivation—to quantify the “swallowed truth”—is clear and drives every action, and her embodied relationship to tools and environment feels specific. However, her inner conflict (guilt vs. clarity, doubt vs. need for certainty) remains mostly thematic rather than dramatized through competing impulses in discrete beats. The emotional cost of her lie is gestured at but not concretely rendered in memory or present-tense stakes, which keeps the final shift from feeling fully hard-won. The result is strong but a little too smooth for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s core motive and temperament (“reckless…religiously skeptical”) are clear and consistently dramatized through his methods of treating hauntings as data, not faith. However, his interior conflict remains relatively one-note: skepticism vs fascination never quite forces him into a painful contradiction, and his choice to leave the wheel, while plausible, doesn’t land with much individualized cost beyond a generalized “some truths are meant to haunt.” The emotional experience is described more atmospherically than in embodied, character-particular terms. Strong conceptual positioning, but not yet at a psychologically intricate level for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The keeper’s motivation (seeking regenerative silence/renewal) is clear and consistent, and his choices (following the swan, entering the refuge, writing the line) align with it. However, he lacks vivid internal contradiction; he feels more like an archetypal functionary than a fully individuated person. The final realization that his role is to witness rather than change largely restates what we’re told in the opening, so the arc feels more confirmed than transformed. Emotional experience is filtered through setting and concept rather than concrete, embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s vocation, temperament, and goal (“to nurture lifelong wonder”) are clear and consistently expressed through her choices—setting up the harp, placing the locket, modulating the music. The “cautious exuberance” gives her an internal flavor but doesn’t translate into a genuinely pressured or contradictory decision on the page. Emotional states are mostly labeled rather than dramatized through specific, conflicted behavior. The closure—her promise to carry this magic into every session—feels aligned with her existing self rather than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The historian’s motivation and professional obsession are clear, and his perceptions are filtered through that sensibility. However, he experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction; he glides through discovery rather than being tested by it. His emotional life is sketched more by atmosphere than by specific, embodied reaction in moments of pressure. The closing shift feels more like completion of a task than a costly personal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The writer has a clear, distinct role and motivation, but his inner life is mostly conveyed in abstract summary (“His motivation was simple yet profound”) rather than embodied, scene-level pressure. We rarely see contradictory impulses or a concrete cost to his choices; the revolution feels frictionless. His shift from accidental prophet to deliberate orchestrator is conceptually strong but not dramatized through specific, difficult micro-choices. Character reads more as an archetypal figure in a fable than as a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.6)
    The priest’s core motive (using indigo and sound to reveal hidden assumptions and protect the city) is clear and consistent, and his fear of being consumed by the possession adds some pressure. However, interiority is mostly conceptual rather than embodied—he “senses” and “knows” more than he feels in concrete, character-specific ways. Contradictory impulses (faith vs. self-preservation, doubt vs. certainty) are implied but never dramatized in a specific, situated reaction. His final stance feels thematically coherent but not paid for with a clearly felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lian’s longing and artistic ambition are clear and specific, and the fortune-writing / conducting fusion gives her a distinctive interior lens. However, she encounters almost no resistance; conflicting impulses (comfort of nostalgia vs. risk of transformation) are gestured at but never sharply dramatized. The emotional arc from “chronologically homesick” to “no longer a burden” feels more declared than earned by concrete struggle. Still, her actions (aligning the shell, inscribing fortunes, commanding “Conduct”) are coherent with her motives.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to conquer the “labyrinth of self” by embracing fractured timelines—is clear and consistent, but remains almost entirely at an abstract, thematic level. We rarely see contradictory impulses in action; his “choices” are mostly narrated as inevitabilities rather than dramatized micro-decisions under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin: the piece leans on grand conceptual language (“darkening brightness,” “periodically eternal”) instead of concrete, character-specific feeling. The closing acceptance of all his selves is intellectually foreshadowed but not emotionally earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marin’s goal—defeating emotional numbness—is clear and her actions track cleanly with that motive, but she encounters little genuine resistance or contradictory impulse. Her interiority leans on abstract labels (“emotional numbness,” “inner apathy”) more than idiosyncratic, embodied feeling. The deafness detail is evocative yet under-exploited psychologically; we rarely see how it complicates or colors her inner conflict in particularized ways. The final emotional change feels earned enough but somewhat tidy, with minimal sense of cost or lingering limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s vocation, ethical drive, and methodical temperament are clearly rendered, and her choice to use the shaft instead of breaking the quarantine is consistent and motivated. However, she faces little direct pressure, and we see almost no contradictory impulses—her integrity is asserted and affirmed rather than tested. Emotional states are often summarized (“layered tranquility,” “fragile hope”) instead of being sharply embodied under stress. The final realization that her meticulous nature is a compass feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Arlen’s grief and curiosity about scent-triggered tears are specific, consistent, and clearly motivate his choice to use the vial and then to commit to cataloging aromas. His interiority feels character-particular—lantern broker, son of a market-stall incense seller—rather than generic. However, his emotional shift from lifelong haunting question to “profound peace” and a mapped plan comes very smoothly, with limited on-page struggle or contradictory impulses in the decisive beat. The arc lands, but it feels slightly under-contested for the depth of the realization claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s core motive (“to discover the texture of time”) is clear and consistently expressed through his mapping and listening, and the final choice to bind the rope feels aligned with his established “ethically playful” stance. However, his inner life stays largely in the register of narrated abstraction rather than embodied contradiction; we’re told he treats choices like chess with the night, but we don’t feel real struggle or confusion in any single decision. The “impossible choices” tend to resolve without visible psychological cost, which softens the impact of the closing choice. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The violinist’s desire to “seek beauty in the unfinished world” is clear and consistent, and her role as ritual catalyst is well-defined. However, she experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction; her choices are aligned with the story’s needs but not pressured into complexity. Emotional states are largely implied through setting rather than embodied in specific sensations or micro-decisions. The final “smile” and walk away feel serene but low-cost, more affirmation than earned, conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is sharply etched as a competent, emotionally distanced specialist; her profession, methods, and outlook feel integrated and specific. The “affectionate detachment” toward emotions she commodifies is a strong, character-defining contradiction. However, she rarely experiences real friction between care and commerce in the moment, so her interior conflict remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The piece thus offers a vivid portrait but only a modest arc or pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is clear, specific, and consistent as a compassionate, shrewd broker whose choices drive the story (seeking the lighthouse keeper, creating the Compassion Register). However, her inner life is largely idealized; we get little contradiction or moral friction, and her “cautious exuberance” is stated more than dramatized. The lighthouse keeper remains more a figure than a pressured character. The final sense of change—renewed purpose—is credible but carries little felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen’s motivation (“to graft herself onto community”) is clear and consistently enacted through her choices to organize the search and dedicate the arbor, but she reads as serenely purposeful rather than pressured or internally conflicted. We rarely see contradictory impulses or specific embodied emotion; “boldly sympathetic” is more label than dramatized trait. Her relationship with the villagers is gestured at in collective terms, without a crucible dynamic with any one person. The closing realization with Lira is sweet but comes without much felt cost or struggle, which keeps the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific, and her choice to surrender the pendant gives her a legible before/after. However, her interiority stays relatively smooth—she rarely embodies contradictory impulses or real fear, even at the moment of sacrifice. The “natural history illustrator” detail is suggestive but underused to differentiate her psychology, beyond a brief sketching beat. The cost of losing the pendant is conceptually present but not emotionally worked through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conjurer has a clear, consistent motive and some embodied reaction (“pulse of hope rise beneath his ribs”), but his inner life remains largely stated rather than dramatized. We’re told he’s “gently inventive” and compassionate, yet he faces almost no resistance that would force contradictory impulses to surface. The final “insight” about loss as transformation feels a bit tidy because it isn’t hard-won against a live alternative choice. Stronger interior conflict or a visible price for his understanding would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s motivation (to cache lost knowledge and become visible to the needy) is clear and consistent, and her “kindly methodical” nature is lightly embodied in her measured actions. However, she encounters little credible resistance—internal or external—so we see more competence than genuine struggle. The realization that she can serve as a conduit for others’ grief is emotionally apt but arrives with minimal on-page ambivalence or cost. The arc feels complete but too frictionless for top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    Marlowe’s curiosity and quasi-spiritual respect for plant agency are clear and consistent, but he faces little genuine internal contradiction or emotional risk. His “circuitously sincere” nature is more told than dramatized in conflicting impulses or costly choices. The closing gratitude and vow “to keep releasing, to keep learning” feels thematically aligned but not hard-won. The piece reads more as a portrait of an already-wise practitioner than a character pressed into change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is vivid—a sleepless, grief-driven painter whose need to extract meaning from trauma is clear and consistent with her actions. However, her interior conflict at the key moment (trading away her paintings) is underdeveloped; she consents almost without hesitation or ambivalence. Emotions are well-evoked but lean toward summary (“Her motivation was simple and relentless”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The closing sense of “haggard awe” feels earned but could hit harder if the loss of her work were more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lira’s core motive (seeking the pearl to magnify everyday magic) is clear, and her final realization about the cave “inhabiting her destiny” offers a modest internal shift. However, interiority stays generalized and serene under all conditions, with little felt contradiction or stress on her clairvoyance, so she never feels fully particular or pressured. The pilgrim and child function more as emblems than as agents who complicate her choices. The change from threat to promise in “steady unpredictability” is thematically neat but emotionally under-earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist’s vocation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (when to sound the valve, what to collect, agreeing to depart) align with that core. However, he remains more emblematic than psychologically particular; we get little contradiction or messy inner conflict, especially around exile vs. return. Emotional states are mostly implied through action and metaphor rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic feeling. The closing decision to answer the distant shout feels entirely expected and largely untroubled by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Her core drive—to find the fortress of unspoken truths—is clear and consistent, and her cartographic vocation meaningfully colors perception and choices. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or hesitation; “the tremor of certainty” and its later steadiness read as a smooth curve rather than a struggle. The final commitment to serve as a conduit feels earned but not costly. Strong single-POV interiority, but thinner on genuine conflict or flawed impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s blend of skepticism and tenderness is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (offering tea to the wind, apologizing to the stars, choosing to preserve the tile as sanctuary) align with that nature. The internal arc from guarded skeptic to someone who accepts the tower as a shared reflective space feels earned, if gentle. However, internal conflict stays mostly conceptual (doubt vs wonder) and rarely bites with real cost or mistake, which keeps the evolution from feeling fully pressured. More embodied, contradictory impulses in a single moment of decision would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The immortal’s boredom and curiosity are clear and consistent, and his final choice to leave the escondite registers as a genuine shift. However, his interiority remains generalized—more archetype than individual—and his emotional experience is described in conceptual terms rather than embodied moments. The transition from ennui to “quiet awe” to purposeful resolve feels somewhat smooth and unstruggled, with little contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s goal (to produce proof for asylum using her father’s “mathematics of a fair trade”) is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. The legacy of being “the honest child of a notorious con artist” is thematically rich but remains more premise than dramatized inner conflict; we don’t see her genuinely torn between deceit and honesty in concrete choices. Her emotional experience is present yet often filtered through abstractions about perception and ideology rather than embodied contradiction. The closing shift to “fluid resolve” feels plausible but somewhat declared rather than hard-earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stationer has a clear, specific motivation and vocation, and his behaviors (scanning crevices, charting hues, writing invented histories) align with that. However, his interiority is mostly inferred through lyrical description; we get little direct, character-particular contradiction or emotional pressure. The realization that “invented histories were not lies but bridges” feels more like an essayistic thesis than a hard-won, dramatized shift. As a result, he reads as an elegant function of theme rather than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to reclaim meaning and function after bureaucratic erasure—is clear and coherently expressed through his obsession with fragments and textures of memory. His emotional life is embodied via tactile metaphors (corrugated metal, filaments against skin) rather than labels. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-temperature; he moves fairly smoothly from drift to purpose without much resistance or contradiction. The final stance as “unnamed keeper” is earned but not purchased with a strongly felt on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Selene’s core motive—to decode the universal riddle and test a myth—is clear and consistently enacted through her choices (placing the shell, engaging the cello, reading the ledger). However, her interiority skews declarative and thematic rather than textured with specific contradictions or embodied emotion. The late-mentor element adds a welcome emotional angle but is lightly sketched and never quite generates real pressure or conflict. Her final acceptance of the riddle’s nature feels earned but low-cost, more affirmation than change under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s role, skills, and loyalties are clear and consistent, and her decisions (decoding the chip, organizing graffiti, reshaping the layout) all track to those traits. However, her internal conflict around “dual allegiance” is mostly told rather than dramatized in specific, pressurized moments, so we don’t feel contradictory impulses grinding against each other in scene. Emotion is often labeled (“hopeful desperation”) rather than embodied through concrete sensation or behavior. The ending endurance/stance is credible but lightly felt rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inspector’s motivation is clear and consistent—he’s a professional archivist-artist figure whose reverence for the sand grain drives every action. His emotional state is rendered with specificity (melancholy, grief, a kind of sacred attentiveness) and we see micro-choices around calibration, timing, and ritual that fit his temperament. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction or real friction between duty and doubt; he never seriously wavers. The closing stance (grief laced with solace) feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s characterization as a blind, meticulous artisan is vivid and particular, with her sensory compensation and tenderness toward machines feeling grounded and specific. Her motivation—to perfect the hummingbird and translate its feedback into navigation—is clear and consistent. However, she encounters little internal contradiction or moral friction; her competence is rarely tested in a way that forces a difficult or revealing choice. The colleague’s arrival does not meaningfully pressure or reconfigure her stance, so relational dynamics remain underused.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to find and map the rivers’ origins—is clear and consistent, and her small but present arc from uneasy stasis to active transmission and recording feels earned. Her interiority has some specificity (“worrying tranquility,” her trust in the falcon’s timing), but internal contradiction is muted; she mostly moves in one emotional key of calm-dread. The “dry-witted” aspect is barely dramatized beyond a late nod (“her dry-witted sarcasm softened”), which blunts character-particular texture. Still, her choices (using the glass, treating the phrasebook as herald, aligning the transmitter, stepping out to witness and record) align with her role and goal in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    The tuner’s motive (“restore shared balance between the living pulse of people and the silent weight of architecture”) is clear and consistent, and his ritual choices track with that goal. However, interiority is almost entirely projected through the narrator’s abstractions rather than concrete, character-specific thought or embodied emotion. There’s no real internal conflict or visible cost to his patience or departure, so his arc lands as a serene function more than a pressured person. This limits the felt transformation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s core motive (chasing the vial, then realizing she wants to “harness the ephemeral”) is clear and her choice to let the distress signal fade tracks with that. We do get embodied fear (“tight coil of panic”) and the vial’s effect on her thoughts, but interior conflict is more narrated than dramatized. The renunciation of the beacon is the key character move, yet it happens quickly with little felt tug-of-war on the page. Strong, but not yet psychologically intricate enough for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    The boy’s core motivation—seeking redemption and hush after a legacy of false alarms—is clear and consistent, and his choices (following the corridor, retrieving the chest, going to the reef) align with it. However, his emotional life remains somewhat abstract and symbolic; we get little concrete, embodied ambivalence or fear as he faces eerie bodies and impossible magic. Internal contradiction is hinted (guilt vs. purpose) but not dramatized in specific, pressured micro-choices. The final peace feels earned enough for the length, but with limited visible cost or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bride’s core motive—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is clear and consistent, and her final renunciation (turning love into venom and dissolving) feels earned. However, her inner life remains more conceptual than embodied; we’re told her longing and “lovingly venomous affection” rather than seeing contradictory impulses play out in concrete micro-choices. Her actions (whispering to vines, placing the bead, releasing the sigh) track with the stated goal but rarely complicate or test it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    The weaver’s motivation (“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”) is clear and consistent, and her actions (breaking guild precedents, sewing light into stone) align with that. However, she functions more as an emblematic figure than as a fully embodied person; we get very little specific interior conflict or contradiction. There’s essentially no on-page resistance from other characters, so we don’t see her values tested in relationship. The closing affirmation feels earned within the parable frame but not hard-won on a human, psychological level.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to restore a broken ritual space and reconnect diaspora descendants—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with that goal. However, she experiences almost no contradictory impulses or visible doubt, so internal conflict remains thin. Her emotions are mostly conveyed through gentle wonder and reverence, which flattens potential complexity. The final sense of fulfillment is earned but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation (“to discover meaning in the margins”) is clear and consistent, and her ritual actions align with it, but we get almost no textured interiority or contradictory impulses under pressure. She rarely feels like a fully embodied person—more a function for the concept—so emotions and stakes stay abstract. The late gesture of whispering a pseudonym for herself hints at complexity but arrives without sufficient prior groundwork. As a result, the closing sense of change is conceptual rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    The embroiderer’s motivation—listening for unheard stories and preempting the coup—is clear and consistent, and her actions (stitching, interpreting, dispatching the chart) align with it. However, interiority remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied; we hear what she believes more than how it physically or emotionally costs her in the moment. Contradictory impulses (fear vs conviction, doubt vs faith in the flame) are implied but not dramatized in-scene. The ending smile reads a touch declarative (“knowing that…”) rather than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The medium’s desire to unburden herself of “unsent letters” is clear and consistent, and the shard functions as an externalization of that emotional weight. However, her interior conflict mostly arrives as stated insight (“she realized that…”) rather than dramatized contradiction in the moment. She rarely genuinely hesitates or makes costly tradeoffs; she moves through a preordained ritual more than a pressured choice. The final shift toward allowing the letters to speak works conceptually but feels somewhat frictionless emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    The translator has a clear, consistent motivation and a distinct gentleness, but her inner life remains more stated than dramatized. We’re told she’s “pacific” and “shrewdly innocent,” yet we rarely see those traits tested or put into tension with darker impulses. The child functions more as a symbolic vessel than a character with agency or contradiction. The final ache reads emotionally plausible, but it isn’t tied to a difficult, dramatized choice that reveals new facets of her.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    The artist’s core motivation (reviving joy through light-murals) is clear and consistent, and her actions track with it. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or real micro-conflict—she never doubts, fails, or pays a visible price. Her realizations (“true power… to illuminate hearts”) arrive smoothly without resistance or cost. As a result, the arc reads sincere but thin for elite-level characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s curiosity and her willingness to trade certainty for wonder are clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a mural restorer usefully colors her perceptions. However, internal conflict is muted: the “cost” of letting go of certainty is asserted more than dramatized, so contradictory impulses never feel particularly sharp. Her final choice to embrace curiosity feels emotionally fitting but almost frictionless. More textured hesitation or resistance around losing her familiar way of working would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysander’s core motive—protecting his “spark of defiance” from a world that taxes thoughts—is clear and consistent, and his actions (joining gardens, planting patterns) align with it. However, his emotions are mostly stated in conceptual language rather than embodied, and we see little genuine internal contradiction or fear of failure. Dr. Mirabel’s late decision to protect the garden is plausible but underdeveloped; we haven’t seen her wrestle with loyalty to institutions versus curiosity. The Loom members are essentially atmospheric and don’t complicate his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet’s core motivation (transmuting pain into beauty) is clear and consistently expressed, but we rarely see it tested in specific, pressured choices. His paradoxical nature (“shyly unstoppable”) is stated more than dramatized, so internal contradiction has limited bite. Emotion is present yet largely summarized rather than embodied in concrete, scene-level sensations or conflicting impulses. The final gratitude/kneeling moment lands, but the cost of his endurance feels generalized rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The caretaker’s central motive—preserving forgotten names—is clear and consistently embodied through ritual, but she faces little genuine dilemma or contradictory impulse on the page. Her “foxglove regret” and later gratitude sketch an arc, yet the emotional progression is smooth rather than pressured or paradoxical. The choice to stay in the work despite recurring loss reads as endurance, but it’s not dramatized against a tempting alternative. Strong mood, light on conflict-driven interior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation (restore a broken covenant of memory) is clear and consistent, and her mix of “careful” and “reckless” is named and faintly dramatized in her experimental method. However, interior conflict is mostly gestured at rather than embodied in concrete, pressured choices with visible cost. Her success arrives without real risk of failure or moral friction, so the final acceptance of further duty feels weighty in concept but lightly earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s vocation, competence, and core motive are clear and consistent, and her gentle, empathetic orientation toward technology comes through. However, she encounters almost no resistance; there’s little sense of strain, misgiving, or real risk, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her emotional life is mainly implied by the lush setting and concept rather than dramatized through hard choices. The elder’s brief appearance provides a nice relational beat but doesn’t truly test or complicate her.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s core motive (preserving lost songs as a way to survive grief) is clear and consistently enacted through her mapping and pigeon work, and her professional specificity as a courier pigeon trainer feels fresh. However, her interiority stays largely in a single register—gentle melancholy tilting toward hope—without much in-scene contradiction or sharp, character-particular ambivalence. The “reinvention” realization arrives more as a stated insight than as the culmination of dramatized, conflicted choices under pressure. The change at the end (learning to trust again) is legible but costs and resisted alternatives remain soft-focus.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The child’s sensibility is distinct—attuned to grain, distance, and thresholds—and his motivation to understand the maze and his mother’s legacy is clear. However, his emotional life is mostly rendered through abstractions (“necessary distances,” “weight of loss”) rather than concrete, embodied reactions. Internal contradiction is muted; we rarely see him wanting two incompatible things at once. His final stance as “guardian of thresholds” feels earned conceptually but not strongly tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aria’s core motive—to commune with the city and learn a “rhythm of belonging”—is clear and consistent, and her actions (entering, placing the feather, playing instruments) align with that desire. However, her interiority stays generalized and idealized; we get wonder and belonging but little contradiction, fear, or cost, so she risks feeling more like a function of the premise than a fully individuated person. The final shift (“even ash can illuminate new horizons”) reads more as a gentle affirmation than an earned renunciation or conflicted gain. The lack of visible internal struggle undercuts the depth required at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s core motive (solve the disappearing paths) is clear and consistent, and her emotional palette (bittersweet, hopeful, melancholy) feels coherent with the world. However, she encounters little real resistance or internal contradiction—she is almost entirely competent and serene, so we don’t see impulses meaningfully clash. Her choices are more procedural than pressured: collect seeds, read them, walk where they point. The final “vow” lands more as confirmation than as a costly shift in self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The performer’s core motivation—belief in “ordering randomness” and serenading monotony—is clear and consistent, and his choices (using bishops, ink, tide, then violin) express that. However, he experiences almost no internal contradiction or real pressure; he’s serene and certain throughout. The lack of genuine dilemma or emotional cost at the climax keeps him from feeling fully dimensional. This reads more as an elegant figure in a concept than as a psychologically rich individual.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s goal (to inscribe a cosmic verse on skin) and her choice of elective exile are clear and consistent, and her process of “fledging” through gaps gives her a distinct interior logic. However, she encounters little genuine resistance; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a real struggle between solitude and connection on the page. The final acceptance of exile-as-bridge feels more declared than earned through conflicted micro-choices. Strong concept of character, but under-pressured emotionally for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira’s sensibility and motivation are clear and consistent—she’s a contemplative artisan seeking meaning in the mundane—but her interiority remains largely serene, with little dramatized contradiction or pressure. The “unsettled thoughts” are gestured at rather than specified, so her arc from heaviness to lightness feels gentle but low-cost. Small micro-choices (tossing the stone, turning back toward the market, pocketing the talisman) do register as values-based but never face a genuine test. This yields a credible but relatively undemanding portrait rather than the kind of sharpened inner conflict an elite venue expects.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maren’s core motivation (turning pain into a universal language) is clear and consistent, and her past as a firefighter plus the scars give her some specificity. However, her emotions are mostly conveyed through abstract phrasing rather than embodied, character-particular reactions, so she can feel like a vessel for theme more than a fully individuated person. The internal conflict—guilt vs. mission—is implied but rarely dramatized as simultaneous, clashing impulses in scene. Her final realization, while coherent, lands a bit too neatly given the lack of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Arin’s motivation—to decode the gauge and restore communal hope—is clear and consistent, and his methodical, mathematical bent comes through, but he experiences almost no genuine resistance or contradiction on the page. His emotional life remains largely summarized rather than embodied; we’re told of “serene upheaval” more than we feel a specific, character-particular unease or risk. The council and villagers function as an abstract collective rather than concrete pressures on him. The closing “proof” moment lands intellectually but without a visible personal cost or difficult renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s core desire and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her actions (lighting the fire, using the film, returning nightly) align with that motivation. However, there’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse—she rarely hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible emotional price. The “legacy’s burden” is more stated than dramatized as an actual strain on her. Her acceptance at the end feels smooth and somewhat costless rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mirage painter has a clear backstory-driven motivation, but his interiority remains abstract and largely unpressured, with virtually no contradictory impulses or real-time emotional struggle. His calm, graceful demeanor never cracks or complicates, so we don’t see values tested by resistance. The ending registers as fulfilment rather than a costly choice, which limits character movement. Overall he feels more like a symbolic function than a fully inhabited person.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira is clearly motivated by a desire to end a “forever war” and to turn ritual into genuine resolution, and her embodied responses (the ache on her shoulders, the tear at the end) give her some dimensionality. However, she is rendered almost entirely as a noble, competent mediator with very little visible flaw or contradiction. Her “operatively gentle” nature is asserted but not meaningfully tested or made costly in scene. The chieftains remain largely faceless, softening quickly without much individual pressure on her, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The philanthropist’s blend of cruelty, calculation, and tenderness is vivid and consistent, and details like the tear “that tasted of sand and redemption” land well. However, his internal conflict is mostly told in overview (“motivations were fractured”) rather than dramatized through charged in-scene micro-choices. The key act—the release—is entirely pre-decided, so we don’t see him pressed into a genuine dilemma on the page. The result is strong characterization with limited on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courtesan’s motivation (to break the city’s lullaby of conformity) is clear and consistent, and her embodied connection to song gives her a distinct, if abstract, identity. However, we get little true internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; she moves from intent to success with near-perfect alignment. Her “chaste” and “courtesan” paradox is stated but never meaningfully pressured or complicated in scene. The final change feels largely external (the city awakens) rather than earned through visible personal cost or an altered self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    Selene’s motives—to pursue “ethical storytelling” and half-lit epiphanies—are consistent and clearly dramatized in her choices to seek the dome, arrange the dishes, and recommit to puppet shows. However, she experiences almost no real internal contradiction or embodied emotional friction; she remains serenely aligned with her thesis throughout. Feelings are often presented as conceptual stances rather than rooted in physical or conflicted responses. The final “change” (a refined intention for her next show) feels intellectually coherent but low-cost and emotionally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and coherently expressed through her actions with the knots and the moth wing. However, she experiences little real internal contradiction or friction; her desire is never meaningfully tested. Emotional states are largely harmonious with the setting rather than pressurized by it, which softens impact. The final “guardian of the unnoticed” stance feels consistent but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motive (preserving forgotten names after self-forgiveness) is clear and consistent, and some embodied emotion (“snowmelt ardor”) ties her interior to the environment. However, she encounters little genuine resistance; her competence is never meaningfully tested, and contradictory impulses don’t surface in-scene. The arc from doubt to purpose is mostly declared rather than dramatized under pressure, which blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Foresight’s core motivation and capability are clearly established, and her actions (using the wafer, interpreting dreams, incantation) track cleanly with that. However, her interiority leans descriptive rather than conflicted; there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk in her choices. The epiphany arrives without much visible struggle or error, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned. Emotional embodiment is present but often abstracted into concept rather than grounded contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Nabu’s frugality, intellectual curiosity, and devotion are clearly established and consistent, and his global motivation (to aid his people via a cosmic covenant) is legible. However, his interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in specific moments of doubt or conflict. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure; once he decides to pursue the covenant, nothing strains or complicates that desire. The ending presents an internal shift toward “renewed reverence” without any visible cost or hard choice that would deepen his characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s “scheming pacifist” identity is intriguing and consistent, and her nonviolent manipulation of the monks is clear and aligned with her philosophy. However, her interiority remains abstract—she’s defined more by beliefs than by textured, contradictory impulses under pressure. The monks and wanderer function mainly as receivers of grace rather than fully realized agents, so the emotional cost of their change feels somewhat smoothed over. The final outcome (her scheme working flawlessly) lacks visible doubt, guilt, or friction that would deepen character complexity at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arlen’s motivation (to capture and restore the runaway dream) is clear and his actions consistently follow from his craft-bound, patient temperament, but we rarely see contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict. His “firmly grounded” nature lets him function almost as a serene ritual specialist rather than a person under pressure, which keeps the final commitment to guard the dream from feeling costly. The interiority is evocative yet generalized—more about atmosphere than character-specific thought. This works for a lyric piece but falls short of truly deep, individuated characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s vocation, lineage, and maternal role are clear and consistently motivate her choices, and the micro-choice of using the ribbon repair to inspire mending the lenses is solidly grounded in character. The relationship with Mira is tender and particular enough to feel lived-in, especially in the thorn and ribbon beat. However, Lira is almost entirely competent and good, with little dramatized flaw or genuine internal contradiction under pressure. The change at the end feels more like an articulated realization than a hard-won shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.0)
    The curator has a clear through-line—bewildered curiosity and pursuit of forbidden knowledge—but he remains more a vessel for concept than a fully embodied person. His emotions are mostly labeled rather than felt in the body; we get “disquiet” and “bewildered curiosity,” but few concrete, character-specific reactions. Internal conflict is thin: he never seriously wavers about surrendering linear narrative, so the final acceptance lacks visible cost. The arc from confusion to acceptance is plausible but not deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Selene’s motivation is clear and consistent—she is on a rescue mission to save “knowledge that had never been learned”—and her competence as an arcane linguist feels specific. However, she experiences little on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulse; we don’t see fear, doubt, or cost complicate her choices. The time traveler is more a symbolic witness than a pressuring presence. The final choice to step through the next portal is in character but comes without much emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (recapturing verses to reach the garden of forgotten names) and sustained, and we see a conceptual shift when she realizes the “true recapture was not of objects, but of stories.” However, interiority remains mostly abstract—little embodied emotion or contradictory impulse—and the change comes more as stated insight than as a hard-won, costed decision. The chimera’s specific psyche and flaws feel sketched in by role and milieu rather than by distinct, pressure-tested inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation—translating confusion into clarity—is cleanly articulated and consistently drives her actions, and her archivist habits ground her choices. However, she encounters almost no resistance, doubt, or internal contradiction, so we see competence more than conflict. Emotional experience is implied rather than embodied; we’re told her warmth and method but rarely feel them under pressure. The final “change” is largely conceptual, without a sharply felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation is clear and consistent, but he functions more as a ritual guardian than a fully conflicted person, with almost no contradictory impulses on the page. His emotional life is mostly inferred from the prose rather than dramatized in concrete, embodied reactions. The closest we get to interior shift—“He understood that the quiet he sought was not the absence of sound”—arrives as a tidy articulation rather than a hard-won, messy realization. The vigil at the end reads as an earned stance, but it doesn’t feel like it cost him anything visible in this window.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.5)
    The custodian’s core motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—is clear and consistent, and their caretaking actions follow logically from it. However, interiority stays in a single register of quiet hope with little contradiction or genuine doubt, so we rarely see competing impulses on the page. Emotional experience is often stated in thematic language (“hope,” “purpose”) rather than grounded in more specific, embodied reactions under pressure. The end stance is essentially a continuation of the opening stance, so the change reads as extension rather than a charged reconfiguration of self.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.3)
    The archivist’s motivation and emotional palette (preemptive nostalgia, grief/joy blend) are clear and consistent, and his professional lens feels specific. However, he rarely faces a genuine dilemma or contradictory impulse; his arc is more of deepened affirmation than pressured change. The shift from “preemptive nostalgia” to “steady resolve” is legible but low-cost and largely reflective. Character remains evocative but somewhat static for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    The designer’s core motive—defying “the gravity of hopelessness” through fireworks—is clear and consistent, but it’s asserted more than dramatized. Interiority is mostly thematic rather than psychologically specific; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. His choices (coming to the fortress, using the knot, chanting) align with his stated purpose but carry little visible cost. As a result, he reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.0)
    The chronicler’s desire “to discover the texture of time” is consistent and specific, but she experiences little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure. Her calm competence never really wavers, and there’s no visible cost to her choices beyond mild exertion. The clan leaders are sketched as functions (chieftains) rather than individuated characters. The final soft smile and satisfaction feel earned but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lio’s desire to collect silences and his bunker-bred claustrophobia are clear and specific, and his decision to climb during inversion is cleanly motivated. His interiority is sensorially embodied (“chest… like a rubber band nearing its limit”) rather than labeled. However, there’s little real internal contradiction or felt risk once he commits; the journey and transformation feel relatively smooth and unresisted. The mother’s role is mostly expository and doesn’t significantly pressure his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira’s vocation and motivation are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (whispering counter-tones, adjusting speed, opening/emptying the vial) align with her mission. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her belief in silence as comfort is never challenged. The line “She understood that to catalyze comfort, she must first dissolve the agitation within herself” gestures at an inner struggle but it’s told, not dramatized, and carries no visible cost. As a result, the ending feels more like completion of a process than a hard-won shift in her character.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mina’s core motivation and role as lore keeper are clear and consistent, but her interior life remains relatively thin for this level of ambition. We rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt; she moves from task to task with near-total confidence. The acceptance of the throne feels emotionally under-pressured because her misgivings or fears are never dramatized. The result is a compelling figure in outline, but not yet a fully inhabited character.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tender shadow keeper has a clear, consistent motive and a distinct sensibility, and his final step through the threshold follows from the earlier setup of isolation and teaching darkness to breathe. However, his inner life is mostly rendered via abstracted mission statements rather than specific, contradictory impulses in the moment. The repeated note of him burning bridges carefully implies cost but doesn’t deepen into embodied conflict or doubt. As a result, he feels more like an archetypal function than a fully inhabited person.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s trauma from the pyramid scheme versus their pull toward hope is specific and convincing, and it cleanly motivates their hesitation and eventual choice about the bolt. Embodied emotion is present in moments like feeling the vessel’s “ancient tension” and sensing the quantum promise as a song. However, the internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly into righteous clarity, with little visible cost or lingering contradiction once the diamonds appear. Lira and the manager are sketched effectively but remain mostly functional rather than fully pressure-bearing foils.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lian’s motive—to uncover his lineage’s hidden truth—is clear and consistent, and his actions (cranking the gramophone, following the vibrations, lifting the floorboard) align with that drive. However, his interiority is largely abstracted into poetic description rather than grounded in specific, contradictory feelings or fears, so we don’t see genuine internal conflict. The “dynasty ender” role is thematically rich but under-dramatized; there’s little sense of what he risks emotionally by learning this truth. His final realization feels more declared than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The knight’s interior is sketched with some specificity—his withdrawal, oath, and desire “to capture the shape of possibility”—and his final allegiance shift is legible. However, his emotional life remains mostly in abstracted, symbolic language rather than concrete, embodied contradiction, so his change of loyalty feels more like a conceptual pivot than a hard-won personal cost. There’s little sense of competing impulses on the page; he moves fairly smoothly from solitude to participation. The result is a coherent but somewhat bloodless arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Amelia is specific and coherent—a “broken-hearted archivist” whose impulse to honor small kindnesses clearly drives her choices with the button and the files. Her emotional palette, however, stays in a narrow band of gentle melancholy and hope, with little contradictory impulse or genuine internal conflict on the page. The supervisor functions as a soft echo rather than a pressure source, so relational dynamics don’t truly test her. The final shift to a “steadier” heart is believable but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is clearly sketched as an underestimated, quietly resolute, resourceful rebel whose actions drive the plot, but her interiority remains relatively thin and generalized. We rarely feel her body or mind under pressure; she moves through the scene with almost effortless competence and little on-page doubt or contradictory impulse. The small moment of withholding the map later hints at a richer complexity but isn’t deeply dramatized. Overall, the characterization is appealing and coherent but not yet at an elite, fully inhabited level.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    The saxophonist’s core motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority and contradiction are thin for this level—he rarely wavers or reveals a clashing impulse beyond solemn duty. His past with his father and the “language of fog” adds a touch of specificity, yet it doesn’t significantly complicate the present choice. Emotional experience is mostly implied through setting rather than embodied reactions or idiosyncratic thought. The ending presents endurance and solitude as a cost, but that cost is only lightly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s core motive—to decode the leaves and honor forgotten forest spirits—is clear and consistently tied to her ordered, ritualistic nature. However, she lacks real internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her transformation reads as a smooth fulfillment rather than a costly change. Emotional states are mostly implied via imagery (“mossy delight”) instead of embodied tension or doubt. The final role as “bridge between root and sky” feels thematically apt but not earned through hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation, worldview, and curiosity are clearly motivated and consistently drive her choices, especially her decision to trust the compass and reorient her craft. However, her internal conflict stays relatively low-pressure; there’s little real friction between the desire for certainty (fixing clocks) and the embrace of uncertainty beyond thematic statements. The shift at the brazier reads more as graceful acceptance than a hard-won, costly choice. Still, she feels particular and non-generic, with embodied responses to place and objects.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist’s motive—to redeem the coin and probe the “weight of names”—is clear, consistent, and filtered through her disciplined, measuring temperament. Her regret over the search party and her commitment to factual mysticism form a coherent, particular interiority. The main limitation is that her internal conflict stays relatively smooth; there’s little on-page push–pull or genuine risk that she might choose differently. The closing shift toward gratitude feels earned but arrives without a sharp, dramatized moment of doubt or temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s role and desires are clear and consistent, and her actions (following the notes, using the tooth, choosing to tell the joke) align with that drive. The interiority is serviceable but not particularly deep or conflicted; “modestly fearless” is more asserted than dramatized. Her realization of purpose at the end is earned but emotionally tidy, with limited sense of sacrifice or moral ambiguity. The piece hints at richer contradiction (“ache of their grief…hidden corners of her own heart”) without fully exploiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation and interiority are specific and consistent—her quest for the “mathematics of mercy” grows organically from her history as an interrogation survivor. Embodied detail like the pewter strap and proprioceptive guidance grounds her psychic state. However, her conflict skews conceptual; we get less on-the-page contradiction between impulses and more declarative realization. The final shift (strap as promise, not shackle) is earned but somewhat tidy given the depth of trauma evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s role and motivation are clear and specific—between-worlds translator honoring overlooked histories—but there is very little genuine inner conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure. Emotional texture leans more toward steady reverence than dynamically shifting feeling. The parental memories add warmth and depth but don’t meaningfully complicate present choices. The closing promise to unseen sailors feels earned but low-cost, keeping the arc modest rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is distinct—a blue-collar tech with ghost-sight and a methodical, almost scientific curiosity—and her actions consistently arise from that blend of competence and sensitivity. Her emotional arc from “weightless burden” to “quiet purpose” is clear and earned by the ledger discovery. However, she experiences little genuine ambivalence or contradiction under pressure, so her internal life feels slightly too smooth for top-tier literary work. The ghosts’ gratitude and her acceptance land, but without a sharp, costly inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s core motivation—to “compress eternity into a moment”—is clear and consistent, and her choices (pressing the bottle into the ink, arranging the frost spiral) track with that desire. However, her emotional life remains largely abstract; we get very little embodied fear, doubt, or cost despite the stated danger of destabilizing a “perfect system.” Internal contradiction is minimal, and she never seriously wavers, which keeps the arc flatter than the premise invites. The ending realization feels more like an idea landing than a deeply earned psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—transmuting a failed rebellion into cultural rebirth—is clear and consistent, and her “burnished sorrow” gives her an identifiable emotional texture. However, we get little in-the-moment contradiction or genuine doubt as she executes the plan; the internal conflict is largely retrospective rather than dramatized under pressure. Her actions align with her past and aims, but the scene rarely forces her into a difficult trade-off that would more sharply define her.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Alder is clearly motivated (ancestral craft, duty to the town, “to reclaim the light stolen by midnight”) and his competence is well dramatized through his tools and methods. However, his interiority remains fairly one-note—calm, reverent focus with little contradiction or real doubt under pressure. The emotional journey from summoned repairman to guardian of the covenant is smooth but low-cost, with no visible internal struggle that tests his values. This yields a solid but not yet deeply memorable characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara has clear, consistent motivation and a distinctive sensibility (petrichor, psychometry, fascination with “hinges”), and her choices drive the story. However, her inner life remains relatively smooth and unconflicted—she moves from curiosity to acceptance without much visible hesitation or contradictory impulse. The realization about explanations failing is conceptually apt but arrives as a clean insight rather than something she struggles toward on the page. The change is credible and aligned with her traits, but the cost and internal friction feel understated for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motives and sensibility are clear and consistent—an artist obsessed with learning, connection, and translating complexity into accessible form. Her choices (using the lantern, reimagining the arch, shifting from single figure to layered tableau) arise organically from that core. However, interior conflict is minimal; she rarely feels genuinely torn or under pressure, so the final realization costs her little beyond a gentle shift of perspective. The repeating formulations (“perpetually learning,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”) label her more than they dramatize contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and coherent, and her emotional reaction to the vision is embodied enough (tears, humming heart) to feel specific. However, she remains largely unconflicted: the “lingering winter” and “cold doubts” are named more than dramatized, so the final shift costs her little on the page. Her mural-artist identity barely affects her perceptions or choices beyond flavor. The resulting arc feels sincere but somewhat tidy and low-friction for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation as a civil-rights archivist is strong and consistent, and her actions all track cleanly with her goal of recovering suppressed testimony. However, interior contradiction is minimal: “searing reverie” names intensity but rarely manifests as concrete, conflicted impulses on the page. Her choices, while purposeful, rarely entail visible personal cost or genuine moral friction. The final stance shift (from burning reverie to steadied certainty) is stated more than earned through dramatized micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist’s core motivation—to revive the town without resorting to “false comfort”—is clear and consistent, and his interiority about memory-as-tool fits his role. However, his emotional life is largely declarative and idealized; we rarely see embodied doubt, fear, or fatigue. The supposed temptation of easy magic is summarized rather than dramatized, so internal conflict feels conceptual more than lived. The final stance (walking away, promising to return) feels earned but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Harel’s vocation, sensory rituals, and relationship to dead languages give him specificity, and his re-interpretation of the prophecy is a coherent internal turn. However, his emotional life remains relatively smooth and dignified—little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle under pressure shows on the page. The shift from uneasy listener to serene accepter of a predestined loop feels interesting but low-cost. A touch more dramatized reluctance or conflict over what to do with the prophecy would deepen his characterization substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivations (guarding the covenant, wanting to “discover the texture of borrowed time”) are clear and consistent, and her interiority is rendered through specific sensory attention rather than labels. However, internal conflict is muted: she feels “furiously tranquil,” but we never see a live alternative (refusal, fear, resentment) exert real pressure on her choices. Her acceptance of the role and planting the seed feel earned but low-cost, more initiation rite than hard-won decision. The story succeeds at specificity of character but stops short of a deeply conflicted or ambivalent inner arc.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tester’s motivation is clear and consistent—his “credibly curious” temperament and desire to favor listening over noise justify his volunteering and meticulous care. However, he experiences almost no internal contradiction or sharp emotional pressure; he’s calm, competent, and scarcely challenged. The final sense of “quiet stewardship” feels earned but low-cost. This limits the depth and complexity of characterization expected at a top literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The janitor’s vocation, reverence for fallen stars, and desire to “find strength in vulnerability” are clearly motivated and consistent. However, his interiority remains largely serene and aligned with the premise; there’s little on-page contradiction or struggle between impulses. Emotional states are mostly labeled via elevated abstractions rather than grounded in specific bodily reactions. The change at the end (greater assurance and understanding) is gentle and credible but carries limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recluse’s core motivation—to preserve the weight of unspoken words—is clear and consistent, and his dawning understanding of the covenant gives him a modest internal shift. However, he rarely experiences visible internal contradiction; his “astonishment” and calm don’t evolve into a more complex emotional palette. His choice to honor the covenant feels earned but not deeply contested, so the cost of his solitude and silence stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara’s goal—to understand the “texture of time passing” by rediscovering the capsule’s purpose—is clear and consistent, and her actions track logically from that desire. However, her interior life remains mostly abstract; we get almost no embodied emotion or contradictory impulses under pressure. The “borrowed-time” detail never meaningfully shapes her choices or imposes cost. Her final fulfillment feels granted rather than hard-won, which flattens character change.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet’s core motivation—to tend the lagoon and honor incompleteness—is clear and consistent, but he remains more emblematic than fully individuated. His “warmly attentive” nature is told and echoed, yet almost never challenged or put under genuine strain. There’s no substantial internal contradiction or moral friction; he always chooses the same gentle caretaking stance. As a result, the closing realization feels like an articulation of a static disposition rather than an earned shift with real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her methodical choices drive the orchard transformation, but she’s rendered as almost purely virtuous and calm, with little real internal conflict. The looming six‑month limit doesn’t meaningfully disturb her composure or generate contradictory impulses on the page. Emotional states are more often summarized than embodied in specific, pressured moments. The final “revelation” she voices feels a bit pre-packaged rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Arin’s motivation—to interrogate the first contact event rather than venerate it—is clear and consistent, and his use of the amber is a concrete, character-specific tactic. However, his “luminous skeptic” and “academically rebellious” traits stay mostly descriptive; we see little genuine inner contradiction or cost beyond a generalized defiance. His realization about homecoming as dialogue lands, but the emotional shift feels conceptually neat rather than hard-won in scene. The scholars remain a faceless mass, so no relational pressure tempers his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    The coachman’s motivation (ancestral duty and quiet ecological repair) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with that goal throughout. However, he lacks on-page contradiction or real ambivalence; he functions more as a symbolic custodian than a fully individuated, pressured person. Emotional experience is more inferred from atmosphere than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The “weight of his ancestors” lifting reads as an earned beat but not as the culmination of visible inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rook’s characterization is vivid and specific—a retired corpse-finder turned “guardian of memories” with concrete sensory habits and a clear, emotionally grounded motive. His actions (decoding the cylinder, seeking and then resealing the leaf) align well with that motive and culminate in a credible redefinition of purpose. What’s missing at a truly top tier is sharper internal contradiction or felt struggle; the transitions from curiosity to acceptance of the new role are smooth, almost frictionless. The emotional burden of carrying others’ voices is implied more than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator’s desire for orientation and to honor family ritual is clear and consistent, but their inner life skews abstract—more idea than embodied person. Moments like “turn confusion into exploration” state motive rather than dramatize conflicting impulses in scene. There’s little sense of irrationality, fear, or anger under pressure; grief feels smoothed over. The final “pilgrimage” stance is credible but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander is vivid, with clear motives (amending the ancient betrayal, chivalrous theft, love of wonder) and embodied responses (“cautious abandon of a child daring to touch a storm”). However, his internal conflict is minimal—he never seriously doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible emotional price—so his realization about being a “bridge” feels more like confirmation than transformation. The arc is coherent but low-friction, which softens the impact of his closing promise to keep amending wrongs.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to witness and preserve erased “small gestures”—is clear, consistent, and rooted in her paradoxical history as a crisis actor turned actual survivor. We get a strong sense of her moral stance (“benevolently ruthless”) but less of her concrete, contradictory impulses in action under pressure. Her choices (walking the patterns, accepting the charge of the scroll) are coherent but not deeply conflict-ridden on the page. The emotional life stays a bit abstract and emblematic rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—to recover a “shape of home” eroded by the mountain—is clear and consistent, and her interiority is sensually rendered rather than generic. Her micro-choices (following the stone’s hum, using the feather, opening the book, then returning the stone) align with that drive. What’s missing, at this standard, is sharper internal contradiction or visible struggle at the decision points; she rarely hesitates or acts against herself. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost, more serene realization than hard-won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tutor’s guilt, exile, and chess-specific backstory give him particularity, and his actions (entering the labyrinth, decoding threads, finally relinquishing the pawn) align with his motive. Interiority is concrete—chess metaphors, tactile engagement with tapestry and stones—but internal contradiction is only lightly dramatized rather than really tearing at him. The shift from self-condemnation to self-forgiveness is emotionally legible and earned enough, though it resolves a bit smoothly for the magnitude of “cost a war.” Strong character work, but not yet at the level of deep, messy ambivalence an elite venue would expect.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is clearly motivated—she wants to pay the canyon’s price for forgiveness through art—and her actions (gathering townsfolk, initiating the chant, painting the mural, final sky-line) align with that. However, her interiority stays mostly in thematic generalities (“believed that forgiveness had a price”) rather than textured, contradictory impulses under pressure. The relationship with Lio is sweet but not really a crucible; no one on the page meaningfully pushes back against her. The final softening of her “defiant spirit” is credible but would land harder if more sharply contrasted against earlier internal resistance or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist’s uncertainty and gradual resolve are clear and mostly well-motivated, with embodied touches like the charm warming and her heart ticking like clockwork. However, her inner life remains more archetypal than individuated, and her turn from doubt to near-serene confidence feels a bit smooth and unconflicted. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses coexisting under pressure; once she commits to “a story of repair,” the path is fairly linear. The ending’s shift to quiet confidence is earned enough for this length but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The painter’s longing for “temporary eternity” through art is clear and consistent, and his choices (entering the caves, taking the shell, unlocking the painted chest, making the new painting) all flow from that motive. However, internal conflict is muted: the supposed “test of my intimate aloofness” is stated rather than dramatized in a moment of genuine hesitation or risk. Emotions are often rendered via metaphor and atmosphere instead of concrete, contradictory impulses under pressure. The closing renunciation/acceptance (“promised anew to keep the hidden oath to myself”) lands, but the cost of that stance is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation—to prove that softened intent has real reach—is clear and consistent, and her emotional responses are embodied (“screaming tenderness,” tears, heartbeat). However, her interiority skews declarative and idealized rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure or a real cost to her choice. The fisherman functions as a cipher rather than a pressure source. The final realization feels emotionally continuous with the opening, more affirmation than earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The navigator’s drive “to navigate the geography of loss” is clear and consistently embodied in her rituals and engineering, and her acceptance at the end feels earned. However, she remains more emblematic than psychologically particular; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or real wobble in her purpose. Her emotions are mostly inferred from the imagery and actions rather than rendered in concrete, character-specific interiority. This keeps her compelling but slightly distant, more symbol than fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motive to turn the eye into a communal mirror is clear and rooted in her history with the empathy virus, and her “involuntary truthfulness” is an interesting, character-specific constraint. Interiority is mostly conceptual rather than bodily, but it is still distinct and coherent. The main weakness is limited on-page struggle: her internal conflict about protecting the community versus exploiting the smugglers never quite bites, and the smugglers remain thin sketches rather than real pressures. The closing shift toward “tending the glass eye” reads earned but a touch too easy, with little felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlowe is specific and memorable—his frayed coat, alpine flower, and tide-reading habit all feel character-particular, and his motive to "decode the stranger’s final gesture" is clear. His emotional journey from isolating loneliness to a sense of being “truly seen” is coherent and earned. However, his interior conflict remains fairly gentle; we rarely see contradictory impulses under real pressure, so his final choice carries limited felt cost. This keeps a strong portrait from reaching deeper, crucible-level complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motive (keeping a promise, searching for the “doorway of decisions”) is clear and consistent, and his profession nicely colors his worldview. However, his inner conflict is underdeveloped: the crucial moment when he chooses to step back from the endless horizons is more asserted than dramatized with contradictory impulses. Emotional embodiment skews abstract (“a lingering promise bound his heart”) rather than lived in the body. The final change—solitude becoming a “bridge”—lands, but with limited felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen’s goal (end the recurring dreams / answer the kingdom’s pleas) is clear and her choices drive the story, but her inner life stays generalized and mostly expressed through externalized imagery rather than specific, individuated thought. We rarely see contradictory impulses in-scene—her “darker curiosity” never meaningfully clashes with duty once she sets out. The retinue are pure backdrop and offer no relational pressure. Her transformation at the orb reads more as a mythic inevitability than as a hard-won, psychologically particular change.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist has a clear desire and a mildly distinctive worldview, but his interior conflict is almost nonexistent; he never wavers, doubts, or pays a visible emotional price. The friends function as a collective blur with no individuated presence or pressure. The closing realization about “true alchemy” feels more like an authorial thesis than a hard-won, character-specific shift. Overall, we see competence and mild wonder, not a crucible that reveals deeper flaws or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to trap chaotic dreams and jealous past selves into narrative—is clear and consistent, and small choices (unrolling the scroll, choosing to write, finally stepping outside) align with it. Internal contradiction between the grave’s pull and the desire to “soar again” is present but mostly articulated abstractly rather than embodied in messy, conflicting impulses on the page. Emotional states are vivid yet often labeled in conceptual language (“feral nostalgia,” “chronologically confused mind”) instead of grounded in concrete, contradictory reactions under pressure. The final resolve to see the grave as a marker for unwritten stories feels earned, though the cost is more intellectual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena is specific, embodied, and consistent: an anosmic aromatherapist whose tactile, reverent approach to objects feels particular and credible. Her motives (to unveil “ordinary miracles” via touch and ritual) are clear and aligned with her actions throughout. However, internal conflict is minimal—she moves from quiet purpose to quiet affirmation without a strongly dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse in scene, so the final realization feels more confirmed than hard-won. The arc reads as deepening of an existing stance rather than a pressured shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—to transform her scars into healing stories—is clear, specific, and consistently tied to her actions in the ceremony. We get some embodied interiority through breath, ritual focus, and sensory attention, but little genuine internal contradiction or resistance as the ritual unfolds. Her change at the end (reframing scars as luminous runes) is earned but arrives without much struggle, which softens impact. The absence of a relational crucible (grandmother is only memory, no other on-page character) keeps her from fully sharpening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The exorcist’s guilt-driven motivation and profession-specific habits are clear and consistent, and her choice to perform this risky, improvised ritual reads as earned. However, her inner conflict is somewhat smoothed over—there’s little resistance or self-justification around Mara, so we don’t feel the full friction of apologizing to someone who exposed her sins. Emotions are often mediated through metaphor rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The final sense of “weight lifting” works but could land harder if more ambivalence or fear of rejection were dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist’s goal—to unravel cosmic illusions—is clear, but she remains more archetype than individuated person. Interiority is largely rendered through grand abstractions rather than concrete, character-specific thought or embodied emotion. Her key choice (initiating and completing the ritual with the dictionary and crystal) is motivated but faces no visible inner contradiction or doubt. The cost of her vanishing and “aching peace” is gestured at rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shepherd’s motivation—to understand what clocks really measure—is clear, consistent, and filtered through specific habits (the key in his pocket, the counting ritual). His interiority is concrete and tied to the environment rather than abstract musing. The internal shift at the end (from “time” to “intervals between breaths”) is credible but low-cost, with little dramatized inner conflict or contradiction along the way. This keeps the arc affecting but not yet deep or fraught enough for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator is specific (intrusion detection specialist, “spatially gifted”) with a coherent interior lens, but they remain almost frictionlessly competent and emotionally even. Motivation to protect the farm and explore “letting go” is stated rather than deeply tested. There’s little contradictory impulse on the page—no moment where duty, fear, or doubt genuinely competes with their calm clarity. The workers stay faceless, so relationships never become a crucible that pressures the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s core motivation (reconciling probability with gambling and inheritance) is clear and consistent, and her particular lens on odds, ledgers, and equations feels specific rather than stock. However, her grief over her mother and her gambler’s itch remain mostly conceptual; they don’t generate vivid, contradictory impulses in-scene. She moves through the tunnels with relative composure and little visible emotional destabilization. The final act of writing a new theorem is motivated but not deeply earned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority and motivation (“cultivated estrangement,” “teaching endings how to begin”) feel specific and consistent, and her final shift toward “quiet communion” is credible within the piece’s logic. However, her emotions are largely conceptual rather than bodily embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure—her change feels more like an idea turning than a struggle. Lena is effective but thin, serving more as a thematic instrument than a fully realized other. The cost of Mara’s transformation (what she truly risks by softening estrangement) is only lightly implied, not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist’s motivation—renewing a covenant and preserving “the weight of small moments”—is clear and consistent, and his reverent, methodical nature comes through in specific behaviors (his gait, how he handles the locket, the care in his writing). However, interior conflict is minimal: he rarely hesitates or feels torn, so we don’t see contradictory impulses tested under pressure. The closing recommitment to his purpose feels emotionally apt but not deeply reconfigured by what has happened on the page. As a result, he reads as textured but not yet fully dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lira is vivid, with a clear blend of competence and whimsical idealism, and her desire to “find the cure for loneliness” motivates all her actions. However, she faces little genuine friction or morally complicated choice; her logistics brilliance and “polite anarchy” are stated more than truly tested. Internal contradiction (jocular vs. earnest) is gestured at but not dramatized under pressure. The caretaker and volunteers function as light foils but exert minimal character pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation and inner orientation are clear and coherent—she wants to map emotional depths rather than geography—but her interiority is more asserted than dramatized, with little concrete struggle or contradiction under pressure. Her blindness and language-absorbing skin give texture but don’t generate many difficult micro-choices. The final “completion” of her soul-map feels more granted by the forest’s mechanics than wrestled-from-conflict. This keeps the arc emotionally appealing but somewhat frictionless for an elite literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s profession, prior mistake, and “confidently uncertain” stance give them specificity, and their choice to re-edit the experiment is motivated and coherent. However, internal conflict is mostly described rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional arc—from shame and uncertainty toward comfort and readiness—is believable but psychologically smooth and low-friction. The lack of on-page resistance or visible cost to their corrective choice keeps the character work from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen has a clear, particular motivation and a felt emotional state (“joyful sorrow”) that aligns with his actions, and Lira’s brief entrance still gives her a distinct, credible response to the harbor. However, there is very little on-page contradiction or genuine dilemma—no moment where competing impulses visibly pull either character apart. The “whispering advisor” role is evocative but underused interpersonally; he advises no one on the page. The final vow from Lira constitutes a modest but believable internal shift rather than a hard, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The arsonist’s motivation (fulfilling his mentor’s promise and seeking redemption) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and the fire-setting habit is nicely inverted into a tool for discovery. Interiority is present and specific (“volcanic tenderness,” “fierce love tempered by the gentle heat of remembrance”), though his inner conflict rarely manifests as simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure. His shift from destroyer to guardian is credible but largely frictionless, with little on-page resistance or temptation. More micro-choices under stress would deepen him beyond an archetypal penitent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully individuated character: we’re told she is “quietly rebellious” and wants “to breathe life into a shared dream,” but we rarely see contradictory impulses or real hesitation under pressure. Her actions—humming, drumming, perching higher—align with this trait set but are almost entirely unopposed, giving her arc a fable-like smoothness. The late realization of “the purpose of her rebellion” feels gently earned but low-cost, with little sense of what she risks in defying the lab. This keeps the characterization solid but not yet at a level of psychological complexity a top venue would expect.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Milo’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his choices directly drive the action, but he never faces real internal contradiction or cost. His belief in whispers over shouts is interesting, yet it’s barely tested; everything largely works on the first try. Emotional experience is sketched more than embodied, and we don’t see his composure crack or his certainty meaningfully waver. The final validation feels earned enough for this length, but not deeply transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guardian has a clear, consistent motivation (teaching darkness the value of stars) but little interior contradiction or embodied emotion; it reads more as a symbol than a fully individuated character. Its “spiralingly calm” patience never comes under strain, so we don’t see values tested. The lone fisherman registers faintly as an observer rather than a pressure on the guardian. The ending “smiled within its mirrored gaze” hints at feeling but arrives without much groundwork in internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s core motivation—quietly subverting rote education through chess—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with this throughout. However, she reads more as an emblem of “humble rebellion” than as a fully conflicted individual, with little visible internal contradiction or cost. The closing tableau of her “cradling the magnetic grotto…as if it were a newborn rebellion” is emotionally apt but doesn’t reveal new layers of her psyche. The piece would reach a higher tier with more friction between her doubts, desires, and the town’s response.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s dual drive—to protect the harbor and to break free—is clearly articulated and consistent, and her choices (answering the whale’s call, going to the island, singing) track with that conflict. However, the internal struggle is more told than dramatized, with phrases like “she understood the combat within herself” serving as labels rather than embodied tension in specific moments. Her final transformation into “quiet resolve” and peace-defender feels somewhat unearned because we don’t see her genuinely tempted to refuse or fail. The lack of on-page cost in her shift keeps this from feeling like a truly hard-won evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and coherent—her blank performance, morally gray intent, and drive to “cultivate lightness in sorrow” all align with her careful whittling and narration. The contradiction between her emotional void and her chosen role as quiet comforter is interesting, though it never quite sharpens into a high-stakes, on-page dilemma. Her final stance—that this is not rebellion but cultivation—feels earned by prior reflection. However, much of her conflict stays conceptual rather than embodied in hard choices or visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet has a clear motivation—“to stride through boundaries once thought sacred”—and his actions (paraphrasing the chant, walking the colonnade) align with that. However, he reads more as an archetype than an individuated person; his interiority is almost entirely framed in abstractions and gorgeous images rather than concrete, idiosyncratic thoughts. There is little contradiction or visible emotional struggle as he moves from tremor to certainty, so the arc feels smooth rather than hard-won. The closing sense of steadied purpose is pleasant but not deeply earned as character change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Selene’s motivation—to repair or transcend her colorblindness by finding beauty in imperfection—is clear and consistently expressed, and her choices (pairing plants, bartering pigments) align with it. The internal contradiction between craving “perfect symmetry” and learning to love cracks is present but mostly articulated rather than dramatized through hard decisions. Emotional texture is gentle and relatively undifferentiated; she rarely struggles or fails. The final softening of her self-judgment is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell ringer’s curiosity and humility are clear and consistent, and the “powerfully gentle” approach to the chimes gives them some specificity. Motivation—to cultivate connection in the artificial mind—is explicit and coherent. However, interior contradiction is minimal; they never feel genuinely torn or challenged, so the emotional arc remains relatively flat. The closing resolve to continue the ritual feels more like affirmation than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mourning jeweler has a clear, specific arc from desolation to quiet purpose, with embodied details (copper‑stained fingers, grief) grounding her. Her motivation—to remap grief into renewal via intentional ritual—consistently drives her actions. However, internal conflict is smoothed over; once she finds the stencil, her path unfolds with little hesitation or contradictory impulse. The transformation feels earned but relatively low-friction for a “rock bottom” premise.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cartomancer’s core motivation—to decode the crash and find a “blueprint of hope”—is clear and coherently expressed through her tools and rituals. However, her interiority remains largely single-note (reverent, curious, dutiful) with little contradictory impulse or true doubt dramatized in-scene. The “weight of inherited mystery” is told rather than tested by a concrete dilemma or cost. The final acceptance of purpose feels graceful but relatively low-conflict, limiting depth of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian’s driving motive—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is clear and consistent, and his emotional palette (joy/sorrow, nostalgia) feels particular. However, he encounters little real resistance, and we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure; his choice to “abandon certainty” arrives smoothly rather than through dramatized struggle. Interiority leans on repeated abstractions (“anguished joy,” “atoms of nostalgia”) rather than more individuating, embodied specifics. The final shift toward accepting transformation is conceptually sound but not fully earned as a difficult, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The noticer’s core motive—to preserve hope and captured shadows for future wanderers—is clear and consistent, and his actions (moving the stone, studying footage, recording his own act) align with that. However, his interiority leans abstract (“luminous regret,” “gentle certainty”) rather than character-particular, so emotion feels generalized instead of idiosyncratically embodied. Internal conflict is muted; he rarely wavers or faces a meaningful competing impulse. The final acceptance of his “just” task reads earned enough for this length, but the cost is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—repairing both the animal and the moral damage of the con—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (keeping the tail tip until truth is untangled, carefully staging the ritual). Her internal conflict between self‑respect and compassion is present but handled largely through exposition rather than being tested by sharp, on-page dilemmas. Emotional texture is gently specific (“fragile convictions wobble like a candle in wind”) but rarely contradictory under pressure. The change toward renewed resolve is credible, if somewhat easily achieved given the scale of betrayal implied.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator’s motivation as a “closure seeker” is clear and specific, and their choices (descending, returning to the coffee rings, performing the ritual) align coherently with that drive. Interiority is vivid but more conceptual than psychologically layered; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond a generalized yearning for closure. The final shift to “understood that time itself was a wound we could read” feels earned but emotionally cushioned—there’s little visible cost or resistance. Still, the character reads as particular rather than generic, largely through vocation and sensory focus.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal gazer has a clear, particular motivation and a consistent interior texture, even though we mostly infer it through action and image rather than direct thought. Her choices—performing the psychometry, following the mental map, accepting the unused love into herself—track logically with that drive. That said, her inner conflict remains muted: we don’t see much contradiction or resistance as she takes on this emotional weight. The final transformation is earned but feels more serene than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dreamer’s core motive—freeing trapped creativity—is consistent and clearly tied to his actions with the instrument and stars. However, his interiority stays fairly singularly reverent; there’s little contradictory impulse (doubt vs. devotion, fear vs. compulsion) to complicate him. Emotional embodiment leans abstract and cosmic rather than concrete in-body sensations, which flattens some potential depth. The closing shift to seeing rest as cyclical is earned but comes with minimal visible cost or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guard has a clear, consistent motive—rekindling a dead world—and a defined trait in his “dreamless” state, with a modest internal shift toward longing by the end. However, he remains more emblematic than fully individuated, with little contradiction or textured interiority under pressure. Emotional beats are often summarized (“felt a fleeting warmth”) rather than deeply embodied. The closure choice (to keep tending light) feels coherent but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stray philosopher has a clear, consistent motivation and interiority, and his final realization about “internal wilderness” tracks with what’s been seeded. However, he remains more archetype than individuated person, with little contradiction or genuine flaw under pressure. His “change” is mostly an articulated insight rather than a choice that costs him something legible on the page. This keeps the characterization solid but short of truly compelling literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s longing and motive (“to find where unused courage waits”) are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—waiting many evenings, boarding, using the ticket—track plausibly. However, she rarely exhibits live contradiction or real resistance; we don’t see her torn between staying with the memory of the dog and leaving, only a smooth progression toward courage. Emotional states are mostly told in symbolic terms rather than grounded in idiosyncratic, embodied reactions. The ferry guides function more as archetypal figures than as characters exerting psychological pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.0)
    The bellhop has a clear pattern of behavior and one concrete, meaningful choice (placing the bolt), and the guests have a stated motivation, but neither gains much psychological specificity. Interiority is mostly summarized (“Their motivation was simple…”) rather than dramatized in embodied, character-particular ways. The guests function more as a conceptual chorus than individuals, which limits emotional stakes. The final “new understanding” feels thematically neat but not strongly earned through on-page, conflicted micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The titan’s motivation is clear and steady, but his interiority remains generalized; we don’t see contradictory impulses or much embodied emotion when the temple starts collapsing or when he confronts the pretender. His choices (seeking the pellet, using it, touching the crown, pronouncing judgment) track logically, yet they feel ritualized more than pressured. The pretender is almost purely symbolic, offering no character-based resistance. This keeps the arc readable but emotionally thinner than top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara and Eli are clearly sketched and their shared ritual gives them texture, but we rarely see them under real pressure making value-testing choices. Mara’s motivation (bearing witness to coral loss and hidden paths) is consistent yet under-explored in terms of internal contradiction or cost. Emotional states are often conveyed via conceptual phrasing (“periodically eternal”) rather than embodied specifics. The relationship dynamic is more implied than dramatized, so their final glance feels gentle rather than sharply reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stargazer’s motive (to find meaning amid ruins) is clear and her actions—whispering to the stone, tracing glyphs, vowing to keep the flame alive—track consistently with that desire. However, her interiority stays mostly in a lyrical, generalized register rather than exposing specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. The “awkward confidence” never quite manifests as a live tension between fear and boldness in scene. Her closing realization, while thematically apt, edges toward a neat epiphany rather than a change wrestled from genuine inner conflict.

    Anara’s motive and core traits (insurgent, reverent, stubbornly hopeful) are clear and consistent, and her key choice—to sacrifice her youth-memories to unseal the relic—tracks with those traits. However, her internal conflict with the elders’ warning and the risk of calamity is asserted more than dramatized; we rarely feel her doubt or fear. Emotions tend toward elevated summary (“felt a swell of purpose”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final acceptance of the bond with the embryo lands, but with less visible ambivalence or cost than the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The survivor’s interiority is vivid and specific—her relationship to the photograph, wind, and body cues feels lived-in and consistent. Motivation (to live with grief and move forward) is clear and her final stance is earned. However, some phrasing (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism”) flattens emotional contradiction into lightly therapeutic abstraction rather than dramatizing messier, competing impulses. The arc is convincing but could use one sharper on-page moment of conflict between clinging to grief and risking change.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s artistic crisis and crestfallen state are clear and consistent, and his decision to engage with the broken deck rather than discard it feels motivated. The interior shift—from fearing fragmentation to embracing it as his new canvas—is legible and earned enough for this length. However, his emotions are often conveyed via abstracted phrases (“luminescent ache,” “fragmented reality”) rather than grounded, character-particular embodiment, which slightly blunts the sense of a fully individuated psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and persistent—he wants to understand why time slows in crisis—and his “serene anger” gives him a distinct emotional coloration. We see him act on that motive by using the ink and interrogating the patterns, and his final shift from anger to purpose is legible. However, his interiority trends abstract and aphoristic rather than concretely embodied, and contradictory impulses under pressure are only lightly suggested. The arc feels more declared than hard-won, which keeps this below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maren’s core motive (risking herself to spread a contraband truth) is clear and consistent, and the archivist role gives her a specific frame. However, her “bravely conflicted” state is mostly asserted rather than dramatized through on-page hesitation, missteps, or contradictory impulses in the moment of action. The crucial choice—slipping the letter into the conduit—arrives quickly and without evolving pressure or competing alternatives. The ending shows resolve but not a visibly costly internal trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s motivation (“to weave continuity through chaos”) is explicit and her actions consistently serve it—helping the boy, speaking to the roses, organizing the sandbags—but her internal conflict (pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter) is told rather than dramatized. We never see a live temptation toward violence or a meaningful cost to her pacifism. Emotional states are mostly implied through serene images rather than embodied contradictions. The relationship with the boy is tender but one-note, offering little pressure back onto her.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fisher’s motivation—to catch the echo of a goddess—is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it throughout. However, his interiority is largely expressed in generalized, lofty terms (“his mind, a vessel that transliterates emotions into currents”) rather than in concrete, character-specific contradictions. There’s little sense of internal conflict or cost; his “cool-headed” nature remains untested. As a result, the ending registers as a gentle fulfillment rather than an earned, pressured shift in who he is.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s motivation and lineage are clear and specific, and her methodical, almost ritualistic actions (slotting the nib, framing a hypothesis) align tightly with her stated drive to uncover truth. However, she encounters almost no real resistance, and we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or emotional cost as she succeeds. Her devotion to her ancestors and to logic is asserted more than tested, so the final sense of responsibility lands but doesn’t fully burn. The journalist is mostly a cipher and doesn’t significantly pressure or complicate her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra’s core motive—hushing old guilt through sound—is clear and consistent, and her actions (studying the amber, stitching it into the recorder, writing the final letter) align with that drive. However, her interior conflict is more told than dramatized, so we rarely feel competing impulses in real time. The emotional shift at the end (her dissonance loosening) is plausible but arrives as a summary rather than a hard-fought on-page choice. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora’s motivation (“to discover meaning in the mess of scattered thoughts”) is clear and her actions align with it, and we get a credible internal shift from unease to curiosity. However, her interiority is largely thematic rather than character-particular, with little contradiction or real struggle on the page. The violinist at the end is evocative but thinly sketched, functioning more as an echo than as a pressured character. The change carries minimal visible cost, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gentle radical has a clear mission and an interior shift from retrocognitive entrapment to fulfilled purpose, but his psychology remains more emblematic than individuated. His emotions are largely carried by setting and diction rather than specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. Actions align with stated motives, yet we rarely see genuine struggle or costly hesitation. The final ease with which he accepts his role keeps the character arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    The ghost’s core longing for an encore and eventual acceptance of peace are clear and consistent, and his synesthetic perceptions give him some specificity. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: there’s little sense of competing impulses (clinging to applause vs. letting go) playing out in scene. The shopkeeper is mostly a device, with minimal characterization beyond “weary” and receptive. The final shift to “realized his purpose” reads more declared than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s curiosity, skepticism, and tenderness toward “wonder” are clear and consistent, and her actions (experimenting, recording, sending data) track well with those traits. However, internal conflict stays mostly conceptual—her “affection for doubt” softens without much dramatized struggle or costly choice. Embodied emotion appears (somatic markers, faint whisper of another mind) but her psyche never feels under real pressure. The final sense of purpose is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The map maker’s vocation and motivation are clear and particular, and her actions consistently express her desire “to become the voice of the unknown.” However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or genuine internal conflict; her realization at the end largely confirms what she already believes rather than forcing a costly choice. Interiority stays mostly at the level of purpose and observation rather than embodied, pressured emotion. The endurance/change at the end is credible but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara’s motivation (to decode the prophecy and responsibly “turn time”) is clear and consistent, and her profession as an hourglass turner is nicely integrated with her actions. However, she faces almost no resistance—internal or external—so her choices rarely feel pressured or conflicted. Her realizations (“the shared wisdom was not a static lesson but a living conversation”) arrive smoothly, without being earned through genuine struggle. The arc reads more like a steady unfolding of a foregone role than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The burned spy has clear motivation (guilt, desire for redemption) and a consistent inner drive, but we mostly get this in declarative form rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. His choices—following the snow codes, drinking the vials, entering the pass—are aligned and relatively untroubled, so we rarely see competing impulses. Emotional states are evoked more through setting metaphor than embodied specifics. The final change in him is legible but feels somewhat preordained and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arlen’s motive—to translate the river’s layered memory into a “single, clean stitch of understanding”—is clear and consistently embodied in his attention to fog, sound, and the needle. His interiority is specific and textured rather than generic, and the maternal association with the needle adds dimension. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he moves from intention to fulfillment without much visible struggle or competing impulse. The change into a lighter heart at the end feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s characterization as a zen‑minded potter is specific and consistent, with believable, tactile engagement in her work and environment. Her motivation—to understand the oasis and offer kindness—is clear and drives all her actions. However, internal conflict is minimal; she rarely experiences contradictory impulses or visible doubt, which flattens potential complexity. The final shift feels more like a serene realization than a choice with strongly felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara has a clear, gentle motive (to bring light/safety) and a consistent temperament, and her gardening actions align with that. However, interior conflict is very soft; “protected vulnerability” and “pragmatic hope” are asserted more than dramatized in contradictory impulses. Her choice to plant the vines is essentially pre-decided, so the arc reads as enactment rather than pressured decision. The endurance/renunciation cost is minimal and mostly conceptual, so her final peace feels earned but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s core motivation—to turn isolation into independence via communion with the sky-whale memory—is clear and consistent, and her choices (performing the ritual, leaving with the sundial, vowing to others) align with it. However, her inner life is more declarative than conflicted; we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle. The transition from reverent researcher to confident bridge-builder is plausible but smoothed, with little visible cost beyond effort and awe. The characterization is strong for a lyric piece, but not yet at a “flawed, pressured, and internally divided” literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira’s core motivation (finding “the thread that connects all things”) is clear and consistent, and her choice to step onto the spiral and accept her role gives her a modest arc. However, her interiority remains largely serene and unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk in accepting or rejecting the role of “keeper of secrets.” Emotions are largely implied through atmosphere rather than embodied contradiction, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional. The final “content” acceptance reads a bit frictionless for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s role and motives are clear and consistent, and her technical competence comes through, but she lacks real contradiction or vulnerability under pressure. The “cautiously hopeful” trait is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices with cost. Her victory over the tricksters is so smooth that we see little emotional degradation or genuine struggle. The absence of an on-page relationship crucible (the dean and students mostly act off-stage) limits dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The explorer’s core contradiction—claustrophobic yet “prudently adventurous”—is clear and dramatized in his choice to enter and continue through the shifting tunnel. Motivation (retrieve the key) is steady and coherent, and his fear is at least partially embodied in breath-tightening and chest-weight imagery. However, much of his emotional life is rendered in elevated abstraction rather than concrete, idiosyncratic perception, which blunts the sense of a fully particular individual. The final realization about stories feels a bit authorial and generalized rather than uniquely his.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s core drive (using her face-blindness and tactile perception to recover erased victims) is clear and interesting, and her emotional shift from numbed distance to renewed empathy lands. However, her inner conflict is more declared than dramatized; we’re told her empathy was dormant, but don’t see many contradictory impulses in action. Her methodical nature and refusal to see faces are sketched rather than truly tested under pressure. The final “awakening” feels somewhat preordained, with limited visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s blend of “nervously confident” and duty-bound idealism is consistent and embodied (“a coat stitched from hope and dread”), and her motivation to honor her ancestor cleanly drives each choice. Internal conflict between fear and resolve is clear, especially in the descent to the chamber and the decision to stay during the vortex. Her arc from dread to purposeful resolve is earned, though the emotional cost of that shift could be shaded with a bit more ambivalence. Secondary characters (the crew) exist only as a summarized mass, so no relational crucible develops on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The fiddler has a clear desire (redeem the vanished hitchhiker and later all “lost travelers”) and some embodied emotion (“heart hammered with luminous disbelief”), but he remains more emblematic than fully human. His choices—following the fluttering map, playing at the summit, vowing a quest—are motivated yet almost frictionless. There’s little sense of internal contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. The arc from private shock to public mission is present but not deeply earned on the level of psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s history as a highway robber’s son, his foreign-money fetish, and his measured role inside LoopForge cohere into a distinct, convincing character. His calm is particularized through action (the way he reassures Maya, rides out the crash, and returns to the train) rather than pure label. However, his internal conflict remains relatively muted; the pull between inheriting violence and choosing structure is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in difficult choices. The final repricing of his father’s legacy feels earned but a touch tidy, with limited on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s vocation and sensibility are clear and coherent, and her motives (to decode the inscriptions, to honor the telegram’s injunction) are consistently carried through. However, she encounters little genuine resistance; doubt is mentioned but not dramatized as active internal conflict. Her shift from burdened to relieved feels more like an effortless wash of reassurance than a hard-won change. The piece would benefit from at least one moment where her impulses genuinely clash or a costful choice is foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The druid’s core motive—to free and protect the confession—is clear and consistent, and her “warlike serenity” maps credibly onto her actions. However, interior conflict is muted: she never seems genuinely torn between the seed’s danger and her task, and her shift from “guarded” to “open” is asserted more than earned. Emotional states are often summarized in elevated language instead of embodied through concrete, character-specific reactions. The result is a solid but not deeply textured characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The visionary’s motivation—to locate and unlock the eclipsed covenant so she can guide her people—is clear and consistently pursued, and her emotions are sensibly embodied (“anxious elation,” the hedge’s shiver, the cool weight of the clipping). However, she reads more as an archetypal seer than a fully individuated person, with little contradiction or moral friction on the page. The absence of real internal conflict or visible personal cost at the climax keeps her arc from feeling fully earned. Her final resolve comes smoothly rather than as something wrestled from competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maelia’s central drive—to mend the “holes in her soul” with the orchard’s roots—is clear and consistent, and her actions track with that motive. However, the touted “reckless idealism” and “fiercely gentle” traits rarely come under pressure, so we don’t see real internal contradiction or cost on the page. Emotional states are often stated via elevated diction rather than dramatized in specific, character-particular moments. The closing shift toward renewed purpose is believable but feels more like confirmation than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s shame, history as a roadie, and meticulous appraiser’s mind are specific and consistent, with good interiority (“I began insulating emotionally with facts…”). Internal conflict between craving applause and needing a quieter purpose is clear, though it’s articulated more than dramatized. Emotional responses skew slightly toward reflective/therapeutic language (“rebirth,” “purpose after loss”) rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The closing shift toward “a new kind of stage” feels earned but a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s motivation (understanding the “physics of transition”) is clear and consistent, and her occupation and temperament feel specific, but she faces little on-page contradiction or pressure. The “haunted ambitions” are mostly summarized rather than dramatized, so we don’t see her genuinely torn between old habits and new compassion. Her final decision to journey to the valleys is coherent but lightly earned because almost nothing resists her. This yields a solid but not deeply transformative character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The titan-gear librarian’s motive—to preserve wonder in routine—is clear and consistently dramatized through his choices (forging the key, opening the new shelf, sealing the creel). His interiority is more archetypal than psychologically granular, but the internal shift—recognizing his own identity must migrate—is earned by prior images of tides and moon phases. Emotional experience is conveyed mostly through perception and symbolic action rather than embodied feeling, which keeps him slightly abstract. Still, his decisions track cleanly with the story’s pressures and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s core motive—to dissolve walls between hearts—is clear and consistent, and her shift from “inspector” to “keeper of light” feels earned by the ritual she performs. However, she rarely exhibits live contradictory impulses or visible struggle; once in the cave, she mainly enacts a foregone conclusion. The bunker-inspector identity is more label than pressure on her choices. Emotional embodiment is present but leans generalized (“trembling fingers,” “guarded heart”) rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator is psychologically coherent and particular—a “truth‑seeking river chronicler” with a tactile relationship to objects and place, and a clearly stated drive for self‑forgiveness. Motivation is sustained and visible in micro-choices (following the graffiti, entering the tunnel, drawing the map, vowing to return). Internal conflict—shame and hope, self-judgment and yearning—is present but somewhat smoothed; there are few moments where contradictory impulses collide sharply in scene. The stopping of medication is evocative but under-embodied, functioning more as a tag than an active constraint on behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation (to find the library) is clear and steady, but the narrator’s interiority stays narrow—“cautious exuberance” doesn’t deepen into real contradiction or doubt. The veiled dreamer is more emblematic than individuated, and their relationship never quite becomes a crucible. Actions all align with the desire to explore, yet almost nothing genuinely tests their values or forces a hard choice. The final vow to document every petal reads more like a continuation of the same impulse than an earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—her “mulberry ache” and archival mindset feel character-particular, and her choice to side with the vines is well-rooted in prior beats. Internal conflict (dream vs empire, duty vs grief) is present but not deeply torn; she leans quickly toward rebellion once the warning appears. The envoy exists more as a symbolic foil than a fully pressured character, which keeps the relational crucible relatively soft. The final choice carries emotional cost but not a strongly dramatized sense of sacrifice or self-contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s vocation and devotion are clear and particular, and her belief in “finding patterns in static” gives her some individual texture. However, she encounters almost no resistance, and we see little internal contradiction or emotional cost as she performs the ritual. Her role as beautician mortician is evocative but under-exploited for character pressure. The ending offers endurance and resolve, but without much sense of what it costs her personally beyond solemn duty.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motives (caretaking, seeking contentment after betrayal) are clear and coherent, but most of the real conflict—“forgiving the unforgivable”—happens off-page. Her interiority is pleasant yet generalized, with little live contradiction or messy emotion under pressure. The major realization about contentment feels more like an affirmation than a hard-won, costly turn. Overall she’s consistent and likeable, but lacks the layered, in-scene struggle needed for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s role and interior stance are clear and specific—“conscience for hire” with a practiced insincerity—but her inner conflict stays largely conceptual rather than dramatically pressured. We’re told she carries others’ guilt and has her own doubts, yet those contradictions never force a hard, costly choice on the page. The magistrate exists mostly as a projected image and abstract will, so relational dynamics and status shifts remain underdeveloped. Her final contentment feels plausible but not deeply earned through escalating, character-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation (turning her reverse aging from curse to gift) is clear and consistent, and her methodical, contemplative nature is well-drawn. However, her internal conflict around the paradox of “waiting while age peeled away in reverse” is more stated than dramatized in on-page choices under pressure. The final realization in the grotto lands, but it feels relatively tidy and low-cost, more contemplative reframe than hard-won pivot. The piece would benefit from at least one moment where her desire to know now genuinely strains her resolve to withhold.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    The skimmer’s motivation (to navigate without moving, to honor history) is clear and consistent, and her sensory relationship to the canyon and pulse gives her some specificity. However, she faces little real resistance, and there’s almost no internal contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. Her “weathered resolve” reads as stable from start to finish, so the closing stance feels like confirmation rather than a costly evolution. The reverence gesture toward past travelers hints at depth but isn’t tested in a way that would reveal more complex flaws or priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selric’s motivation—seeking the sacred in the simple while feeling like an underachiever—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (unstrapping the spellbook, choosing to mist walk, touching the keystone, then descending) align with that. The internal contradiction between doubt and quiet purpose is present but mostly told rather than dramatized through resistant impulses at peak beats. His transformation from “underachieving mage” to someone who accepts a quieter, truer measure of brilliance is credible but a bit too frictionless. The emotional embodiment is largely atmospheric rather than rooted in specific bodily reaction, which keeps him slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s core motivation—to discover the color of sound—is clear, consistent, and nicely tied to his history with the train’s thunder, but his inner life remains relatively simple and unconflicted. Interiority is poetic but not deeply particular; we don’t see contradictory impulses or meaningful fear, only quiet resolve. His choices (leaving the pier, using the key, opening the book, accepting the sigil) align with his goal but never visibly cost him anything. The final vow reads earned in mood, but not as a hard-won personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    Silas’s motivation—“to wavelength align with purpose”—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to his behavior with the coins and static. However, his interiority leans abstract and ceremonial rather than embodied and particular, so we don’t feel much visceral contradiction or cost as he pursues that goal. The shift at the end from seeking purpose as destination to accepting it as frequency is coherent but emotionally under-dramatized. This reads as a strong, if somewhat generalized, character study rather than a fully cutting psychological portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation—transforming nameless fears into named, containable beings—is clear and consistent, and it organically drives every on-page choice. Her grief is particularized (the half-remembered sailor, ancestral burden) rather than generic, and the final shift from heartbroken to quietly released feels earned by the ritual of naming. However, we rarely see simultaneity of contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves toward the solution with very little visible resistance or self-sabotage. The emotional journey is convincing but somewhat smoothed, with limited felt cost at the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    The mage’s motivation (to right a cosmic imbalance by rebuilding the bell) is clear, consistent, and carries through to the end. His traits—lukewarm magic, earnest naivety, brittle devotion—are specific and reflected in his chosen method. However, internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than dramatized; he never seriously doubts or makes a costly trade-off. His final realization about brittle devotion feels earned but emotionally modest rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Caitlyn’s role and core motivation (to clear the myth and honor a tradition of “quiet observation”) are clear and consistent, but she encounters no real internal contradiction or visible struggle. Her emotional life is mostly inferred from the lyric atmosphere rather than dramatized in specific, pressured micro-choices. The community is a faceless collective with no individuated counterpressure or dissent. The final “calm certainty” feels earned enough for this quiet piece but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    Selene’s goal and temperament are clear and coherent, and her sentimental streak pays off in the firefly memory when the “touch of wonder” finally lands. However, she encounters almost no real resistance, so we don’t see her values tested under pressure. Her internal contradiction—rigid mind vs hidden heart—is stated more than dramatized through conflicting impulses in-scene. The final shift to harmony feels earned enough but emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    The seeker’s sense of responsibility and competence are clear, and his choice to climb and repair the harness is well-motivated. However, he faces little real internal contradiction or degradation under stress; the “watcher’s burden” is asserted more than dramatized in conflicting impulses. The emotional cost is described as lifting “fractionally,” but concrete, character-specific struggle is muted. The outpost crew’s presence at the end adds only a light externalizing of his arc rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—to cure his emotional numbness via the Duplicate—is clear and consistent, and the paradox-blade device reflects a credible internal contradiction (calm vs fury, compassion vs resolve). However, his internal struggle is largely asserted rather than dramatized; we are told he lets opposites clash until they merge, but we don’t see a moment where he nearly chooses otherwise or visibly falters. The factions are essentially flat abstractions (Guardians/Syndicate) and don’t deepen his characterization. The ending shift toward quiet pride is earned enough to work, but it feels low-cost and slightly tidy for the weight of “ego death survivor.”

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara’s curiosity and drive to innovate are clear and consistent, and her professional lens as an escape room designer gives her choices some specificity. However, her interiority remains generalized—more idea-driven than person-specific—and we rarely see embodied, contradictory emotion under pressure. The participants are a faceless group, so no relational crucible or status dynamics ever come into play. The final “triumph” beat feels emotionally thin because there has been little genuine struggle or cost dramatized on the way there.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conductor’s driving motive—transforming grief-silence into laughter—reads clearly and consistently, and “mournfully eager” feels particular. However, he remains largely an archetype or function (ritualist, psychopomp of laughter) rather than an individuated person with history, blind spots, or conflicting impulses on the page. The only hint of contradiction (“still mourning yet eager to heal”) is asserted rather than dramatized through costly choices. His emotional state is embodied in images and actions, but never really pressured or complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The guardian’s longing, patience, and curiosity are clear and consistent, and her shift from “feral” to “curator” is legible and earned by prior beats. However, her interior conflict with uncertainty is mostly stated rather than dramatized moment-to-moment, so contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page. The emotional life leans conceptual (“dimensionally homesick,” “make friends with uncertainty”) rather than concretely embodied. The final stance feels right for the piece, but the cost of that stance is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices around refining the elixirs track logically with his belief in “creative destruction.” However, his interiority leans toward a single, solemn register—“hopeless yet quietly purposeful”—with little contradictory impulse or genuine doubt dramatized in scene. The shift from hopelessness to purpose at the end feels earned but somewhat low-cost because we never see him nearly fail or truly waver. More embodied, conflicted emotional beats under pressure would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    Selin’s motivations (pragmatic, anti-nostalgic, data-first) are clear and consistent, and her choices to treat the shard as a tool rather than an idol track cleanly through the piece. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or emotional cost; her worldview is affirmed rather than tested. Interiority is more conceptual than embodied, so we rarely feel her in a stressed body. The closing “arc” is essentially confirmation of what she already believes rather than a pressured change or earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lio’s core motivation (merging timelines, rescuing vanished passengers) is clear and consistent, and his actions track with that aim. However, his interiority remains thinly sketched; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. His “resiliently positive” trait is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in costly choices. The closing satisfaction feels earned enough for this length but emotionally low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The architect has a clear, consistent motivation and a distinct interior texture, but he rarely meets resistance, so we don’t see him under real pressure or contradiction. His “unsettling calm” never fractures or complicates into genuine conflict, which flattens potential depth. The final realization feels like an extension of his original purpose rather than a change that extracts visible cost. As a character study, it’s evocative but too frictionless for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s motivation and professional focus are clear and consistent, and details like her nightly observation-deck ritual give her some specificity. However, her “balancedly curious” temperament is told more than dramatized, and we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or costed dilemma on the page. The key beats (test voyage, promise at the statue) register as reaffirmations rather than pressured choices. This keeps the characterization effective but short of the depth and complexity expected at a top literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator’s core motives—persistent curiosity and a duty to protect vulnerable voices—are clear and consistent, and his choices (following the signal, entering the alcove, making the promise) align with them. However, his interiority remains largely declarative and idealized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine uncertainty under pressure. The “incidental heroism” is asserted more than tested, as he encounters little resistance and pays no evident cost. This keeps the character from feeling fully particular or complex enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motive (to “stand by the unremembered”) is clearly stated, and her fear of tight spaces is named, but the claustrophobia doesn’t substantively affect her behavior once she’s inside. Interiority is largely descriptive rather than conflicted; we don’t see competing impulses seriously tested when she risks the phase transition. The endpoint—her “claustrophobic heart finally at ease”—is conceptually nice but under-earned because we haven’t watched her struggle with or nearly succumb to that flaw in scene. She functions more as a carrier of atmosphere and premise than as a fully pressured, idiosyncratic psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation (to fix the digital ghost and reclaim her own life from a bureaucratic death) is clear and consistent, and her technical competence reads credibly. However, her internal conflict is relatively muted; she moves from unease to solace without much on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse. The most revealing beat is the recognition that the ghost is “not a threat but a mirror,” but this realization comes smoothly, without her having to wrestle with a harder, riskier alternative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The storyteller’s motivation—preserving a dying language by translating texture into sound—is clear and consistent, and his actions track with that aim. However, his interior life is more stated than dramatized; we’re told his purpose and legacy-weight, but we don’t see much contradiction, doubt, or emotional friction around using a cursed object. The copper veins and “quietly articulate” trait are evocative but don’t generate nuanced internal conflict. The final smile feels earned enough, but the cost to him personally remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator’s professional motive (cryptid researcher with a specific brief) is clear and consistent, and the final repricing of the “beast” into a song gives them a modest arc from suspicion to partnership. However, interiority stays fairly generalized—there’s little contradiction or real struggle, and emotional beats like “the bitterness inside me loosen” feel asserted rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. The mission never forces a difficult trade-off or a visible cost beyond relinquishing the arrowhead, which itself doesn’t feel psychologically fraught. Stronger, more idiosyncratic reactions under pressure would deepen character and make the closing shift feel more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear—he yearns to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world—but interiority remains archetypal rather than specific, with little sense of contradictory impulses or embodied fear. His emotional experience is mostly summarized via yearning and longing without sharp, character-particular textures. The statues’ shift from enforcers to guardians is nicely motivated by curiosity cracking their stone resolve, but their inner life is only lightly sketched. The closing vow to travel feels thematically apt yet emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Milo’s motivation—to foster a fragile peace—is clear and consistent, and his “respectfully rebellious” stance tracks through his choices. However, his interiority leans thematic and abstract (“He knew that broken promises could only heal…”) rather than character-particular. We get little contradictory impulse or lived specificity beyond his function in the allegory. The closing shift to “quiet purpose” works but feels more stated than earned through complex internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara’s motive and function are clear—she listens to silence and revives the circus—but she reads more as an archetype or priestess of hush than as a particular, conflicted person. Her choices (repairing the horse, descending the staircase, placing the fragment) are consistent but almost frictionless, with no visible cost or competing impulse. Interiority is mostly thematic insight rather than embodied, character-specific feeling. The final realization about her “true craft” lands more as authorial thesis than as hard-won, contradictory self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara has a distinct presence and worldview, but her motivation is more stated than dramatized under pressure, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or real cost around her stewardship. Her “sanely eccentric” quality mostly manifests as aesthetic (the scarf, her habits) rather than as a trait that complicates choices. The internal moments (recalling the lecture, feeling the tug of memory) are evocative but emotionally cool, more conceptual than embodied. The closing decision to tuck the scarf away and log the event reads as a continuation of her role rather than a meaningful shift or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation (to capture the runaway dream/pearl) is clear and consistent, and her interiority around longing, light, and books feels particular to her. However, she faces very little real pressure or contradiction on the page—her choices aren’t hard, and we don’t see competing impulses in conflict. Lio is more of an emblem than a fully realized person. The final “change” (understanding longing as a bridge) is thematically apt but not strongly earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his inner life remains largely abstract, with little sense of contradictory impulses or real cost. Lines like “guided by a faint longing that felt both impossible and inevitable” gesture toward complexity without dramatizing struggle. His success comes too cleanly, so the shift from longing to confidence feels asserted rather than earned. The absence of another on-page character further limits opportunities to reveal depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The folklorist’s motivation (recovering village memories) is clear and rooted in her profession and temperament, and her methods feel character-specific. However, she encounters almost no resistance, so we learn little about her limits, flaws, or contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority tends toward clean, confident insight rather than conflicted emotion. The implied long-arc change (“decades later…”) feels more like retrospective framing than an earned on-page shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s motivation—mentoring resilience and ending the library’s exile—is clear and consistently embodied in her actions, especially the gentle yet determined way she treats damaged books. Her nervous habit of walking backward and her “combative tenderness” give her particularity and some internal contradiction, culminating in her shift from retreat to steady forward movement. However, her inner conflict remains relatively low-stakes and mostly aligned with the plot goal; she rarely seems truly torn or at risk of failing herself. The final stance feels earned but not deeply costly or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pruner has a clear, consistent motivation (preserving “the color of wonder”) and a few concrete choices (planting the seed on water, singing to the storm, giving the traveler a sprig). However, he remains largely an archetype without textured interiority or credible contradiction; we’re told he is “insatiably creative” but never see that create friction or error. Emotional states are mostly implied through the lyrical setting rather than embodied in his body or thoughts. The lack of on-page cost or ambivalence in his decisions keeps his arc from feeling earned or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear and consistent—she restores masks and grounds spirits—but her emotional life remains largely at the level of serene competence. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or real risk to her, so her “calm resolve” at the end feels like continuation rather than earned change. Micro-choices (which knot, how to proceed) are described more as ritual than pressured decisions. The result is evocative but not yet psychologically deep.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation and interior stance (“interpret silence with empathy,” “shielded openness”) are clear and consistent, and her actions—setting up the projector, tracing glyphs, aligning images—flow logically from those traits. However, she faces little resistance and exhibits limited internal contradiction, so we don’t see her values tested under real pressure. The emotional life is more implied by atmosphere than dramatized in specific, embodied conflicts.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mort’s motive (to retrieve and understand the last transmission and the “physics of letting go”) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with that quiet, methodical temperament. However, he reads more as a vessel for theme than as a fully individuated person, with little contradiction or concrete flaw beyond melancholy curiosity. His emotions are largely abstracted into conceptual language rather than embodied responses to the eerie, dangerous environment. The final acceptance feels earned enough but remains more intellectual than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The balladeer’s purpose is clear and consistently enacted, but he remains more archetype than individuated person, with little contradictory interiority or felt cost. His emotional experience is mostly inferred from the imagery rather than embodied on the page. The ghost’s consciousness is sketched conceptually but not deeply characterized as a distinct presence. The final mutual recognition has power, yet it lands more as thematic fulfillment than as a hard-earned, character-specific transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The servant’s core motivation (“to seek out the joy beneath anguish”) is clear and consistent, and his “affectionate detachment” gives him a recognizable emotional stance. However, he encounters little genuine resistance, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or pressured micro-choices. His emotions are more described than embodied, which keeps him somewhat abstract. The closing recommitment feels earned but almost costless.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s motive—to memorialize the night and prove that “empty spaces remember”—is clear and consistently expressed through her actions (categorizing clouds, inscribing the telescope, logging the comet). However, she remains largely a single tonal note of reverent grief and purpose; we see little contradiction or genuine internal struggle under pressure. Her choices are more ritualistic than pressured, so the final “smile” reads earned but without marked cost. Strong, coherent, but not yet at the psychologically layered level of top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s core drive (to “mirror the sky inside walls” before demolition) is clear and consistent, and her face blindness plus “fractally precise” hands give her a distinct interior lens. However, her emotional life remains somewhat generalized—there’s little contradiction or embodied struggle under time pressure, so the final “defiance” feels more stated than hard-won. The realization about limits being thresholds is thematically apt but arrives as a clean abstraction rather than something messier she wrestles with on the page. Micro-choices exist (using the coin, hiding the safe) but they don’t force painful tradeoffs that would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira is clearly sketched as diligently curious and methodical, and her actions consistently follow from that trait. However, she experiences almost no internal contradiction or visible emotional cost—there’s little sense of fear, doubt, or competing impulses as she manipulates the ship’s “life-force.” The result is competent but somewhat one-note characterization, with endurance rather than change at the end. This limits the depth needed for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The locksmith’s core motivation (“to learn the rhythm of repair”) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it throughout. However, his emotional life remains relatively one-note—nostalgic, reverent, quietly hopeful—with little contradiction or visible internal struggle in peak beats. The key decision moments (opening the box, engaging the key, placing the gear) are executed almost without hesitation or doubt. The ending registers a gentle deepening rather than a felt-cost change in his character.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s altruism and trustworthiness are clear and consistent, and the community’s response to her chalk messages is well-motivated, but interior contradiction and felt cost are thin. She “feels a strange surge of trust in the humans,” which hints at change, yet we never see a real risk or doubt she must push through. The villagers function more as a unified chorus than as individuated agents under pressure. The final promise to keep the bell ringing reads more ceremonial than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s role, history with the dying sailor, and embodied responses (“hands trembled,” “cracks mending”) give her a coherent inner life, but she remains more archetypal vessel than fully conflicted person. Her motivation to pause the world’s ticking is clear and consistent, yet we rarely see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. The key choice—to perform the ritual—is never meaningfully in question, so the emotional cost reads muted. The closing self-understanding about being “beautifully flawed” is earned enough but not deeply contended on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The caretaker’s reluctance, sense of obligation, and ambivalent satisfaction are clear and consistent, especially in lines like “chosen not for love but for a bargain” and “a bitter sweetness that settles like ash on my tongue.” However, interior conflict is more declared than dramatized; we’re told it’s not selfish and that the beauty is graceless, but we rarely see live, contradictory impulses colliding in specific moments. The key choice—placing the nut—is treated as inevitable rather than pressured, which softens the felt cost of that decision. Overall the character feels particular, but the emotional arc could deepen through more embodied, in-scene hesitation or compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation—atonement for a failed experiment—clearly drives her choices from ravine to lab, and the polymer/lattice thinking feels specific to her profession and temperament. Her emotional life is embodied (foam, heartbeat, tactile engagement with water) rather than merely labeled. However, internal conflict is fairly low-friction: guilt converts into purpose with little resistance, and we rarely see genuinely competing impulses in the moment. The arc is convincing but tidy rather than deeply thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The vendor’s core motive is stated and consistent, but we get almost no textured interiority or contradiction beyond serene purpose. His emotional journey—from questing to “purpose fulfilled”—is told rather than dramatized through embodied reaction or difficult choice. The child is essentially a symbolic function with no individual presence or conflict. As a result, the final understanding feels conceptually apt but not psychologically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lir’s motive (to ease collective remorse) is clear and consistent, and his specialized perception (tasting memories as flavor) gives him a distinct interior lens. However, his emotional experience remains mostly conceptual and metaphorical rather than embodied; we don’t feel contradictory impulses or genuine doubt. The process unfolds without visible strain on him—no fear of being overwhelmed, no temptation to keep or reject certain memories—so his arc reads as steady competence rather than pressured change. The final stance feels more like a successful procedure than a choice with clear personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The librarian’s motivation is clear and consistent—heal the city by “construct[ing] bridges from silos”—but she reads more as a thematic emblem than a fully conflicted person. There is no real internal tension or contradictory impulse; “empathetically decisive” is stated twice but never tested by a hard choice or visible cost. Emotional states are largely summarized (“vigorous tenderness,” “murmurs of gratitude”) rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The ending confirms her success without complicating her flawlessness, which flattens character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and specific—she wants to be an “archeologist of abandoned dreams”—and her actions align cleanly with that goal. We get a distinct cognitive flavor (equations, calibration, treating rock as neural tissue), but internal contradiction and live doubts are muted, so pressure never really exposes fault lines in her character. Her emotional journey is largely linear awe and determination rather than a conflicted progression. The final acceptance of her role feels earned but comes without much visible cost or inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and specific, and her occupational identity as archivist nicely colors her choices. However, her interiority remains largely single-vector—curiosity and duty—without much on-page ambivalence or contradiction under pressure. The “latent blaze” registers as a consistent trait more than a conflicted arc. The final commitment to vigilance feels earned but low-cost, with little sense of what she sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    Auris’s core motivation—to create music in a silent world via empathy—is clear and consistent, and his actions align with that drive. However, his interiority remains idealized and largely unconflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a meaningful personal cost to his quest. The hedgehog and owls function more as witnesses than as pressures that complicate his choices. The closing realization feels earned but relatively easy because no deep flaw or risk is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tutor’s longing, precision, and exile are clearly motivated and consistent, and his interior lens on chess-as-cosmos feels particular. However, his emotions skew abstract and contemplative rather than embodied, with little sense of contradictory impulses in the moment. The exile’s cost is mostly gestured at, not freshly dramatized on the page. The final shift to seeing the covenant as a “paused conversation” is believable but arrives more as idea than hard-won, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to catalog silences as a route to empathy—is clear and consistent, and his theatricality gives him a distinctive flavor. However, we see almost no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his success feels foregone once the ritual starts. Emotional states are often implied through symbolism rather than embodied response, which flattens him somewhat into an emblem. The final vow lands, but without a visible personal cost it reads more like confirmation of what we already knew than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira’s motivation—to “cultivate serenity within motion”—is clearly articulated and consistent, and her actions (taking the seed, planting, tending, ritualizing) align with that drive. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or genuine emotional struggle; she never doubts, fails, or pays much of a price. The “balance of hope and humility” is asserted but not really tested in scene. Her final stance feels like an affirmation of what she already believed rather than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mira’s motivation (complete her vital mission) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a pilot/researcher is well established. However, she remains largely functional rather than deeply individualized; we learn little about her beyond professionalism and curiosity. There is almost no internal contradiction or emotional cost as she succeeds. The closing realization about “listening to the gathering of echoes” reads more as conceptual than as an emotionally earned personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motivation (to understand and dissipate the storm’s residual energy) is clear and her professional competence is well-rendered through tools and methods. However, she faces no real internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she moves from observation to solution without doubt or cost. Emotional embodiment is mostly externalized into the environment and instruments, leaving her inner stakes somewhat abstract. The ending shift feels more like confirmation of what she already believed than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bell ringer has a clear, particularized motive (to “certify wonder as essential”) and a distinctive perceptual world, but she undergoes almost no on-page struggle or contradictory impulse. Her actions—enter, unfurl sheet, sing, leave—are serene and unresisted, so the final sense of purpose feels more affirmed than earned. Emotional embodiment leans abstract (“aware that her purpose was…”) rather than grounded in conflicting bodily responses under pressure. This keeps the character from feeling fully tested or changed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation as a “driven relic keeper” seeking “insights from failure” is clear and consistent, and her ritual actions (uncasing relics, arranging driftwood, playing the flute) align with that drive. However, she meets no real resistance, so we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or pressured micro-choices beyond a generalized sense of solemn resolve. Her realization about the old keepers’ mistake is more conceptual than emotionally embodied, which keeps the arc a bit abstract. The endurance/cost of her new mission is asserted rather than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mara’s core motivation—to understand the “mathematics of emotion”—is clear and consistently aligned with her actions, and the letterpress/borrowed-personality angle gives her a distinct texture. However, her interiority is largely conceptual rather than embodied; we’re told her beliefs and aims more than we feel concrete, conflicting impulses. There’s little genuine struggle on the page: she never meaningfully doubts, fails, or pays a visible emotional price for this work. The ending realization about ongoing self-disorientation functions as an arc but feels more stated than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The courier has a clear, consistent desire (to coax wonder) and a few grounding traits (“jittery,” trained by a mentor), but he rarely feels pressured or internally conflicted. His emotions are mostly summarized as serene satisfaction at performing “tiny miracles,” with little contradiction or cost. The shepherd and the girl function more as receptors for wonder than as full characters. The final sense of him as a quiet myth-maker is graceful but emotionally underpowered for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and particular—an empiricist mystic trying to prove an emotional property of objects—and her inner contradiction between “ancient rituals” and “firmly grounded in empirical study” is dramatized rather than merely stated. Her emotional progression from skepticism to acceptance and then to a sense of responsibility feels earned. However, her struggle never quite sharpens into a difficult, value-testing choice; she succeeds without much visible internal resistance or mistake. The final vow lands, but the cost of carrying the prism’s sorrow is more asserted than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation (send a promise across distance) is clear and consistent, and her loom-centric worldview gives some individuality. However, her interior conflict around “latent sacrifice” is mostly told in generalized terms rather than dramatized through concrete, contradictory impulses in specific beats. The sense of what she actually gives up remains vague, which softens the felt cost of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blacksmith’s motivation is clear and consistent—from haunted failure toward "future strength"—and his key choices (bartering his memory, forging the rebuilding blade) arise organically from that drive. His emotional life is rendered in a concrete, if somewhat generalized, way ("twin horizon of hope and doubt"), with some nice specificity in the sacrificed first failed forge. However, his inner conflict never quite sharpens into a difficult dilemma, and the villagers remain purely functional, offering no relational pressure. The final stance shift to "silent sentinel" feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lira’s motivation and vocation are vivid and specific, and her actions track cleanly with her goal. However, she encounters little genuine resistance—internal or external—so we see limited contradiction or moral struggle despite the grave revelation. The choice to “unmake the cycle” feels emotionally under-tested, with minimal on-page hesitation or cost. Strong concept of character, but not yet emotionally or psychologically maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marek’s motivation—to recreate and protect a feeling of safety from childhood voyages—is clear and consistently expressed through his ritual and care for the sea glass. His interiority is particular (stones as “silent punctuation to an anonymous letter chain”), giving him a distinct sensibility. However, there is little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he rarely feels truly torn or under pressure. The final “surge of purpose” feels earned but low-cost, more affirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s role and purpose are clear and consistent, and her final vow credibly crystallizes her motivation, but her interiority remains relatively thin and unconflicted for the stakes implied. The “weight of centuries” and her paradoxical emotions are told more than embodied, so we don’t feel a sharp internal struggle between impulses. The relationship with the storm herald has texture (his “thunder and mirth,” her solemn purpose), yet status and emotional dynamics between them stay largely static. The ending choice feels emotionally appropriate but not particularly costly or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira has a clear motivation (to understand why some people magnetize stories) and a distinct sensibility (watchful, precise, attuned to color and pattern). However, she encounters little real resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle; she mostly receives and accepts revelations. Her donor heart and “iridescent caution” are conceptually rich but not exploited for internal conflict. The final choice to become guardian of these stories feels fitting but largely unpressured and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s motivation (relieving the labyrinth’s quantified sorrow and learning what trees witness) is clear and consistent, and his choices—using the sextant, unspooling the grid—arise logically from that. However, he experiences little genuine internal conflict; he’s almost entirely competent, patient, and serene. Emotional embodiment is present (“pulse that matched the rhythm of his own sorrow”) but not very contradictory or pressured. The final easing of his grief feels earned but low-cost, more gentle drift than hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s goal (rekindling the realm) is clear, but she reads more as a symbolic caretaker than as a fully individuated person. Her “scattered memory keeper” trait is evocative yet underused in scene—her memories don’t complicate or sharpen choices. Emotional beats are mostly declared in elevated language rather than embodied in concrete, idiosyncratic responses. The final realization about “true alchemy” lands, but with little on-page struggle or contradictory impulse leading into it.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The recluse’s motives (guilt over abandoning a friend, hunger for knowledge, desire to help unseen souls) are clear and consistent, and his hesitation vs. curiosity is well dramatized in “a delicate dance of staying while leaving.” Interiority is particular, not generic, and the final realization about carrying grief into the world feels earned by prior beats. The major weakness is that the abandoned friend remains an abstract backstory figure, so the emotional cost never fully sharpens on the page. The concluding insight is a bit neat, verging on tidy rather than genuinely knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to find the sacred in the ordinary—is clear and consistently expressed through his choices (tending the guerrilla garden, reverently handling the loaf, sharing it). Interiority is present but often rendered in conceptual language rather than sharply embodied contradiction, so his emotional texture feels a bit floaty. There is only a soft progression from noticing to quiet resolve, with little sense of genuine internal conflict or cost. The piece reads as a delicately sketched sensibility rather than a fully pressured character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chief’s quiet, obsessive professionalism and private motivation (“a personal pilgrimage toward the forgotten syllables of her own childhood”) are clear and consistent, and her actions track cleanly with those traits. However, internal conflict is muted: she feels pressure but rarely exhibits contradictory impulses or genuine struggle on the page. Her endurance and the final vow read as evolution of stance, but at a relatively low emotional temperature. The lack of another on-page character removes relationship-based crucible pressure that might have sharpened her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila’s motives (protect the truce, stop the theft, live up to her father’s legacy) are clear and her actions track them cleanly, but internal contradiction is only lightly sketched (duty vs. history) rather than dramatized under pressure. Her competence sometimes flattens potential struggle—she foils the scout with little real doubt or moral friction. Embodied emotion is present in sensory grounding (smells, the watch fob’s warmth) but often ceded to abstract formulations like “motivation was to capture the sound of trust breaking.” The final endurance—keeping the truce through the night and walking into uncertain tomorrow—reads as earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arin’s motivation is clear and particular—an empirical skeptic drawn to a quasi-mystical phenomenon—and his awe growing out of doubt is nicely tracked. However, his internal conflict remains relatively soft: he shifts from skepticism to kinship without a moment where competing impulses genuinely bite. Emotional response is mostly embedded in observation rather than embodied tension or risk. The closing realization that he, too, is a “quiet storm” works but lands more as lyric reframe than costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s motivation (to unlock her own blocked creativity via the cave and lock) is clear and consistent, and her actions track logically from that drive. However, interior conflict is relatively thin: she feels “inescapable calling” and “fractured inspiration,” but we don’t see competing impulses or genuine risk in choosing to engage the lock. Emotions tend to be labeled through atmosphere rather than embodied contradiction in her body and thoughts. The final untangling of her heart is thematically apt but lands as a modest, not hard-won, shift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The calligrapher’s motivation (belief in candor, refusal to sign the proclamation, desire to find where lost conversations go) is clear and drives her choices. However, she experiences little real internal conflict or degradation under pressure; she moves from conviction to fulfillment with minimal ambivalence or fear. Emotional states are implied more than embodied, which slightly flattens key beats. Her final stance feels earned but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The tuner has a clear, specific motivation and a consistent routine, but we rarely feel him under genuine pressure that would expose contradiction or deeper texture. His interiority is mostly implied through external description; we don’t get concrete, embodied emotion or a moment where his resolve wavers. Micro-choices (tightening joints, stepping back, whispering a promise) reinforce a single, unwavering trait set. The result is a coherent but somewhat static character rather than a fully dramatized psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vira’s motivation—to resolve her “inner static” while protecting the farm—is clear and carries through her decisions, especially in choosing to use the box to contain chaos. The android/human nostalgia contradiction is intriguing but mostly stated rather than deeply dramatized under pressure. Her emotional shift at the end feels earned but slightly tidy, with little resistance or self-sabotage on the way. The lack of another on-page character limits relational pressure that could have sharpened her inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s core motive—proving that listening heals—is clear and consistent, and small choices (cataloguing the letters, making an exhibit, guiding the child) align with it. However, she faces almost no real resistance or internal contradiction; she’s more emblematic than psychologically complex. Embodied emotion is light, with the prose leaning on abstractions like “sandstorm calm” rather than specific, felt conflict. The final beat with the child is touching but not earned as a costly change for her.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene is vivid and particular—her copper-thread braid, algae ink, and dance-coding stand out—but her inner life is largely implied rather than dramatized. Motivation (encrypting vulnerability into strength) is consistent yet rarely faces resistance or contradiction on the page. There’s little sense of internal conflict or costly trade-offs, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at an elite level. The closing beats read as a steady fulfillment of a stance she already holds rather than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation (to locate “deleted memories”) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her rituals with coffee grounds and flowers give her a specific inner life. However, there’s little real contradiction or struggle—everything unfolds with near-ritual ease—so we don’t see her under genuine pressure. The emotional cost of carrying or reclaiming these memories remains abstract rather than embodied. The final understanding feels earned but relatively low-stakes for her as a person.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The summoner’s goal and competence are clear, and her actions track cleanly with the stated mission to hush the prophecy. However, she lacks contradictory impulses or visible internal cost; she moves from intention to success with almost no friction. Emotional texture is mostly projected onto the environment rather than embodied in her body or decisions. The final “tranquil blaze of purpose” reads as granted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characterization is textured and specific—Liora feels distinct, and the narrator’s curiosity and reverence for stone language are clear—but internal conflict is soft and largely untested. The “agreed upon lies” premise hints at moral/psychological tension without truly forcing contradictory impulses into collision. The emotional change (from desperate seeker to participant in a shared ritual) is credible but comes easily, with little visible cost. More pressure on the lie/truth axis or on what the narrator risks in seeking this knowledge would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clearly articulated (“translate isolation into independence”), but it’s mostly told rather than dramatized through specific, pressured choices. Her inner life leans abstract—“archive of her own quarantined memory,” “resonance structures”—with little embodied or contradictory emotion. The transition from doubt to “ghostly resolve” feels more declared than earned by on-page struggle, muting the cost of her change. As a result, she reads more as a thematic vessel than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s goal (“to forgive the unfinished”) and her vocation as a forger are clear and consistent, and her choice to use forgery as balm rather than weapon gives her a defined moral stance. However, interiority stays fairly declarative; we’re told her trait “true art must endure wisely” more than we see it tested under real pressure. There’s little genuine contradiction or struggle on the page—her resolve seems stable from start to finish, with limited sense of tempted betrayal or doubt. The closing shift feels like a deepening of an already-held belief rather than a hard-won, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to understand why some people echo—and her perception and role as a singer are well integrated with that drive. However, internal conflict is minimal; she rarely hesitates or feels genuinely torn, so the arc leans toward steady revelation rather than pressured choice. The emotional progression (from curiosity to quiet ache to peace) is credible but smooth, with little sense of risk or self-implication. Her final promise feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The whisperer’s motivation (“to expose the hidden purity buried beneath the wreckage”) is clear and consistent, and her methodical choices (mapping dreams, whispering to the globe, embedding cameos) track with that aim. However, she reads more as an archetypal function than a fully individuated person; we learn almost nothing about her personal contradictions, fears, or blind spots. Emotional reactions are mostly implied through atmosphere rather than embodied in her body or thought. The final decision to leave the shrine feels right but carries little visible personal cost beyond a generalized sense of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The philosopher is more an emblematic figure than a fully individuated character; his motivation—appreciating hidden effort—is clear but never tested against a competing desire or credible resistance. Interiority remains abstract and lyric rather than character-particular, so we learn little that distinguishes him from any contemplative archetype. The “decision” to mend his own memory with the whisk is thematically apt but carries no visible cost or contradiction. As a result, the closing resolve to “continue mending the invisible nets of life” feels gently earned but not dramatically deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to puncture corporate myths and find the truth— and her competence feels earned through methodical actions like sorting paper by ink hue and scent. However, her interiority remains relatively tidy and unconflicted; she rarely hesitates, doubts, or shows contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional states are often summarized rather than embodied, especially around the “curse” and the moment she activates the stillpoint. The final responsibility she takes on reads as meaningful but low-cost on the page, limiting the depth of perceived change.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.0)
    The visionary’s core motive is clear and consistent—“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—and his actions (mirrors, coils, drones, rallying clans) align with it. However, his inner life remains mostly emblematic rather than individuated, with little embodied emotion or contradiction under pressure. The piece summarizes his success more than it dramatizes hard choices, so change carries minimal felt cost. As a character he reads as a symbolic function more than a fully inhabited person.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s longing to preserve ancestral music is clear and consistent, and his actions—collecting sounds, arranging jars, teaching the child—align with that drive. However, he is almost entirely without flaw or contradiction, so his emotional journey feels more like a confirmation of goodness than a pressured transformation. Internal conflict (doubt, weariness, resentment) is largely absent, which softens the sense of cost in his “redemption.” The child appears too late and too simply to deepen characterization beyond a symbolic link.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motives (protecting the Heart, balancing logic and feeling) are clear and consistently drive her actions, and her profession grounds her competence. The “logically emotional” tension appears on the page—she calculates frequencies while responding viscerally to sound—but her internal conflict is more gestured at than fully dramatized under pressure. The external threat of “storm-born seekers” remains abstract, so her choices are never tested against another will in scene. The closing tear and sense of earned duty give her a modest but credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to “sculpt patience from impatience”—is clear and consistently expressed, and her actions (tracking moon paths, aligning the compass, forging a mantra) align with it. Interiority is present but leans abstract; we’re told more about her “restrained wildness” than we see it conflicted on the page. The shift from restless yearning to steady ember is legible and earned by the ritual, but the internal struggle feels gently sketched rather than sharply dramatized. There’s little sense of genuine mistake or moral risk, which keeps the arc emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s professional role and values (preventable deaths, resistance to bureaucratic neglect) are clear and consistent, and her decision to trace and turn the valve is suitably motivated. However, her emotions skew abstract (“fortified vulnerability,” “watchfully calm”) with little concrete embodiment or contradiction under pressure. We rarely see genuine internal conflict or a live temptation to look away or minimize risk. The closing acceptance of her own forged demeanor lands more as declared insight than as the culmination of dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chaplain’s motivation (testing and possibly redeeming the inmate’s work) is clear and consistent, and his gentleness comes through in how he handles the heart and the apology. However, his internal conflict is mild—he briefly weighs the “moral weight” of tampering, then proceeds with little real struggle or contradictory impulse. The shopkeeper is more a thematic functionary than a pressured character, offering guidance but facing no stakes herself. The final shift toward “a new ministry” feels plausible but not deeply earned by visible cost or internal upheaval.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s curiosity and mischief are vivid and consistent, and the “yearning algorithm” provides a quasi-character counterpart, but there is almost no internal conflict or visible cost to her choices. Her motivation to ring the bell and then chase the next mystery is clear yet frictionless. The result is a textured persona without a real arc or tested values.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lia’s motivation—professional curiosity that becomes a moral commitment to the lost crew—is clear and consistent, and her actions follow logically from it. However, her interiority remains relatively thin and idealized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. Her emotional responses are more implied by atmosphere than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The closing vow to guard the archive feels earned but not deeply conflicted, which keeps the arc solid but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The peacekeeper’s motivation—to answer the shard’s call and “map empathy onto action”—is consistent but remains largely abstract, with little concrete personal stake or cost. Her interiority is thinly differentiated; she feels more like an archetype than an individuated person with contradictory impulses. The key choice (to use the mirrors and reconstitute the sphere) is smooth and unquestioned, so we miss struggle, doubt, or blind spots that would texture her. The closing understanding about listening and compassion reads more as thesis than as a hard-won, character-particular realization.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s motive (euthanasia tourism transmuted into seeking the “sound of endings”) is clear and consistent, and the interiority feels particular rather than generic. However, almost all conflict is articulated in reflection rather than forced into concrete, pressured choices, so we see few moments where contradictory impulses truly collide on the page. The volunteers remain a faceless collective, offering atmosphere but no relational crucible to test her stance. The final reorientation toward life is emotionally plausible but comes cheaply, without a visibly difficult decision in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    The sentinel’s motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to translate a failed romance into nourishment for the vineyard—but his inner life stays mostly in the register of stated motive and metaphor. We rarely see contradictory impulses or concrete, embodied emotion beyond “lonely watch” and a generic sense of misfit. His final sense of wholeness is legible but feels declared more than earned through on-page struggle. The lack of specific past details or relational frictions keeps him from being fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    The Keeper has clear motivation and a faint interior shift (from role-performer to someone who fully “understood his purpose”), but his psychology remains archetypal rather than individuated. Emotions are mostly implied via atmosphere, with little embodied contradiction or on-page struggle. The prophet and villagers function as flat foils rather than pressure sources. The final stance feels earned enough for this length, but the cost of his devotion is barely hinted at.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motive—using archives to heal collective pain—is clear and consistent, and her occupational lens (“subtle puzzle archivist”) gives her a distinct way of interacting with the world. However, she rarely experiences real internal contradiction or doubt; her calm competence goes largely untested. The lack of a visible cost or difficult trade-off at the end keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motive—to decode language’s growth—is clear and consistent, and her shift from “weathered innocence” to quiet resolve is legible. However, she rarely experiences real friction or contradiction; her “reticence” doesn’t cost her anything on the page. Emotional texture is gentle and fairly one-note, with limited embodied stress or ambivalence. The final offering is moving but feels more like a continuation than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prophet’s longing and motive (to capture the sound of aging) are clear and consistent, and his actions (seeking chalk, arranging driftwood, recording, inscribing) align with that drive. However, his interiority remains relatively one-note—pervasive yearning without much contradictory impulse or sharply dramatized internal conflict. The “precognitively forgetful” trait is intriguing but underused in shaping his actual choices. The final understanding feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sage is vivid as an archetype—patient, ritualized, professionally competent—but remains emotionally distant and largely unconflicted. His motivation (to repair and to “harness the ephemeral”) is clear and consistent, yet we rarely feel any risk that he might fail or falter. The line “He felt the weight of centuries lift, his purpose clarified” gestures toward internal change but leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction or cost. This keeps the character from reaching truly memorable complexity despite a strong, coherent presence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s role and core motivation are clear and consistent, but she reads more as an archetypal “serene guide” than a psychologically particular individual. We get almost no contradictory impulses or real internal friction around death, ritual, or her work; she moves through the scene with unerring calm. Mr. Harlan is present largely as a receptive surface rather than an active counterpart. The final stance feels emotionally appropriate but not deeply earned through complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her quiet, methodical temperament fits the work she undertakes. However, she faces little real resistance, and we see almost no contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle—she moves from intention to success without meaningful inner friction. The realization about shadows feels conceptually apt but emotionally underdeveloped, with minimal sense of cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara has a clear, particularized worldview (forgiving skeptic, bone-setter who maps mistakes into constellations), and her actions align with that motivation. However, her internal conflict is muted: doubt is gestured at (“cleft in certainty”) but never forces a difficult trade-off or visibly degrades her thinking under pressure. The emotional progression is mostly smooth acceptance rather than genuinely contradictory impulses playing out in scene. The final shift toward hope feels consistent but low-cost, more affirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.0)
    The star watcher’s core motivation—“to share light without using fire”—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. However, she reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully individuated person, with little contradiction or pressure testing her resolve. Interiority is mostly lyrical abstraction rather than specific, embodied feeling. The closing realization about becoming “the gentle weight that steadied wandering hearts” lands, but at low emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is clear and consistent—her grief, protective tenderness, and urge to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” motivate each action, especially offering the pendant to the interface. The piece is more about endurance and quiet transformation than sharp contradiction, so we don’t see much live internal conflict or irrationality under pressure. Her relationship with her sister is powerful but summarized rather than dramatized, which softens the emotional bite. The final sense of healing feels earned but a touch tidy, with limited visible cost beyond implied vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The novelist’s core drive (to collect “shapes of different hopes”) and her doubt about whether they’re “hers to bind” give her a credible internal contradiction, but it remains abstract and under-pressured. Her micro-choices (moving against the current, placing the fragment on the page, deciding to return) align with the stated motive yet never require a clearly felt sacrifice. Emotion stays largely in the realm of conceptual reverence rather than embodied tension. The final stance—conflicted yet resolute—feels coherent but not deeply earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation (restore sacred practices) is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her choices and attention. Interiority is gently present (“Mara’s heart beat with purpose”), but she experiences little real internal contradiction or doubt, which keeps her arc from feeling fully pressured. Her realization that the “remedy was not a potion but a reenactment of memory” is earned but emotionally low-temperature. The final vow to teach others has cost in implication (lifelong duty) but is not sharply dramatized as a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist’s vocation and temperament are clear—care, patience, reverence—and her actions consistently express those traits. Her motivation (to translate heartbeats into maps of feeling) is coherent and present throughout. What’s thinner is genuine internal contradiction or visible cost; she never wavers, doubts, or sacrifices anything concrete on the page. The closing “covenant” reads as an extension of what she already is, not a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    Corin’s motivation—to restore the timer and “store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is clear and consistent, and his reflective temperament fits the task he undertakes. However, his interiority stays fairly one-note: contemplative, patient, quietly pleased, with little in the way of contradictory impulses or real emotional risk. The realization that the cellar is “not a prison but a library” lands as an intellectual adjustment more than a fraught inner turn. There is endurance and dedication, but almost no dramatized cost or genuine struggle that would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.0)
    The fractal weaver’s purpose and role are clear, but she functions more as an archetypal ritual figure than a psychologically specific person. Her emotions are mostly inferred from atmosphere rather than embodied in distinct, contradictory impulses. There’s little sense of internal conflict or cost to her, so the final “smile” feels serene rather than hard-won. This limits how deeply a reader can invest in her beyond admiring the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s grief and motivation are clear, specific, and grounded in tangible actions (carving, sealing sap), and the circus widow angle gives her an individual texture. However, her internal journey is relatively smooth and un-resisted; contradictory impulses (“tool vs. trap,” holding on vs. letting go) are more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The shift from sorrow to acceptance feels earned but low-friction, with little sense of genuine risk that she might fail or choose differently. This keeps the arc emotionally convincing but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to trade regret and gathered stories for a glimpse of the path she abandoned—is clear and consistently expressed, and the emotional climax (accepting the memory and choosing to “carry these stories forward”) feels earned. Her interiority is vivid and character-specific, though often voiced in abstract, poetic terms rather than sharply embodied contradictions. The relationship with the ghost-as-younger-self is conceptually strong but somewhat under-pressured; their dynamic could bear more friction or resistance. The final shift from being haunted to having a companionate ghost reads as a real, if gently handled, change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The intern’s motivation and professional mindset are clear and consistent, and her engineering choices plausibly drive the action. However, her interior life stays largely in one register of “stoic wonder” without much contradiction or messiness. There’s little visible cost or genuine struggle as she succeeds, so her final sense of fulfillment feels somewhat untested. The “engineered heart” line gestures at depth but isn’t earned through earlier, more specific emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scribe’s motive—reconciling with an abandoned, “too sentimental” dream—is clear and consistent, and his introversion is well-embodied through his attention to gears and quiet. However, internal conflict is soft: his fear of the guild and his longing for the memory-clock never really clash on the page, so his shift feels gentle rather than hard-won. The key reframing of the dream “not as a task but as a quiet friend” is effective but arrives without much resistance. Overall, he reads specific and credible, but the arc avoids sharper contradictions or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    The seeker’s motivation—to understand and dismantle the “architecture of lies”—is clear and consistent, and his small physical choice at the lock reflects that drive. However, he remains more archetype than person: we get very little concrete, individualizing detail or embodied emotion. Internal conflict is almost absent; he glides from uncertainty to serene resolve without friction or contradiction. The closing resolve is plausible but not deeply earned because no real cost or competing impulse is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    The seed collector’s motives (preserving ancient methods, infinite patience, reverence for the weavers) are clear and consistent, and his choices—decoding, performing the fulgurite ritual, committing to a vigil—align with them. However, his interiority remains largely one-note in its serenity; we rarely see contradictory impulses or stress-testing of his values. The line “He understood that preserving the ancient methods required not only memory but the willingness to listen eternally” gestures toward change, but the change is more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The traveler has a clear vocation and motive—mapping a “geography of healing” through living obituaries—and his stance shifts from solitary burden to quiet hope by the end. However, his interiority remains relatively abstract and emblematic, with little concrete contradiction or sharply dramatized internal conflict. The emotional cost of his work is more told than shown, which blunts the impact of the final softening.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prince’s core motive (reawaken beauty) and flaw (raised on conquest and machinery) are clear and consistent, and his actions align with them. However, his interiority remains largely summarized rather than dramatized in moments of pressure, and we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses on the page. His transformation from bedraggled to radiant feels thematically apt but emotionally under-earned, as it occurs almost immediately after the phoenix’s emergence with little struggle. The lack of visible cost or resistance at the peak choice keeps the arc from feeling truly lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s core paradox—firefighter daughter of an arsonist—gives her strong, specific motivation, and her actions (the graft ritual) align cleanly with that drive. Emotional experience is largely embodied through setting (“black sand… held a memory of fire that resonated with her own tangled lineage”) rather than nuanced, conflicting impulses. She feels grief and resolve, but there’s little on-page struggle or misstep under pressure, so the change at the end reads more like confirmation than a hard-won shift. The villagers’ relationship to her is sketched rather than dramatized, softening relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s goal and core traits (skepticism, patience, curiosity) are clear and consistent, and her actions align with them. However, her interiority remains mostly implied through description rather than dramatized internal conflict; the skeptic-to-believer shift feels conceptually clean but emotionally under-contested. The luminous skepticism seldom produces on-page mistakes or hesitation that complicate her choices. The final acceptance of being a “keeper of light” lands, but with limited visible cost or contradiction resolved in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    Her core motivation—to share light without fire, in fidelity to generational vows—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the creation of the sonar choir and burial of the gear. However, her interiority remains archetypal rather than individuated; we don’t see sharp contradictory impulses under pressure so much as a steady, serene purpose. Emotional states are mostly implied by atmosphere rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final realization about the gear as a bridge feels earned but is more conceptual than psychologically textured.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    Eliam’s vocation, temperament, and desire to map grief are clear and consistently dramatized through his rituals and receptivity to Mara. However, he encounters little resistance or internal contradiction; he moves from observer to enlightened craftsman without a real struggle that tests or complicates his values. Mara is more a benevolent exposition device than a pressuring presence. The final understanding feels earned texturally but not hard-won in terms of character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s vocation, ethical diligence, and belief in “incremental absolution” give her a clear, particular motivation, and her actions consistently align with that drive. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or real temptation; she is largely a pure vessel for the theme. Emotional embodiment is mostly externalized through environment (“ridge seemed to exhale”) rather than grounded in her body. The closing commitment to keep working lands more as reaffirmation than as a difficult, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The gardener’s core motivation and temperament are clear, and his gentle ritualistic behavior feels consistent with his role. However, his emotional life is thin: there’s little contradiction, fear, or doubt as he handles the dead’s secrets, which keeps the arc from feeling deeply earned. His “epiphany” about intention’s shape arrives smoothly rather than under visible internal pressure. The result is a credible but somewhat abstract, low-friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cartographer’s motive and philosophy are clear, but his interior life is mostly told in abstractions (“humbled by his own ignorance”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. He encounters little visible resistance or doubt on the page; choices (accepting the commission, building the model) come too smoothly. The late realization about “true mastery” feels thematically apt but somewhat unearned because we never see him truly risk failure or cling to a mistaken belief. As a result, he reads more as an idea-bearing figure than a fully realized person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s core motive (“to teach dust to tell stories”) is clear and nicely particular, and her choice to become the conduit for the pirate broadcast tracks with that. However, she faces almost no resistance and exhibits little internal contradiction, so we learn who she is but not what she’ll do under genuine pressure. Emotional states are mostly implied by atmosphere rather than embodied, leaving her somewhat abstract. The ending’s “quiet pride” works but isn’t deeply earned by visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s role and purpose are clear, but she reads more as an archetypal function (“charcoal portrait ash scatterer”) than a fleshed-out individual with contradictions. Her motivations are mostly stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices, so the internal cost of her work remains abstract. The strongest moment is the faint smile after the “mirage of safety shattered,” which hints at resilience and ambivalence but comes very late. Earlier beats could better show competing impulses (dread vs duty, yearning vs numbness) in action.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motive—to decide how to frame the city’s past while preserving its water methods—is clear and consistent, and the internal contradiction (“rationally rebellious,” agonizing over a single truth but ending in pluralism) is thematically apt. Interiority is specific and textured, with the sewer, rats, mudskipper, and cog all filtered through his philosophical lens. However, the emotional life stays mostly cerebral; we get very little embodied stress or genuinely messy conflict, so the final acceptance costs him little on the page. The arc feels more like a smooth, well-argued shift than a pressured, contradictory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The choir teacher’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her small choices (to play, to invite specific townspeople to join) fit her role and aim. However, her interiority stays archetypal—“mission,” “resolve,” “quiet crusade”—rather than exposing messy or contradictory impulses under pressure. The townspeople remain a generalized mass with almost no individuating detail beyond “a child with a broken voice” and “a veteran with a hoarse laugh.” The final sense of change for her is gentle and plausible but emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive and method are vivid and specific—“tasting memories” as craft is excellent—but she encounters almost no resistance, so we see little contradiction or strain under pressure. Her quiet defiance and tenderness toward the vines sketch a distinctive person without lapsing into stereotype. However, the lack of on-page internal conflict or risk (she never seems in danger of failing or doubting) keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level. The final promise to the seedlings thus reads more as a natural continuation than a costly, character-altering choice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation (to preserve wonder) is clear and consistent, and her actions—opening the box, using the key, adopting a new ritual—align with it. However, her involuntary truthfulness never meaningfully constrains or complicates her choices; it feels like color rather than crucible. Internal conflict is minimal: she “hopes” and then gets what she hoped for with little friction. The final stance feels more like affirmation than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—sanctifying a “restless mind” and understanding why houses feel alive—is clear and consistently pursued, and the choice to buy and test the shard follows credibly. Interiority is particular (e.g., “creeping normality noticer”) and embodied through sensory attention more than abstract labels. However, internal conflict is minimal: there’s little sense of competing impulses or real risk in using the shard, so the arc feels like a smooth affirmation rather than a pressured change. The elderly woman functions more as a chorus than a source of pressure, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    The statue has a clear, stated motive (“to welcome nuance into a certainty”), but there’s almost no friction, contradiction, or cost attached to that desire. Interiority remains abstract and mission-focused rather than character-particular; we never see fear, doubt, or competing impulses. “Incisively kind” functions more as label than dramatized temperament. The ending’s sense of fulfillment is therefore conceptually earned but not emotionally earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aric’s core motivation (prove perpetual motion / capture missed opportunity) is clear and consistently pursued, and his shift from trying to “capture” a missed chance to honoring its persistence reads as an earned internal adjustment. However, his interiority remains largely abstract and expository—there’s little embodied emotion or contradictory impulse on the page (e.g., we’re told he’s a “grim optimist” but don’t feel that tension in concrete reactions). His main flaw/obsession (the chipped side refusing to land) does shape his work and final stance, but the emotional cost of that obsession is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. For elite publication, we’d need at least one pressured micro-choice where his desire and doubt collide in scene, not just in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s interiority is coherent and specific—insomnia, “methodically hopeful” work, and her ritual of notes all align into a clear psyche—but her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized. The toll of her insomnia and loneliness is touched rather than really pressed, so we don’t see contradictory impulses tested in-scene. Jiro’s brief appearance is effective as a reactive lens to her actions but remains schematic as a person. The final endurance—continuing to paint and leave notes—feels earned but carries only a softly sketched cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivation—to rescue the city’s dying arts—is clear, consistent, and refracted nicely through choices like reviving the bread custom and using the lens as a tool of cultural revival. However, we rarely feel her under genuine pressure; she encounters no serious resistance, and internal contradiction (“sweet and dangerous” drive) is stated more than dramatized. Emotional experience is often summarized at the civic level (“the city fell into a quiet”) rather than embodied as her specific struggle. The final “legend” framing hints at cost, but that cost is conceptual rather than personally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The clock maker’s goal and professional competence are clear, but his interior life is thin beyond a generalized “bleak exhilaration.” He encounters little resistance, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or real stress behavior. The shift from “weight of destiny” to feeling it “lift” is conceptually strong but emotionally under-earned. This reads as a capable premise character rather than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation (freeing herself/others from fear and dealing with the aftermath of her brother’s resuscitation) is sketched but not deeply embodied; we rarely feel specific, character-particular turmoil beneath the surreal actions. Her swallowing the clasp and moving through the ritual read as genre-appropriate but emotionally under-interrogated choices. The advisor is an effective archetype but more function than person. The final bargain hints at a meaningful internal cost but lands more as concept than grounded emotional renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prophet’s motivation is explicit and consistent (“to turn obstacles into instruments”), and his actions align with that aim throughout. However, interiority is almost entirely thematic rather than psychological; he remains a symbolic figure more than a person with contradictory impulses. There’s no felt internal conflict or visible cost at the end—only serene fulfillment—so his arc lands as static devotion rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her drive to decipher the turtles and reach the silent watchers underpins every action. Her profession and habits (spiral maps, nightly whistle, solitary decoding) particularize her nicely. Internal contradiction is relatively soft—her shift from dread to resolve is earned but not heavily contested on the page. Emotional states are more implied through setting and action than embodied in a deeply idiosyncratic interior voice, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal conflict over noble lies versus truth is asserted rather than really tested in scene. He never faces a hard choice with visible cost; everything unfolds smoothly once he finds the letter. Interiority is competent but leans on conceptual summaries (“emotionally rational”) more than embodied contradiction. The final “smile” and tidy reconciliation of compassion and fact feel somewhat unearned because he hasn’t sacrificed anything.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to witness and preserve “abandoned dreams”—is clear and coherently expressed through her methods with the notes and inkwell. The internal contradiction of being “stoically sensitive” is dramatized in lines like “her heart hammered like a drum, yet her face remained a mask of calm calculation.” However, her conflict is mostly atmospheric rather than pressured; she’s never forced into a hard trade-off on the page. The final vow to return is credible but carries only a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation (tracing honest origins, preserving knowledge) is clear and consistent, and her occupational mindset is well-rendered. However, she faces almost no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she moves from task to task with serene competence. The “tranquilly perceptive” stance never strains or cracks under pressure, so we don’t see much moral or emotional cost. This keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a level required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lantern maker’s motivation—transmuting grief into origami cranes—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his actions. Interiority is present but often summarized in abstract terms (“luminous torment”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment. We don’t see him genuinely torn or tempted to refuse the ritual; his emotional path feels steady rather than pressured into a difficult choice. Still, the final easing of grief reads as an earned endurance/partial shift grounded in the preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The survivor’s grief, scientific rigor, and refusal of revenge build a clear, specific interiority, and his micro-choices (tuning the visor, stepping toward/into the seam) track cleanly from that motivation. The dread/exhilaration pairing gives him some contradiction but his psychology stays relatively straightforward, with little real resistance once the pool calls. His final conceptual shift—unused potential as a state of being—feels earned but emotionally undercomplicated. For elite publication, we’d want at least one sharper, messier conflict between his loss and his leap.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira has a clear role and goal, and her mix of technical competence and quiet awe comes through, but she never faces a real dilemma or visible cost that would deepen her as a character. Her “perpetually surprised” trait is told rather than dramatized, and internal conflict is largely absent. The pilgrim functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a pressure source. The closing vow to guard the chip feels pleasant but low-stakes and not strongly earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is specific and textured—a “guilt-ridden black market genealogist” whose profession and conscience are well integrated—but his inner conflict is comparatively one-note. He wants absolution and takes the path offered with little resistance or contradiction on the page. The decision to accept the stranger’s job and the later “redemption” feel emotionally plausible but not deeply contested. The arc reads more as confirmation of an existing guilt than as a hard-won change under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The negotiator’s guilt and desire to atone are clear and consistent, and small choices (bringing the parchment, whispering apology) arise from that history. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: we’re told of past failure, but he rarely seems genuinely torn in the present scene. The opposing negotiator remains largely a type (“scarred veteran”) without individuating detail beyond resolve. The final shift toward peace feels earned enough, but at relatively low psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The navigator’s motives (haunted by betrayal yet compelled toward new horizons) are clear and consistent, and his eventual acceptance of regret is credibly foreshadowed by early images of “flickering faith.” However, his interiority leans on generalized metaphors (“tidal wave of what-ifs”) rather than more idiosyncratic, scene-specific thoughts, which keeps him from feeling fully singular. Internal conflict is present—hope vs. sorrow—but is mostly stated rather than dramatized through hard micro-choices under pressure. The final stance shift (regrets as tide to ride) is earned but rendered in somewhat abstract, tidy language.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s motivation (redemption via empathy) is clear and sustained, and the final reframing of the “clean slate” feels earned. Interiority is reasonably specific—e.g., the comfort of the humming baseball, the shock of seeing a more empathetic self in the mirror. However, inner conflict is described more than dramatized; contradictory impulses under pressure are muted, with few moments where a real choice feels agonized. The emotional shift at the end lands, but at a slightly summarized, reflective distance rather than through a sharply pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s desire to reforge her bond with Arion is clear and consistent, and her role as beast whisperer gives her a distinctive frame. However, her “reluctant” dread of metamorphosis is mostly asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted impulses in the moment. The acceptance of bark-skin reads emotionally smooth, with little felt struggle or sacrifice on the page. The relationship dynamic with Arion is touching but sketched more in cosmic language than in specific, individuating memories or frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.6)
    The cartomancer’s core motive (answering the elders’ call, seeking where lost time accumulates, soothing the twins) is clear and her actions align with it, but her psychology remains more archetypal than individuated. The paradox of “mourning a future not yet lived” is intriguing yet under-dramatized; we’re told she’s “willingly perplexed,” but we rarely feel that confusion cost her anything in scene. Interiority leans toward poetic generality rather than character-specific contradiction or blind spots. Her final release of grief is conceptually sound but feels relatively unstruggled-for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Nara’s pacifist motivation and method (“no force, only compassion, would pry open the gate”) are clear and consistent, and her joy/lightness link gives a concrete behavioral quirk. However, she reads more as an archetypal vessel for theme than a fully individuated person with contradictions, and we see little real struggle or doubt in her interiority. The cost of leaving the ship and bearing grief is gestured at but not deeply felt on the page. Character change is present but relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s core motivation (exhausted philanthropist seeking to understand “the texture of transformation”) is clear and consistent, and her choice to free the fireflies aligns with that drive. However, her interiority is largely thematic and declarative rather than conflicted; we don’t see genuinely competing impulses or a felt cost to her decisions. The fisherman functions more as a receptive witness than a pressure source, so relational dynamics remain thin. The closing shift in her stance toward her charitable work feels earned but a bit too easy, with little on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s core drive—to catalyze a silent revolution using the cradle—is clear and consistently expressed, and his “calmly inventive” nature is nicely dramatized in the sundial and mirror work. However, he encounters essentially no resistance, so we never see him under real pressure or in moral conflict, and there’s little sense of contradictory impulses. Emotional embodiment is minimal; he feels more like an elegant functionary of the premise than a fully inhabited person. The final “slipping back into the shadows” feels earned but low-cost, more competence fantasy than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene’s core motivation (to understand sacred patterns, to turn her curse into a tool) is clear and consistent, and her final reorientation from “prison” to “compass” is earned by prior setup. However, the internal conflict around her precognitive terror is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in concrete, in-the-moment doubts or missteps. Her emotional life leans abstract and cosmic rather than idiosyncratically human, which slightly blunts the cost of her choice. The endurance-style change at the end is credible but could cut deeper if a specific sacrifice or failure were visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s motivation (to ritualize and transmute collective scars) is clear and consistent, but his inner life remains largely conceptual rather than embodied or conflicted. “Furiously tranquil” is evocative, yet we seldom see that contradiction tested in a concrete, pressured choice. He mostly performs a pre-set ritual instead of wrestling with alternatives or visible doubt. The late broadening to “travelers” adopting the ritual further distances us from his specific psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characters are archetypal more than individuated—“dueling philosopher” and “diplomat of ideas” carry conceptual weight but limited interiority or contradiction. The philosopher’s late realization about where questions “go” feels lightly earned rather than built from on-page struggle. Emotional stakes between them are cordial and abstract, so their relationship never quite becomes a crucible. This keeps the ending’s shift more intellectual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira and Rook have clear, appealing cores (vagrant penny poet, patient scholar) and consistent motives around rebuilding and resistance, but we rarely enter their specific, embodied emotional experience. Lira’s monthly molting is conceptually rich yet under-dramatized—no real on-page push-pull or cost emerges from it. Their relationship evolves in summary rather than through pressured choices, so status and conflict between them never truly become a crucible. The final stance—“We have rebuilt a garden in stone”—lands more as declared outcome than paid-for change.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pianist has a clear, consistent motivation (to surprise fate with an encore) and we see concrete choices—climbing, waiting for night, stepping through the reel, playing. However, his inner life remains more archetypal than individuated, with little contradiction or specific personal history. Emotion is carried mostly by externalized images (“steely longing”) rather than embodied, character-particular reactions. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned but not especially costly on a personal level.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (awakening the seed to safeguard the island’s memory) is clear and consistent, and her “empirically whimsical” mindset is convincingly dramatized through how she treats dreams as data. Her luminous doubt versus resolve gives her a credible internal tension, especially around the fear of the monsoon arriving too soon. However, the internal conflict never quite forces a painful trade-off or mistake; she moves from uncertainty to success without a moment where contradictory impulses really clash on the page. The change by the end is more an affirmation of what she already believed than a sharply costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tutor’s motivation is clear and distinctive—atoning for communal sorrow by seeking the “color of unspoken apologies”—and his actions align with it throughout the ritual. However, interior contradiction is minimal; we don’t see him pulled between impulses or paying a visible personal price beyond a gentle melancholy. The emotional life remains largely summarized in the same quiet register rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. His final understanding feels fitting but a bit smooth, with little on-page struggle earning that realization.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.4)
    Lira is defined by labels ("quietly savvy," "portrait thief") rather than dramatized choices or capabilities. She encounters no resistance; the conductor acts as a helper NPC who hands her the keys to every lock without requiring persuasion or struggle. The shift from thief to preserver is a stated realization rather than an earned psychological turn resulting from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.4)
    Mara’s motivation relies heavily on abstract labels ("weighty yet light," "thoughtfully spirited") rather than embodied desire. While she has a stated goal, her internal struggle is resolved through assertion ("abandon the notion") rather than a dramatic choice with a visible cost. The character functions more as a thematic vessel than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is a collection of prompt keywords rather than a realized character; the "stunt double" identity is utilized only for a nonsensical code-breaking mechanic. Emotional progression is asserted through summary ("betrayal of my own mind was more transformative") rather than dramatized in the moment. The transformation from fear to courage is unearned, relying on a magical external agent rather than internal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks genuine agency or internal conflict, functioning as a vessel for the prose rather than a distinct character. The attribute "mildly obsessed" is stated as a label but contradicted by his absolute, high-stakes behavior (making a "covenant with the night"). There is no on-page cost to his actions; he simply performs the required tasks until he dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.7)
    Motivation is externalized into a "curiosity module" rather than embodied, and the emotional arc ("quiet awe") feels asserted rather than earned through specific interiority. The character lacks contradiction, simply executing a sequence of directives without internal friction, doubt, or a difficult choice. The robot functions as a camera for the prompt's requirements rather than a protagonist with a distinct will.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mara serves as a functional archetype rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a distinct voice. Her actions are frictionless execution of a magical process rather than choices made under pressure, resulting in no felt cost or personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, lacking distinct interiority or contradictory impulses. His motivation is stated abstractly ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") rather than felt through struggle, and he faces no meaningful micro-choices that test his "wisely pragmatic" nature. There is no cost to his actions; he acts, and the world simply yields.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.5)
    Lira is a functional cipher defined solely by her role and a theoretical goal, lacking interiority or contradiction. Her "obliging" nature is stated as a label but never tested or leveraged to create friction in her choices. The character experiences no emotional cost or genuine struggle, reacting to the profound concept of time with the same flat competence she applies to the machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mara functions as a passive vessel for the atmosphere rather than an agent with distinct interiority or conflicting needs. Her motivation is stated ("motive that surged within her") rather than dramatized through resistance or cost. She encounters no internal or external obstacles; understanding "blossoms" instantly, making her success feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mirela is a compelling concept ("fault-tolerant oracle"), but her internal struggle remains abstract. The "swallowed lie" is never defined, making her resolution feel like a procedural victory rather than an emotional one. The fever aftermath is told through metaphor rather than dramatized visceral residue.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by inconsistent labels ("religiously skeptical") rather than coherent behavior; despite the label, he immediately employs supernatural methods (psychic radio decoding) without skepticism or internal conflict. Motivation is stated ("to appraise") rather than felt, and his reactions are filtered through abstract metaphors ("felt its pressure settle") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he functions solely as a sensor to advance the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("meticulous," "integrity") rather than dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.2)
    Marlowe functions as a cipher for the prompt’s philosophical assertions rather than a fully realized character; he lacks contradictory impulses or distinct interiority beyond the stated motivation. His "circuitously sincere" nature is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through complex behavior or choice under pressure. There is no felt cost to his actions; he observes, intervenes, and succeeds without personal risk or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mara functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a complex agent; her "insomnia" is stated but does not distort her perception or choices on the page. The prompt phrase "wryly earnest" is applied as a clumsy static label ("moved... wryly earnest") rather than a dramatized trait, and the surrender of her art lacks visceral emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.5)
    Lira acts as a passive vehicle for the setting's magic rather than a protagonist with contradictory impulses or genuine agency. Her defining trait ("didn't see it coming") is a tagline rather than a dramatic engine, and she faces no internal resistance or difficult choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the theme rather than a living character; his actions (collecting, blowing the horn) meet no internal or external resistance. The trait "reactively visionary" is inserted as a diagnostic label ("Because his mind was reactively visionary, he could sense...") rather than demonstrated through costly action. There is no on-page struggle or emotional risk; he succeeds at every step without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by labels ("meticulous," "analytically artistic") rather than choices or behavior. Her motivation is abstract and stated rather than felt, and she lacks any internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Emotional states are delivered via diagnostic telling ("trembling certainty," "awe") rather than embodied experience or reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on contradictory labels ("sympathetic skeptic," "courageously kind") that are stated but not dramatized. Lira offers no resistance to the magical elements despite her alleged skepticism, and her "kindness" is reduced to the ornamental gesture of offering tea to the wind rather than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a stock archetype ("bored immortal") whose internal state is described via abstract labels ("ennui," "emptiness") rather than embodied action. The emotional shift at the end is unearned by struggle, relying on a didactic conversation with a reflection rather than a high-stakes choice. Internal conflict is minimal; curiosity instantly overrides the established boredom without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mara functions as a passive vessel for the magical prop rather than an agent of change; she executes a ritual without facing a difficult choice or internal contradiction.

Motivation is abstract and resolved via assertion ("resolve to turn confusion into exploration") rather than dramatized struggle. Passive reactivity dominates the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a person with grounded agency. Motivation relies on the nebulous desire for "temporary eternity," and the central logic—needing a key found in a randomly discovered cave to open a chest he himself painted and hid—is baffling and unexplained. "Intimate aloofness" appears as a diagnostic label rather than a dramatized trait affecting choice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by adjectives ("disenchanted," "tempered") rather than embodied choice or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira acts as a passive vessel for the ritual rather than a character with conflicting desires; her motivation is declared ("purpose was simple yet fierce") but not tested by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is constructed from prompt labels ("compulsive gambler," "theoretically rebellious") rather than dramatized traits. Her "compulsion" appears only as a useful skill for puzzle-solving rather than a genuine flaw or source of struggle, and her motivation ("to widen perspectives responsibly") reads as an abstract thesis statement rather than a felt human desire.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character interiority is replaced by labeled emotions ("Joyful sorrow filled Arlen’s chest") rather than embodied experience.

She is purely competent and virtuous, devoid of the flaws or limits that drive narrative tension.

    Selene acts as a thematic vessel rather than a person, with abstract motivation ("awaken a deeper sense of wonder") and label-only traits ("innocently cunning" is told, not dramatized through cunning choices).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.1)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly concrete early (“she sought to strip needless drama”), but the decisive shift—her embrace of gradualism—rests more on lyrical declaration than on a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible. The notebook line “The universe preprocesses reality…” is diagnostic self-labeling in the final beat, blunting the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elya’s interiority is vivid—hands “tingling,” heartbeat syncing with glass—but her choices are mostly discovery-driven rather than dilemma-driven; the ledger’s pull is external until the kiln insertion, so the final stance feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrenched. Still, embodied emotion and glass-specific perception keep her from archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s embodied memories of the wreck and her tactile handling of the fork/case give credible interiority; the promise “to rectify the silence” supplies a legible want. Yet the story never forces her to test that motive against a real trade-off—no live option is accepted or refused—so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged. The final smile is earned by imagery, not by a prior micro-choice that costs her anything visible.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marlow’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his boots echoing…like footsteps on a grave”), contradictions act in-scene (stubborn resolve vs crushing pressure), and the final renunciation—floating the last shard where “no mortal could linger”—earns its cost through prior causal micro-choices. One hairline slip: the phrase “carrier of silence” drifts toward diagnostic self-label, nudging deduction. Overall, a textured, flaw-balanced portrait that lands under Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s interiority stays concrete—she listens “beneath the terra-cotta arbor,” rings the bell only after candles are snuffed, and feels responsibility “settle on her shoulders.” These embodied beats anchor her motive to feed mouths without drawing patrols. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the crucible is her own endurance; the choice to keep the bell ringing is earned yet not reversed, so the arc is slight but credible. Hairline slip: “amplified quiet” repeats four times without new contradiction, blunting inner voice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Milo’s spiritual curiosity is shown through concrete micro-choices—aligning the lens, slowing breath, whispering to the veil—so the trait drives action. Yet interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“why the stars sang”) that tells more than embodies, and the final beat is serenity rather than a visible cost. The arc is credible, but the lack of contradiction or forfeiture keeps the change too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lush but abstract; “retrocognitively trapped” is announced, never dramatized in a micro-choice that costs her. The single observable decision—whispering thanks to the garden—feels like gratitude, not a crucible that forecloses a path. No contradictory impulse is played out in scene, so the ending’s “witness” stance reads as serene rather than earned renunciation.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s synesthetic ear and her nightly pilgrimages supply a consistent perceptual signature; the micro-choice to “collect absences” rather than sounds gives her agency under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—she “feels the orchard’s memories settle into her hands,” not abstract grief. No secondary character appears, so status dynamics aren’t tested, and the arc is a quiet Earned Stasis: she accepts the cost of carrying others’ betrayals. The absence of visible flaw or contradiction keeps her above mid-band, though the piece never risks showing her fail or doubt.
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensorial layer (color→sound→void) thickens until the final chord reweights the stake. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—device sings amber/teel, crystallizing the new bridge between broken trust and hope. Cost is legible in the refrain “she understood that to find the sound of trust breaking, she must first hear the silence,” paid nightly as she returns to absorb more absences. Orientation anchors land by line 3; no transitions or shards; one tightening suffices.
    
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-body constrains every move: broken glass limits acoustic samples, kelp tangles slow motion, aurora light dictates when forging can occur. Tool-level detail—coral shard, ashen forge, sleek ear-cup—each alters tactics and recurs charged. Spatial choreography is flawless: forge → roots → glass → aurora → water above, tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s synesthesia: color always arrives first, then translated tone, keeping POV bias strict.
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early and deepens through pattern intensification rather than reversals. Each new absence collected adds weight; sparks falling “like rain” onto kelp mark the visible price, narrowing her emotional bandwidth. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and coherent. The tightening is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; the final chord reconfigures, satisfying the cost test.
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as forge, betrayal as resonance that can be re-tuned into empathy. Subtext lives in gesture—placing the completed device among roots is an act of surrender, not triumph. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of sunrise’s “soft green” heard through water re-prices the concept without statement. Complexity is honored: trust remains breakable even after mending.

    <comment>Lush yet disciplined lyricism—“soot-gray fire feeding on the void between stars”—remains inside Maras plausible lexicon. Sentence rhythm modulates: long hypotactic lines for dive descent, staccato fragments when sparks fall, mirroring sensory overload. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. Patterned elision (color→sound→void) is taught in paragraph 2 and paid off in final chord, earning experimental allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s quietly savvy trait is shown through her deft handling of the rose-lock and moonbeam jar, but interior contradiction is only hinted at rather than dramatized in scene; the final vow feels earned yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied, keeping her just shy of full contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure (pressing the case to the rose, lifting the lid, pouring beams onto the wick) are specific and motive-aligned, giving her agency without overt diagnostic speak. No secondary character exerts reciprocal pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; the conductor is atmospheric more than antagonistic. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait, but the lack of visible flaw-cost in the final beat caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“weighty lightness” governs her gestures—but contradiction stays atmospheric rather than dramatized; no single micro-choice visibly forecloses a path or pays a price. The glass vessels function as proxy action, keeping her passive on the page; the final whisper never risks refusal or loss. Bookmark calendar marking is the only trace of escalating cost, too slight to earn a 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s terror/performative bravido contradiction is dramatized in micro-choices (shell lift, decoding moves, final lever step) and body cues (“heart pounded louder than explosions”). The stunt-cipher mechanic links profession to interior stakes, earning the final amber uptake. Still, the emotional turn is slightly front-loaded; later beats re-declare rather than deepen the flaw/need. Meets base 9+ quick test but not the hairline precision for 7.9+.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle’s obsession with mapping darkness is a vivid, character-specific trait that drives every beat; his micro-choice to “seal the map within his own breath” crystallizes an earned renunciation with bodily cost. Interiority is atmospheric rather than concrete—more mood than muscle or breath—but the contradiction between endless night and the need to chart it is continuously active. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are N/A; the solitary POV is coherent, though emotional embodiment drifts toward abstraction under peak pressure. The final stance—map dissolving into air—reads as credibly endured obsession rather than tidy growth, satisfying the Earned Stasis clause.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Robot’s curiosity module supplies a clean, escalating motive; the “composed” trait holds under literal frost. Interiority stays mechanical-yet-yearning, avoiding stock epiphanies. No contradictory impulses in-scene, only steady climb to data-sublime. Final sweep is a credible renunciation that costs the chance to keep the captured thought.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s interiority is evocative (“folded like origami”), yet her stakes remain abstract; she never makes a visible micro-choice that risks loss. The ledger and lens are handled, but the decision to “illuminate” is reported, not dramatized with cost. The shift from observer to facilitator is announced rather than embodied, so the change feels mild. Still, her quiet registrar persona is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dresser’s motives—prove the garden rewards caretakers—stay consistent, but interiority stays ornamental (“the paradox of blooming withering settle in his bones”) rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse is forced into live choice; he simply keeps polishing. The micro-choice hierarchy is asserted, not shown under threat. Closure earns mild poignancy yet no new self-knowledge is wrested at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s interiority is textured through tactile, mechanically-warmed hands and the quiet obsession with sideways time; the paradoxical pulse of “icy warmth” embodies her. One micro-choice—pulling the glyph-lever—carries the entire causal load and lands with visible cost as the vines shimmer and the birds ascend, earning her quiet smile. No secondary characters apply; her obliging nature is shown via meticulous turbine tending and the whispered promise to the birds at close. The 9+ quick test is met: contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mechanic, linear vs. sideways time) act in scene and the final stance is earned with cost felt in the station’s altered breath.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and body-bound—her “trembling finger,” the bow drawn across swollen wood—yet her contradictory impulse (preserve vs. unlock the ghost’s silence) stays mostly asserted, not dramatized in-scene. The final chord is earned, but the cost is atmospheric rather than personal; we feel the hall exhale more than Mara lose something legible. Still, her perceptual filter is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mirela’s interiority is concrete—fever’s “auroral sorrow,” the swallowed stone—but the oracle’s “fault-tolerant” trait is asserted, not dramatized; no system fault tests her. The moment of smudging the ink is a visible micro-choice, yet her decision to adjust the barometer arrives as declarative summary without contradictory impulse or cost. Relationship/status crucible absent; solo POV. The arc—delirium → calibration → outward resolve—is credible but muted because the swallowed truth’s mass is told, not struggled against in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s “reckless explorer” tag is shown more than told—he alone descends, keeps his senses “half-closed yet razor-sharp,” and the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“the weight…settle into his own ribs”), but the religious skepticism never visibly alters an on-page choice; it is asserted rather than dramatized. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The micro-choice to leave the wheel is credible and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The keeper’s interiority is lyrically rendered—his loose grip on memory is shown through synesthetic silence rather than exposition—but no contradictory impulse ever collides with the mission, so the arc is static observation rather than charged renunciation; the final line records silence rather than paying a new cost. The “witness without judgment” motive remains descriptive wallpaper; it never forces a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora’s interiority is soft-focus (“cautious exuberance” is repeated rather than dramatized) and the only micro-choice—closing the locket—has no visible cost. The curl’s emotional weight is asserted, never tested against a counter-impulse, so the arc is sentimental summary, not pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The odd historian is a vivid archetype—dusty coat, moth-like movement—but his interiority stays generic; “sensitively perceptive” is asserted, never embodied in a contradiction or cost. His probing never risks failure or trades one desire off against another, so agency feels curatorial, not crucible-level. The notebook entries are ritual rather than micro-choices that foreclose options; no moment where gathering stories might cost him silence or exile. Closure is a quiet confirmation, not an earned renunciation, so the character plateaus rather than transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The fortune-cookie writer’s interiority is lyrically sketched—“transpose life into a new key”—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in a single beat; decisions are summarized rather than dramatized. His “surge of purpose” is declared, not embodied in micro-choice, so the foreseen cost feels intellectual, not visceral. The arc lands in stasis rather than change, but the prior causality is too thin to make the renunciation sting.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The priest’s interiority is evocative—his sensed “clock of possession” and the single-color obsession—but we never see a contradictory impulse in scene; he simply proceeds. His final stance (lowering the instrument, bowing to silence) is a peaceful renunciation, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied: no sacrificed relationship, no irreversible wound. At this length the absence of a second on-page character is acceptable, but the lack of micro-choice under duress keeps the arc in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lian’s interior contradiction—yearning to conduct unheard symphonies while fearing the cost of surrendering her past—is embodied in the trembling frost-score she draws. Emotion is shown through tactile micro-choices (aligning shell curve to horizon, releasing glass cookie) rather than labels. The final smile and hovering fingertips crystallize a credible renunciation of homesickness as burden, converting it to compass, with the visual cost of fracturing horizon paid on the page. Still, the causal link between childhood memory-map and the exact moment of symphonic release is more poetic assertion than dramatized sequence, keeping the arc just shy of full inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is poetically dense but abstract; wants and fears never crystallize into concrete micro-choices under pressure. The “labyrinth of self” remains metaphorical—no moment shows him electing one corridor over another with visible stakes. Emotional states are named (“felt the world sigh,” “promise of becoming periodically eternal”) rather than embodied in gesture or risk. Closure relies on dissolution of the tablet, a deus-type beat rather than a choice that costs.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marin’s deafness is shown through haptic attention to vibration rather than label; her decision to flip the shell forward is a visible micro-choice that costs her the safety of silence and thaws her chest. The internal contradiction—music teacher who cannot hear—drives every beat. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets n/a; interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak. Earned stasis: she accepts seasonal return visits, acknowledging numbness may recur—cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is concrete—her fingers on the cool metal “pulse” her own heart. One contradiction is dramatized: the scholar’s mantra of lateral thought versus her solitary need for honesty; the shaft choice makes both collide. Cost is visible: she forfeits the archives’ safety and accepts the quarantine-silence as her new working condition. Voice stays meteorological-poetic without drifting into stock “storm” clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich—scent-maps of grief, lantern-flame synapses—but the “crystal vial” beats feel performed rather than resisted; no micro-choice risks failure. The arc arrives at renunciation (sealing the vial) yet the cost is lyrically declared, not dramatized on the body or purse. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: lantern-trade pragmatism < scent-archive obsession < filial grief. Just shy of 8.8 because the decisive act is off-stage to the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    The poet’s interiority pulses with concrete contradictions: the urge to release the fireflies vs to hoard the lantern, reverence vs playful daring. Embodied emotion shows in “shiver of rope on stone” and frayed fingers tracing murals, not diagnostic labels. Each micro-choice—knotting the rope to the jagged stone—locks to both his quest and the escaped-prisoner ghost inside the fiber, making renunciation legible and costly. Character remains individual, flawed, morally ambiguous; no tidy emotional arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    The violinist’s interiority is lyric but vague—no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page; her single micro-choice (playing to “lift the hush”) is gentle, not costly. No tension between want/fear or flaw/price is staged; she merely observes and responds. The bowl’s hum and villagers’ awe substitute for visible personal stakes or renunciation. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is rich—her “affectionate detachment” is embodied in every gesture, especially the final tuck of the empty vial. The contradiction between caring for emotions yet commodifying them is dramatized, not labeled. No second character on-page, so no status crucible, but her micro-choices (rub, inhale, seal) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only barrier to 9+ is that the renunciation/stance crystallization is subtle rather than wrenching; the cost is felt but not devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mara’s “cautious exuberance” is named repeatedly but never shown through contradictory in-scene choices; her ledger of silent-contributor stories is declared, not dramatized, so the promised internal conflict stays abstract. The single high-stakes micro-choice—placing the locket on the balcony—feels generous yet costs her nothing we can see; no foreclosed path, no visible trade-off. Interiority drifts into thematic label-speak (“cycles of compassion,” “shared narrative”) rather than embodied tension. Relationships remain off-stage; the lighthouse keeper is a courteous helper, not a crucible, so status and emotional risk are muted.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Arlen’s “boldly sympathetic” trait is repeatedly named but never complicates her choices; she moves through the orchard like a tour guide, not a woman whose empathy costs her anything. No interior contradiction surfaces under pressure—her promise to the unseen artist is pure benevolence, never tested by counter-urge or fatigue. The villagers remain an anonymous chorus, so no relationship crucible can force her stance to shift. The final image of the expanding reed sculpture is lovely, but it feels ordained rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically particular—“sketches could coax the soul from a fossil”—but her decisions are largely reactive: she drifts, listens, watches, then releases the pendant without a prior beat of conscious renunciation or cost. The final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than wrested; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“pendant warm against her skin”) yet never complicates or endangers her. Closure image is resonant but the earned cost is only implicit; the story lands in Charged Poise without showing the price she pays for becoming the echo.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conjurer’s “gently inventive” curiosity and compassionate motive are stated repeatedly but never collide with a credible counter-desire; interiority stays abstract (“felt a pulse of hope”) and no micro-choice risks anything tangible. Emotion is named rather than embodied in gesture or contradiction; the glass-eyes placement is delicate but stakes-free. He undergoes no change beyond a whispered incantation that merely confirms what the orchard already showed him; the cost is atmospheric, not personal. Character passes as functional lyric guide, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crawl-space dweller’s gentle, orderly temperament is present on every page, but only once—when she slots the tape fragment—does it force a trade-off (the risk of exposure). Interiority is mostly atmospheric paraphrase (“she realized…”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile is unearned after no visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lush and botanically precise; the “circuitously sincere” smile is a smart, specificizing hook. The single contradiction—curiosity vs. humility—runs throughout and pays off in the final whispered promise. Micro-choices (coil placement, later greenhouse bowl) are visible, but the middle beat of simply “watching” lets agency wobble. Closure cost is present yet diffuse; a sharper bodily or relational forfeiture would have nailed 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s insomniac painter trait is vivid—“endless parade of colors that refused to settle into sleep”—and her motive to “thresh meaning” is repeatedly voiced, but the interior contradiction never surfaces in a visible micro-choice; the brooch exchange happens to her rather than forcing a wrenching decision, so the cost feels inferred, not embodied. The final stance is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically voiced yet emotionally generic—“visions flickered like lanterns in a storm,” “gentle fire inside her”—without contradictory impulse or visceral cost. Her single micro-choice (stepping forward to whisper) is not pressured by a real risk; the pilgrim and child remain symbolic walk-ons, so relationship crucible is moot. Blind-spot irony (clairvoyant who didn’t see) is announced, never dramatized by a visible mistake that compounds. Result: a serviceable archetype, not a textured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s interiority is concrete—salt-stained wool, brass valve against ribs—yet never spills into self-diagnosis; his contradictory impulse to hoard silence while broadcasting memory is dramatized in the gesture of blowing a soft note that invites others to complete the chord. Micro-choices (lifting the valve, accepting the midnight summons) visibly cost him rest and solitude, earning the communal chorus that ends his exile. The arc is a credible renunciation of isolation, but because no second character shares the pier, status dynamics and relationship crucible remain theoretical; the score peaks just below the 9-band for that absent pressure-test.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically consistent but stays at atmospheric register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The decisive moment—placing the punch beside the ledger—reads as ritual surrender rather than a cost-carrying choice, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. logic—are dramatized in her minute-by-minute handling of the tile and the whales’ song; the notebook, tea, and tile function as externalized micro-choices. The final renunciation—slipping the tile into the alcove—carries visible cost: she surrenders definitive proof yet gains the tower as living archive. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the “courageously kind” trait is asserted twice without being tested under fire, a hairline slip that keeps her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Immortal’s boredom is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“centuries of ennui”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from apathy to purpose is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices; the amulet acts on him more than he acts on it. No visible cost or flaw complicates the epiphany, so the arc feels gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s contradictory drives—inheritance of con-artist tools vs hunger for verifiable honesty—stay alive in every beat; the moment she whispers the cracked-wall formula the internal split crystallizes. Her embodied stillness (“felt in the soles of her feet”) and the micro-choice to slip parchment under the pot show values in hierarchy under pressure. The only bar to 9-band is that the father’s “mathematics” is told more than enacted earlier; still, the ink-payoff reweights her flaw into resolve with visible cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stationer’s motive—collecting “textures of time”—is vivid, but interiority is lyric-paraphrase (“understood that invented histories were bridges”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice visibly forfeits an alternative path, so the renunciation feels abstract, not earned. Embodied emotion is present in moss-light notation yet never peaks to crystallize cost. Still, perceptual signature and consistent obsession keep him individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nameless narrator’s contradictory impulse—clinging to erased identity while becoming an archive for others—remains interior and textural; no second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. Micro-choices (pocketing the label, stepping back from the glowing murals) are present and tied to the lens, but the “felt cost” is more conceptual than embodied. The arc is a credible renunciation of official identity, yet the emotional price is stated (“finally felt a purpose”) rather than shown through bodily cost. Meets the 9+ quick test structurally, but the absence of corporeal stakes caps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Selene’s curiosity-as-trait is clear, but interiority slips into thematic commentary (“universal riddle she was determined to decode”) rather than embodied contradiction. The shell-cello nexus gives her one tactile micro-choice that reweights her goal, yet we get no visible flaw or cost—her smile remains untroubled. Mentor echo is a useful haunt, but it is narrated, not dramatized, so the emotional stakes flatten. Earned stasis is implied; still, the absence of a visible trade-off caps credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s “culture-shock absorber” premise stays ornamental; we are told she “filters chaos” but never see her fail, flinch, or pay a price while doing it. Dual-allegiance tension is announced (“tightrope”) yet never forces a visible sacrifice or micro-choice that costs her standing with either side. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“hopeful desperation”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure. Closure choice—postponement—feels council-level, not hers; her stance crystallizes off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and specific— “a tremor of grief” lodged in the visor’s reflection— but the inspector’s contradictory impulses (scientist vs. elegist) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single choice. His only visible micro-decision is to whisper a valediction, a beat that arrives late and feels safe rather than costly. Still, the voice-driven perception stays individual, never drifting into generic space-poet cliché, so the portraiture remains strong if not quite crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s blindness is never allowed to become a gimmick; every tactile micro-choice (feeling wing curvature, reading light through water) is specific, character-bound, and costly. The interior contradiction—yearning to guide a ship she will never see—remains alive in the final whispered “Feel the lift,” earning Earned Stasis with visible forfeit of her own horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip trembles as she traces the glass—yet the “dry-witted” trait is only asserted, never spoken or shown. The decision to broadcast is motivated, but the prior beat where she “remembered the falcon” is summary, not simultaneous contradiction. The earned cost is the bell toll and the ice crack, both legible, yet the character’s emotional layering stays thin for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tuner’s “infinitely patient” trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a contradictory impulse; he never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible cost. His interiority is limited to lyrical paraphrases of the same calm resolve, so the promised internal conflict stays abstract. Because no flaw or tension surface, the arc is flat—an endurance performance rather than a change—so the closure feels more tableau than earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.1)
    Mara’s interiority never contradicts itself; every beat repeats the same tidy awe. The “epiphany” line bottle the fleeting breath of eternity is pure therapy-speak, no embodied cost. Because her panic dissolves off-page after sniffing perfume, the change feels administered, not earned. The promise to share the scent is declared, never dramatized, so no path is foreclosed with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    The boy’s interiority is lyric and consistent—he is always listening for hush, always guided by the lattice; the moment he steps onto the reef and feels salt sear his feet is a micro-choice that costs. The mother’s vanished absence is an effective blind-spot that compounds his mistake-history. No contradiction is dramatized in-scene, and the ending’s renunciation (story over warning) is an earned stasis, though the emotional gear-shift is compressed into one clause and could have carried more body.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ghost bride’s interiority is lyrically specific (“love that was both gentle and poisonous”), and her micro-choice to release the venomous sigh is embodied and costly. The contradictory impulses—yearning to stay / duty to dissolve—coexist in the same beats, satisfying the 9+ test. Flaw: the bead’s emotional weight is asserted more than dramatized in early beats, a hairline slip that keeps her from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (obedience to guild taboo vs. dream-urge to weave) surface only in abstract assertion, never dramatised in a single beat where she risks tangible reprisal; the “courage to break old laws” is declared, not tested. Interiority is lush but cycles the same lyric labels (“orchid solace,” “hauntingly optimistic”) instead of sharpening under rising risk. Final stance qualifies as Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete (“felt the weight of generations,” “warmly curious heart swelling”) and her micro-choices under pressure—kneeling, placing the disc, turning it—are character-specific. The contradiction between scientific excavation and spiritual re-enchantment is implied but never dramatized in a single sharp moment; the final smile feels slightly epiphanic rather than hard-won. No second character steps on-stage, so status/relationship tests are N/A; still, her flaws (naïve optimism) are shown but do not boomerang with visible cost. Meets the 9+ threshold for embodied motives, but the lack of a palpable price keeps it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered (“the weight of every chalk line”) but remains performative; no contradictory impulse acts in-scene. Her only micro-choice—pressing the envelope to the clipboard—is purely ceremonial, so the ending’s “quiet assurance” feels unearned. The flaw is diagnostic self-awareness instead of embodied tension under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lone protagonist’s motive—“listen for unheard stories”—is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices (each stitch = hypothesis, pause = question). Interiority stays concrete; embodied emotion shows in heat traveling through silk and the final smile. No contradiction or therapy-speak. Cost is conceptual yet felt: ember spent, map released, path foreclosed. The absence of any second character means relationship/status bullets are N/A; headcount clarity is perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The medium’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized (she “realized” rather than acts). The shard-warming beat gives embodied cost, yet the final shift to “fierce tenderness” is summary, not a micro-choice under pressure. No second character means relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is a solitary renunciation that earns its hush, but the absence of visible flaw-compounded mistake keeps it just shy of 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.7)
    The translator’s interiority is lyrically rendered—“shrewdly innocent gleam,” “lotus-hearted ache”—but the contradiction is asserted more than dramatized; we never see her innocence actually complicate her shrewdness in a visible choice. The final micro-choice—sealing the coral droplet—repeats the same tender gesture already shown, so the cost feels incremental rather than decisive. The child remains a symbol, not a second character exerting pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent. Earned stasis is hinted, yet the price is emotional haze rather than a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The artist’s motive—rediscover lost joy—is declared repeatedly but never tested by contradiction or cost; she paints, the wall glows, people smile, end. No interior contradiction, no embodied emotion beyond “she smiled,” no micro-choice that risks anything. The fresco fragment glows, but she never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices; the beat sequence is purely additive. Earned stasis fails because nothing is foreclosed—she simply walks on to the next wall.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s interiority is lyrically specific—“nested awakening within each brushstroke”—but her choices remain largely observational; the single active beat (brush tap) is too late and cost-free to earn a full arc. The absence of flaw or contradiction flattens pressure, so the shift from certainty to curiosity reads as declared rather than dramatized. Still, the perceptual signature is vivid and consistent, keeping her above the stock-mystic threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander’s “spark of defiance” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction; his micro-choices (scattering seed, whispering) are atmospheric, not crucible-level. Dr. Mirabel’s late alignment is a clean external pivot yet lacks prior textual friction. No embodied contradiction under pressure keeps him from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s insomnia and yearning are vivid, but his choices remain largely observational—he “watches,” “discovers,” “whispers gratitude”—rather than active trade-offs that cost him anything on the page. The mission to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” is stated repeatedly yet never tested by a moment where he must renounce or risk something tangible. Interiority is lush but leans toward performed abstraction (“his heart gathered each sorrow like coral”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The arc lands in soft stasis; we feel devotion, not friction.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract—“foxglove regret,” “violet sorrow” diagnose emotion rather than embody it. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the caretaker’s ritual is serene repetition, never forced to choose or lose. The final “softer shade” of regret is asserted, not dramatized; cost is atmospheric, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically textured (“carefully reckless,” “cautious exuberance”) and her micro-choices (tracing glyphs, whispering promises) link motive to action. Yet the emotional stakes stay slightly abstract—no embodied contradiction or visible flaw surfaces under pressure, so the final pledge feels more ritual than cost. Still, her perceptual signature holds and the profession shapes what she notices, satisfying baseline individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—technologist yet custodian of empathy—remains vivid in her tactile handling of the chain; the encoded-rhythm payoff turns her competent calm into earned vulnerability when the valve syncs with “stone ribs.” No diagnostic speak, only embodied stakes. A hairline slip: “slyly heartfelt” is asserted, never shown as a trait that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila’s mourning and re-invention motive is clear from the first paragraph; her micro-choices—slicing the meteorite, tying slivers to birds, mapping dust—embody the stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“balance the weight of her past with the present task”) and links action to emotion without label-speak. The arc from isolation to trusting the birds and the city is legible, but the cost of that trust is asserted rather than felt—no beat shows her risking a bird’s loss or a failed flight. Still, contradiction is present: she both clings to loss and launches it away, giving the closure credible emotional origin.

    The child’s interior contradiction—yearning for sacred thresholds yet fearing their cost—surfaces in the moment his palm meets copper and again when the corridor opens; both beats carry embodied tremor. Motivation stays legible: the hum of the terrace and the grain-whisper tie wonder to maternal absence, forcing him to act. No secondary character supplies live pressure, yet the maze itself functions as antagonist, tightening options. The final renunciation—carrying the code as talisman while stepping into stalks—earns its cost via prior pattern: every wooden ring he traced foreshadowed this forfeiture of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    Aria’s interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“rhythm of belonging”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice visibly costs her anything, so the ending’s “etched” feeling reads asserted, not earned. The burnt feather acts as symbolic prop, not a decision engine. Because she never risks or forfeits an on-page want, the arc stays observational.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s interiority is lyrically specific—“sea-foam recollectionist,” “crater glass shard”—but her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear of forgetting) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-choice; the final “laugh” is the first embodied cost we actually see, so the arc feels lightly earned rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The performer’s quiet, improvisatory micro-choices—tilting bishops, letting ink fall, bowing to the tide—show a consistent, embodied mind in action; interior contradiction is present but mild, never forcing a true reversal or visible renunciation. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, so the arc is a steady-state crystallization rather than a change forced by flaw. The character reads as a singular, memorable consciousness, not a type, and his motives stay legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at a single emotional temperature; the “cosmic verse” motive is declared, not dramatized through contradiction or micro-choice. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are N/A. The final smile registers a shift, yet the cost of exile dissolves into cosmic uplift without a visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“concentric rings breathe, each ripple a sentence”—but the piece never forces her to test her creed against external resistance; the only pressure is her own rapture. The pocketed stone at the end registers as souvenir, not cost, because no live option is foreclosed. She observes value rather than risking anything for it, so the arc is mood, not change.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Arin’s motive—revive communal hope via coded balloons—remains legible, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“mind balancing rigor…whimsy”), never dramatized; he watches rather than chooses under rising risk, so the final declaration feels announced, not earned. No visible cost cleaves to him personally; the needle’s zero lands as communal payoff, not personal renunciation or stake-shift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “ash against her spine” image crystallizes her bodily stake. Yet no contradictory impulse ever splits her; she glides from intent to action without micro-choice that costs her anything on the page, so the arc stays flat. The lineage burden is asserted, not dramatized as a competing pull that complicates her mapping. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the final “warm ash” moment gives a felt, if modest, price.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.4)
    The painter is a luminous archetype, not a person: no contradictory impulses, no micro-choice that costs him anything, no interior contradiction beyond “gentle serenity.” The childhood motive is asserted in one reflective clause but never dramatized or tested; his calm never cracks, so the ending’s “collective dreams” feel bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—war-weary yet still believing in gentleness—surfaces in her tear at the end, but the story tells us “operative gentleness” rather than letting us feel its cost in breath or body earlier. The single micro-choice of placing the clipboard is clean, yet prior beats summarize her aura instead of staging a visible trade-off that would foreclose an alternative path. The chieftains’ softening is externally narrated, so Lira’s agency feels more emblematic than crucible-tested. Still, the endurance of carrying the inked pages supplies credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    The philanthropist’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven drought-maker vs. secret sentimental preservationist—are dramatized in the single decisive act of releasing the egg. His micro-choice (wire-touch, quartz sigh, egg fracture) externalizes the internal split with visible cost: the thunder-lullWindow = 0, so the act is irreversible and self-implicating. The tear of “sand and redemption” at the end embodies the contradiction without tidy resolution, satisfying Earned Stasis. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; headcount default met.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The courtesan’s interiority flickers between embodied lyricism and grand abstraction; her “bodily poetic rhythm” is asserted more than dramatized, so the contradiction that should power her final renunciation is only partially felt. She does make concrete micro-choices—hand on prism, silver thread pulled—and these physical acts earn the ending’s conceptual cost. Still, the absence of any visible flaw or hesitation at the climax keeps the arc just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Selene’s calm, ink-steeped interiority is vivid, but her “ethical storytelling” motive is stated more than dramatized; we see her arranging dishes and cradling the stick, yet no contradictory impulse is tasted under pressure. The moment she imagines puppets “turning toward the audience” is luminous, but it is the only micro-choice that forecloses a path; earlier beats only rehearse the same serenity. Cost is poetic rather than felt—she leaves with a memory, not a scar—so the arc feels more mood than moral crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s quiet arc from collector to guardian is legible and internally coherent; the final knot carries cost as she kneels, “trembling with the weight of histories.” Yet contradictions stay lyrical rather than dramatized—no moment forces her to choose between competing goods or suffer an external setback. Interiority is vivid but loops on its own lyric register (“blushing stillness” repeated) without tightening under pressure. For 700 words the motivation suffices, yet the absence of live opposition keeps the characterization just above mid-strong.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but drifts into self-diagnosis (“after forgiving yourself…”) that flattens contradiction. The “technically gentle” trait is asserted, never tested against a moment where gentleness costs her. Because the rope and cylinder do the active work, her agency feels supervisory; the emotional thaw is vivid but not earned through a visible choice that risks anything. She changes, yet the change is given, not wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation—why paths choose walkers—remains atmospheric curiosity rather than a pressure-forged want; we are told she “believed” interpretation could transcend perception, yet no contradiction or micro-choice dramatizes this belief under threat. Interiority lapses into lyrical tag-lines (“tangled her thoughts like vines”) instead of embodied contradiction. Final transcendence is granted by the forest, not earned through a visible sacrifice or renunciation; cost is cosmically implied, not personally paid. Voice is consistent, but the arc is observation→gift rather than flawed choice→consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nabu’s thrift and star-hunger collide in every beat; the grain-ration memory (“measured every grain of barley”) directly motivates the midnight risk with the tile. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic—his humor at the “universe’s tight ledger” is an embodied micro-choice under pressure. The final stance—still counting, now blessed—earns its hush of cost by foreclosing a return to ordinary poverty. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, only stated, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s pacifist scheming is clear and consistent, but her interiority stays at a meditative distance; we see her plan and watch it work, yet feel no contradictory impulse or visible cost to her. The monks’ conversions are sketched as a chain of identical beats without individuated friction, so the “change” reads as smooth miracle rather than earned struggle. Closure satisfies the lens (accumulative/lyric) but the absence of a personal price for Mara caps credibility at high-band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlen’s interiority is lyrically concrete—“cold fog curl into his lungs”—and his rhythmic breathing micro-choices embody the craft. Yet the dream’s pull is asserted more than dramatized; we never feel him risk anything tangible he might lose. The final “promise to guard” is earned by the synchronized-breath ordeal, so renunciation carries cost, but the lack of external resistance keeps stakes interior and slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is textured—her boots “stirring fallen leaves” shows embodied vigilance—and the deciduous-vow metaphor lets her contradictory impulses (cling to guild pride vs. embrace orchard wisdom) act in the same breath. The micro-choice to kneel and use the bag contents is character-specific, but the “feisty spark” is asserted rather than demonstrated through risk or impatience; we never see her snap or gamble. Mira functions only as witness, so the relationship crucible is absent; the cost is present but diffuse (lost guild claim) rather than personally sharpened in-scene. Still, the final stance crystallizes under a visible price—she vows seasonal return—meeting the 9+ quick test for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“already simply complicated” mind wrestling with backward-growing vines—but the curator’s final acceptance is more declared than earned by dramatized micro-choices; the bathroom epiphanies repeat the same beat rather than deepening risk. Embodied emotion (luminous pollen on skin) is specific, yet the emotional cost is conceptual rather than felt, so the renunciation reads as graceful but lightly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Selene’s linguist-scholar identity is declared but never tested; we never see her parse a single syllable under pressure. Her “carefully resourceful” label is repeated but not embodied—no trade-off, risk, or visible mistake. The diary hand-off is the only micro-choice, and it feels pre-arranged rather than wrestled with. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are absent; competence is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lush but diffuse; “half-remembered maps” and “stitched feathers” evoke wonder yet never sharpen into contradictory impulse. No micro-choice under pressure shows flaw or cost; the garden quest is accepted without resistance or trade-off. Voice is singular, but the absence of visible error or sacrifice keeps the arc below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s “singular” motivation is declared repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction; her calm cataloguer persona never buckles, so the promised translation of confusion into clarity feels pre-ordained. The final “warmth of method in her bones” is identical to her opening stance—no visible cost, no renunciation—so the arc is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is mostly sensory and goal-driven (“he began…examining crack patterns”); the mapkeeper’s etched skin and silver pulses give a vivid bodily anchor. Yet his emotional state stays on a single calm-desire plane; no contradictory impulse ever contests the quest for quiet, so the arc is smooth rather than pressured. The final smile is earned, but the cost is atmospheric, not personal—he never risks or loses anything on-page—so the “visible cost” bar for 9+ isn’t quite cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation—“prove coincidences have meaning”—is declared repeatedly yet never tested by a contradictingchoice; custodian acts only in calm ritual, no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“thistle-blown hope” loop) instead of concrete stakes. Final vow costs nothing visible; no path foreclosed, so Earned Stasis remains theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archivist’s “preemptive nostalgia” is a vivid label, but it never hardens into a concrete, costly choice; he observes, conjectures, records, yet nothing is risked or foreclosed. Interiority is lyrically sketched but loops in summary (“feeling grief for moments not yet lived”) without contradicting impulses enacted in scene. The final smile and resolve land as a mood shift rather than a stance paid for by prior causality; the cost is atmospheric, not character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Designer’s interiority stays lyric-lyrical (“serious playfulness” repeated) rather than concrete under pressure; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. His sole micro-choice—lifting the rag knot—repeats without escalating cost. The vow at the end is closure-adjacent but feels additive, not paid for by prior causality. Flaw is label-speak, not embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The chronicler’s desire to “feel how moments stretched and folded” is vivid, yet she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; she merely watches. Interiority is lush but external risk is absent, so the arc is observational, not crucible-tested. The jade cicada’s glow is credited with shifting the leaders, not her agency, keeping motivation ornamental. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized—she closes her notebook unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lio’s hunger to “taste” silence is palpable and idiosyncratic, driving every beat; the moment he inhales the filaments and feels fear dissolve is an embodied micro-choice that visibly re-prioritizes his hierarchy of needs. Interiority stays concrete (“his chest a rubber band nearing its limit”) rather than diagnostic. The porcelain doll is never handled in a second, contrasting beat, so the object-relationship stagnates, capping the arc just short of exceptional. Still, the ending’s Earned Stasis—he accepts perpetual bunker life but now carries an internal sky—pays a felt cost and is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lira’s motive—“to teach silence how to comfort”—is declared early but never tested by a contradictory impulse; she glides through the beats unruffled. No interior contradiction surfaces when the vial’s silver cascades, so the moment reads as serene performance rather than costly choice. Because her stance never collides with an alternative, the promised “earned stasis” feels more label than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“weight of histories tug at her sleeves”) and motivation stays single-track; no contradiction under pressure. The final endurance on the throne is foreshadowed by the flake’s steady pulse, so the renunciation feels earned. Yet micro-choices are narrated rather than dramatized (all ascent beats are summary), so the cost is legible but not viscerally felt in a high-pressure instant. Still, within lyric-accumulative mode this satisfies the 9- gate: flawed but touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The keeper’s paradoxical mission to “teach suffocating darkness to breathe” is vividly interiorized through repeated, embodied contact with the sanctuary; contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) coexist in the same beats. Motivation stays consistent and scales to the final renunciation—leaving the ring—yet the lack of any second character or tangible opposition limits relational crucible pressure, capping depth at strong rather than exceptional. Micro-choices (each footfall, each ember placed) do reveal a hierarchy of values, but the cost is more atmospheric than corporeal; a sharper physical stake or irrecoverable loss would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s past as a pyramid-scheme survivor is invoked more as label than as a live, contradictory impulse. The “righteous mischief” moment late is vivid, but the interior contradiction between past trauma and present trust is told rather than embodied in a micro-choice that costs. Interiority tends toward abstraction (“quantum promise felt different–like a song”) without concrete, character-specific sensorium. Voice remains coherent, yet the emotional engine never fully torque under pressure because the bolt, not the psyche, takes the final risk.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lian’s curiosity is clear, but the text tells us he “hopes” and “realizes” rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene; the final insight feels arrived at rather than earned through visible micro-choice. The cost—ancestral shame—is present yet abstract, so the emotional price is felt only lightly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The knight’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; “capture the shape of possibility” is repeated rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure; the armor-melt is passive, not a willed renunciation, so the change feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    Amelia’s interiority is lyrical but stays safely in reflective summary; the “broken-hearted” label is repeated rather than dramatized through contradictory on-page choices. The micro-choice of placing the button on the ledger is the only moment where motive visibly alters action; no later choice is similarly tested. Emotional cost is asserted (“heart still broken”) rather than embodied in a visible trade-off at closure. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s “quiet smile” and “fierce resolve” remain abstract labels; no embodied contradiction plays out under pressure. Her single on-page choice—inserting the key—springs from prior label, not dramatized interior friction, so the cost feels generic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is legible—silence the prophecy—but interiority stays abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure beyond “whisper not roar.” The father memory is the only concrete cue, yet it doesn’t tilt present tactics. Earned stasis feels assumed rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s quiet, ritualized devotion is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mossy delight of centuries-old bark”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the final transformation is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels smoothed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s curiosity about broken gears is concrete and particular; her decision to follow the compass is embodied through tactile handling of tools and moss-lit staging. Interior contradiction is light—mainly the intellectual thrill of paradox—so the arc feels more observational than crucible. The final “uncertainly certain” smile is earned by the waterfall scene, but emotional cost stays ambient rather than visceral. Still, her perceptual signature (smell of ozone, erratic clock-ticks) individualizes her throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—seeking empirical precision yet chasing a “mystical” ledger—anchors her, but the dragon-name she twice utters never acquires a private resonance; we are told it trembles the coin, not shown how it chafes against her scales-bearing habit. Micro-choices (temperature read, gold pour) are tactile, yet the ultimate renunciation—accepting the luminous regret as “quiet gratitude”—is stated rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Still, her obsessive measurer stance is consistent and her flaw (belief that naming can fix both metal and self) compounds neatly into the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s “modestly fearless” stance is shown through her steady advance into the gorge, but the interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the crocodile-tooth artifact gives her an external cue, so the moment of genuine fear/courage overlap is only sketched. Her micro-choice to risk the joke is the single visible pivot, yet the cost (exposure to hostile spirits) is announced, not felt on the body, so the endurance registers as safe. The collector identity stays atmospheric; we never see her decide whether to pocket or abandon a soul, so the occupation is costume more than crucible. Still, the final laugh-charged tooth glows as a concrete reconfiguration, giving her arc a legible before/after under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s survivor status and embodied trauma responses feel authentic; the mask strap as tactile anchor keeps memory present in muscle. Interiority stays concrete—“lattice of bruised memories” is shown via flinch reactions and foot-fall math. The final renunciation of the strap lands as earned stasis because every violet flash has visibly tightened the choice. The healing equation is stated once, but it grows from prior sensory data, so the epiphany avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    The translator’s interiority is vivid—concrete sensory memory of father’s “glowing heart” in palm anchors vocation. Micro-choice chain (trace gull wing → align fragment → release into void) externalizes intuition under pressure. Cost is legible: dissolution of relic and self-into-wind renunciation, closing the child-to-now arc. Voice lapses into lyric echo-chamber twice (“time itself is a series of anchors…”) that edges toward performed profundity, trimming full 9.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s perceptual gift is concrete—dust patterns, mirror glints, mainspring pulse—but her interiority stays external. We see her act and notice, yet never learn why ghosts matter personally; the only cost is a “feather-light” gratitude that feels weightless rather than priced. The ledger retrieval changes nothing about her tactics or self-concept; it merely rewards attention. Competence is vivid, but contradiction and genuine struggle are missing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s desire to “compress eternity into a moment” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an interior contradiction; she moves from receiver to actor without visible cost or doubt. The moment she “decides” has no备选路径 foreclosed, so the change feels declared, not earned. Embodiment is strong—ink-stained fingers, frost tracing—but emotion stays performative (“she realized…”) rather than conflicted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s “burnished sorrow” and her pivot from insurrectionist to myth-maker are vivid and embodied; contradictory impulses (triumph/regret, loss/creation) braid through every micro-choice. The shard-in-pocket final gesture crystallizes a credible renunciation—her revolution now lives in reflected light, not rifles. Only the absence of another on-page character keeps this from full crucible pressure; the interior arc is otherwise complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alder’s interiority stays concrete—his tactile, rhythmic mending and the amber glow threading through the rust give embodied emotion. Yet the promised flaw (tendency toward passivity) never surfaces; the covenant tests his honesty only in abstract, so the Earned Stasis feels inherited rather than individually paid. The “reclaim the light” motive is signaled early but does not visibly clash with other wants, so the hierarchy of values stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s sensibly eccentric trait is shown through her obsessive cataloguing of rain-scent and her calm descent into a water-stair, but interiority is largely poetic rather than contradictory-under-pressure. The final “quiet surrender” arrives as a conceptual beat rather than a visibly costly renunciation, so the change feels more observed than earned. Still, her actions align with her vocation and the compass psychometry gives her a tactile, character-specific way to perceive stakes. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mira’s “spirited driftwood sculptor” label is repeated but never dramatized—no tool in hand, no splinter under fingernail, no trade-off between vision and wood. Interiority drifts into generic wisdom-speak (“each scar a chapter”) rather than concrete, contradictory impulses. Her final decision to build a “layered tableau” arrives as a narrated epiphany without micro-visible cost; we never see her refuse or sacrifice anything on the page. The learning trait stays ornamental, not operational.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s obsession with night-blooming flowers is concrete and childhood-anchored, giving her a sharp interior contradiction between wonder and winter-doubt. The postcards function as an embodied memory-tool, charging every beat inside the cathedral; her micro-choice to align one postcard with the glass triggers the climactic vision. The tears and “new rhythm” show earned emotional shift, though the hush/bloom metaphor is stated more than dramatized. Internal conflict is present but softened by lyric summary rather than a gritty, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “searing reverie” is vividly internalized; every beat of decoding and descent is driven by her need to broadcast erased voices. The contradictory pull—fear of the trap vs. compulsion to remember—peaks when she risks temporal disorientation by touching the diary-light. Micro-choices (arranging shells at 3 a.m., dipping her hand into obsidian) map a clear hierarchy: truth > safety. The final smile is credibly earned: exhaustion, resolve, and the lifted weight of an archive once mute.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist’s refusal of “false comfort” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a costly fork; interiority drifts into abstraction (“memory-woven streets”) rather than embodied contradiction. His motives remain monolithic—restore via memory—so the micro-choices are purely procedural, not value-testing. The promised return at the end is a pledge, not an earned renunciation with visible price. Interiority never fractures under pressure; hence no contradictory impulse is felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Harel’s contradictory impulses—duty to archive vs. the orchard’s living memory—surface in embodied micro-choices (lifting the cylinder, sealing vellum with his own ink). The final renunciation (recording the prophecy he was never meant to hear) carries visible cost: his ink-blood seals the loop, foreclosing innocence. Interiority stays concrete and language-bound; no diagnostic self-labeling. One slip: the “faint smile” feels externally observed, a rare moment of performed emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s calm-in-crisis temperament is shown through sensorial anchoring (rough-bark acorn, cold perfume), but her contradictory “storm of calm” is stated more than dramatized. The lineage duty is clear, yet no micro-choice visibly risks anything she could lose; the surrender happens in lyrical summary rather than a beat we watch her pay for. The vortex ingestion is passive—she “allows” it—so the cost feels ambient, not personally extracted. Voice stays coherent, but interiority leans poetic-declarative (“quiet hunger,” “wild serenity”) rather than idiosyncratic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is poetic but generic; “humble,” “credibly curious” are asserted, not embodied. The micro-choice to wait for glue to dry is concrete, yet no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates him. The renunciation of noise for listening is declared rather than dramatized with cost. Voice remains atmospheric, not individual.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.7)
    The janitor’s interiority is lush—contradictory impulses swirl around loss, caretaking, cosmic scale—but no on-page micro-choice actually alters his tactics or forecloses a path. Empathy is asserted, not dramatized as a costly decision. Closure is a lyrical stasis, not an earned renunciation with visible price. For 700 words this is still compelling, yet the missing visible cost caps the arc below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    Interiority is lyrically dense but abstract; “astonished recluse” never dramatizes a specific contradiction in-scene. All gestures—gaze, lift, trace—are calm, so the alleged astonishment is never embodied or paid for. No micro-choice visibly narrows his options; he simply endures, so the renunciation feels assumed, not earned. The only cost named is “weight of unspoken words,” but that weight is asserted, not staged through bodily or spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s “texture-of-time” craving is vivid in her body (“felt the texture she craved…thin silk”), but her only consequential choice is placing the urn fragment; everything else is observation or ledger reading, so the agency-to-cost ratio feels thin. The interior contradiction is asserted (“borrowed-time timekeeper”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice that could fail. Closure relies on external luminescence rather than a renunciation or charged stance that would foreclose a path with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but diffuse; the “warmly attentive heart” is declarative, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse undercuts the poet’s single-minded reverence, so pressure stays flat. The final vow is earnest but cost-free, keeping the arc in stasis rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is evocative—her “brazen calm” and ritualized wire-wrapping embody a believable, contradiction-rich stance under death sentence. Yet the diary never becomes a tool that forces a micro-choice or reveals a limit; it stays observational, so the final survival beat feels like grace rather than earned botanic-copper causality. Still, her embodied rhythms and the visible cost of dawn-to-dusk labor let her pivot from doomed caretaker to mythic bridge; the council’s reversal is credible because her calm has infected the islanders on page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arin’s “luminous skeptic” and “academically rebellious” tags stay active: he questions the alien-worship narrative and performs his amber experiment. Interiority is concrete (“curious defiance,” “defiant heart”), motives escalate from doubt to reciprocal gesture, and the final renunciation—offering the dim ember—carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails; characterization is strong but not quite exceptional.

    The coachman’s listening priesthood and ancestral mission provide a clear, embodied motive; interiority stays concrete (“his tongue shaping sounds that no living ear had heard”). Yet the emotional arc is static—no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is tested under pressure, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rook’s transition from body-finder to memory-keeper is anchored in sensory memory and a single, embodied bark-choice that re-opens the chest; the interior contradiction between duty and fatigue is implied rather than dramatized in-scene, muting cost. Micro-choices (nudge, bark, seal) show values, yet no visible failure or friction with another will keeps the arc shy of full crucible pressure. Still, the moment he re-waxes the leaf the path forecloses with quiet weight, earning a credibly limited change.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    A single, nameless “I” carries the piece; interiority is lyrically sustained but abstract (“confusion melt into quiet resolve” is told, not dramatized). The compass applique and sketching ritual act as concrete proxies for desire, yet no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is shown under pressure; the stance is static contemplation rather than tested character. Motivation is coherent—grief transmuted into cartographic pilgrimage—but the lack of embodied friction or visible flaw keeps the arc emotionally flat. Still, the voice-locked solitude and consistent idiom make the protagonist feel specific within the elegiac mode.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lysander’s motives are lyrically stated but never sharpened into a concrete contradiction; the “centuries-old betrayal” stays abstract, so the final swap feels symbolic rather than personally costly. Interiority is lush but generic—no micro-choice shows him weighing real loss. The closure beat (“his own soul expand”) is told, not embodied. Competence dominates; struggle is cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira’s interiority is evocative—her eyes “carrying the paradox of feigned terror and felt teeth” lands—but her contradictory impulses are described rather than dramatized in scene; she never faces a live moment where rehearsed reflex collides with real crisis. The benevolently-ruthless trait is asserted twice but produces no visible trade-off or micro-choice under pressure. The mission to chronicle “small gestures” is declared, not tested; she never rejects an easier path or pays an on-page cost for it, so the final stance feels pre-ordained. Closure earns quiet gravitas, yet the emotional arc is more stated than struggled.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s hunger for a “shape of home” is palpable and embodied—every feather-stroke on the stone is a micro-choice that reweights her interior map. The moment she opens the mercury-skin book and inhales pine-rain-lullaby, memory becomes a viscered stake rather than a label. However, the childhood courtyard shard is narrated more than dramatized, so the cost feels recalled rather than re-lived. Still, her final renunciation—laying the stone back—earns credible stasis and keeps contradiction alive inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is textured—"fidgets productively," "paradox of calm rage"—and the pawn-memory anchors guilt. Yet the self-forgiveness turn leans therapeutic ("he let go of the pawn") rather than dramatized; no fresh micro-choice in the climax proves the change. Still, the single-POV arc is coherent and the embodied anxiety carries most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s defiance is vivid in her chalk-sketches and whispered cues, but her interior contradiction—innocent mischief vs. sacrificial resolve—remains stated rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The moment she lifts the final brushstroke carries cost, yet the leap from playful instigator to self-offering feels telescoped; one more micro-choice under duress would have let the trait sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—uncertainty vs. the resolve to mend—remains abstract; we never see a micro-choice that risks anything tangible. The charm-warming is the closest beat, but it’s reactive, not decisive. Closure is an emotional shift rather than an earned renunciation. Still, the embodied pacing and corrosive inhalation keep her from sliding into pure symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.7)
    The painter’s interiority is textured—melancholy, sensory, artist-specific—but remains curiously static; no contradictory impulse is forced to the surface until the final beat, and even then the “promise” is accepted without visible struggle or cost. The shell-key reveal is accepted with trembling fingers but no micro-choice that could have gone another way; thus the arc is more recognition than transformation. Still, the perceptual filter of “colors that linger longer than the tides” keeps the voice from generics.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrical but coherent—her trembling voice, the vial as extension of will, the tear-glint all embody intent. The only fully dramatized choice is releasing the cork; the earlier “whisper promise” is summary, so the cost feels soft. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Earned stasis qualifies: she stays on the balcony, path foreclosed by the sea’s sigh, but the tightening beat wants more micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Navigator’s motive is vivid—mapping loss via midnight calls—but she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; the engine-building is reported, not dramatized, so interior contradiction and embodied cost stay abstract. The censer foot warms in sync with her pulse, yet that correlation is stated, not tested under pressure. A single micro-choice—refuse a coordinate, risk the station—would have pushed this to 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s “involuntary truthfulness” is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her forced to blurt anything costly in-scene. The interior rationale for hiding the eye is paraphrased rather than pressured; her decision to install it as communal mirror arrives as an abstract pivot, not a micro-choice with visible stakes. The smugglers remain silhouettes, so status/relationship crucible is absent. Still, the truffle-forager occupation is woven into action and the final stewardship role gives her a credible after-stance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlowe’s interiority is textured—opal reflections as “his own isolation,” the Edelweis “pulsed against his heart”—and his micro-choices (aligning flower with tide’s longest lull, lighting the lamp) visibly cost him rest and solitude. The alpine/salt contradiction supplies a lived-in flaw, not a label. No second character on stage, so relationship bullet waived. Renunciation of sleep and embrace of lifelong vigil earns Earned Stasis closure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; the “lingering promise” is told rather than embodied, and his moment of choice—placing the chip—lacks micro-cost or visible hesitation. No contradictory impulses in scene; the arc is acceptance rather than struggle, so the change feels pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.7)
    The queen’s “disenchantment” is asserted, not embodied; interiority drifts into cosmic lyricism (“starlight poured into her veins”) without grounding her contradictory impulses in-scene. No micro-choice shows her crown’s weight altering tactics; the orb-burst enlightenment is接收而非争取得来. The retinue functions as backdrop shadows; status crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    Alchemist’s interiority is poetic but generic; “directed spontaneity” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged; choices are group rituals, not individual micro-decisions under pressure. Friends function as a chorus; no status shifts or interpersonal cost register. Closure is a sentimental vow rather than an earned renunciation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lucid-dream chronicler’s ambition to “distill chaos into narrative” gives us a concrete motive and produces two visible micro-choices—unrolling the scroll, then writing “furiously” after the dream. Interiority is evocative (“the letters rearrange themselves as if jealous”) but still drifts toward performed nostalgia-speak (“feral nostalgia… jaded wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction. No enduring flaw or status shift is dramatized; the grave vision evaporates without forcing a tactic change, so the final stance feels more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s anosmia and tactile faith are vivid, but the piece never lets her make a risky micro-choice that could fail; the repair proceeds without setback or contradiction, so the “miracle” feels pre-assured rather than earned. The interiority is lush yet curiously static—no moment where her mapped terrain collides with an unexpected resistance that would cost her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“breath between storms,” “luminous rune of purpose”—but the arc is purely cathartic; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is dramatized, so the transformation feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The exorcist’s guilt and need to apologize feel genuine, but interiority leans on abstract perfume/”induced currents” shorthand rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (placing bottle, arranging pages) are present yet read ritualized rather than risky; cost is declared (“weight of ash”) more than dramatized. Relationship with Mara is off-stage memory only, so status crucible and secondary pressure bullets don’t activate. Closure choice—whisper apology into orchard wind—earns some credit as renunciation, but causality to prior flaws is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The witness’s interior contradiction—seeking truth while erasing self—is dramatized through the literal retreat of her shadow; the dictionary, handled in three beats, externalizes memory and decays with her. Micro-choice under pressure (placing the book on the crystal) costs her corporeal presence, an earned vanishing. Yet the “end-of-history” vocation is asserted more than lived; we get no biographical flaw or misbelief that complicates the ritual, so the arc edges toward archetype rather than individual. Still, the embodiment of extinction as bodily fade-out gives the reader a visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The shepherd’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the ritualized duty of counting—is present but stays abstract; no micro-choice is dramatized that visibly risks failure or social cost. His “peculiar” calling is named repeatedly yet never complicates action; the mantle key hums but does not force a decision. The ending renunciation is therefore felt as mood, not as a path foreclosed by prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.1)
    The interiority is evocative ("quiet wildfire calm") yet drifts into lyrical abstraction that tells emotional state rather than dramatizing contradiction. The specialist’s spatial gift is asserted repeatedly but never tested in a moment of costly failure or surprise; the laser calibration feels frictionless. "Letting go" is treated as a mantra, not a flawed need that collides with a live risk. No secondary character applies tangible pressure, so the crucible is interior but undercooked.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s inheritance of gambling compulsion collides with her academic rigor in scene-embedded micro-choices—placing the coin, tracing the 7:11 ratio—so the interior contradiction is live. Yet the mother’s death is summarized rather than felt in body or choice, blunting the promised emotional cost. Still, the final ledger entry shows credible renunciation with visible price, satisfying the 600-word closure bar.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s isolation and mission are stated rather than dramatized; we never see her hesitate, sacrifice, or risk anything concrete. The interior contradiction between estrangement and communion is asserted, not embodied in a beat where she must choose. The final “stepping out” is symbolic but cost-free on the page, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archivist’s motive—preserve small moments—remains abstract; no concrete contradiction or micro-choice raises the stakes. He observes, writes, and feels, but the locket never forces a costly decision; interiority is lyrically voiced yet static. The ending’s “promise to the night” re-states, rather than tests, his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s “desperately jocular” mask is repeatedly embodied—jokes about broken signals, “laugh that sounded like a rusted hinge”—and the contradiction between quips and mission stakes is visible on the page. The micro-choice to accept the caretaker’s ivy-pattern puzzle is motivated by her prior creed of “polite anarchy” and reciprocity, so the final relinquishment of the moon fragment feels earned. Interiority sometimes drifts into abstract labels—“network of empathy,” “cycle of isolation”—that soften the specificity promised by her logistics background. Still, the jocular trait actively shapes tactics and the climax, satisfying the 9+ test at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to map emotion yet denying sight—is dramatized in every beat: she douses with her ring, absorbs sorrow through skin, and finally renounces external cartography. The renunciation costs her the safety of known paths, shown when she turns back “toward the forest entrance” having internalized the stillpoint. No stock therapy-speak; emotions live in fingertip pulses and ring vibrations. Skin-language trait and ring-compass dowsing constrain every choice; the climax fuses them into a single harmonic chord whose price is permanent vulnerability to every tongue the forest breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is evocative—“confidently uncertain” paradox anchors voice—but emotional embodiment drifts into abstract pulses and tides. Micro-choice is present (pen twist, whisper) yet stakes feel intellectualized; no bodily cost or irreversible decision scars the page. The shift from chaos to ordered rows is declared, not dramatized through visible failure/sweat. Still, narrator’s perceptual signature stays consistent and flaw-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlen’s contradictory motives—yearning to “soothe the forgotten” while engineering erasure of himself—are dramatized in embodied gestures: the empty shutter-clicks that bruise the night. His micro-choice to aim the lens at darkness, not memory, crystallizes a hierarchy of values: anonymity > acclaim. The final vanishing into mist is a credible renunciation foreshadowed by his earlier refusal to be seen. Interiority stays concrete, though the beat-to-beat emotional layering is slightly uniform, preventing full 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The arsonist’s contradictory impulses—burning to preserve—are dramatized in the scorched-circle discovery; his tactile tracing of the tapestry keeps emotion embodied. Yet the three-year ellipsis and sudden mentor promise feel retro-fitted, so the final renunciation, while visible, lacks a prior cost that was dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lira’s “quiet rebellion” is only label until the drumming begins; once she taps the crystal leaves the embodied emotion arrives and motives crystallise. The interior shift from passive defiance to deliberate conduit is legible, but the prior paragraphs lean on abstract emotional tags (“shared dream,” “longing they could not name”) rather than specific contradiction under pressure. The final endurance—continuing to drum softly after the cosmos exhales—earns a modest stasis with cost, yet the story summarises rather than dramatizes the staff’s protocol change, so the ultimate consequence is felt at second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Milo’s stubborn curiosity and methodical ritualism are vivid; his interiority is filtered through sensory particulars (“electric tang on his skin”). The final pocketing of the coin is a credible micro-choice that completes his arc, though the absence of any visible cost prevents a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    The guardian’s interiority is purely ornamental—“silent empathy” is asserted, never embodied. No contradictory impulses, micro-choices, or visible cost emerge; the figure remains a static allegory. The ending “smile within its mirrored gaze” is summary label-speak, unmotivated by any prior dramatized tension. Consequently the required renunciation/endurance feels un-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically voiced (“heard unspoken words in the rustle of pages”) but stays at a single poetic register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Her decision chain—grotto → windows → saplings—is declared rather than shown through micro-choices that cost her anything on the page. The magnetic grotto vibrates, yet she already agrees with its mission, so the object offers no friction to sharpen traits. Result: a sympathetic silhouette, not a pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior tug-of-war—protect the harbor vs. flee it—remains embodied in every beat (cradling crates while whispering the whale-hymn). The scrimshaw’s weight against her palm acts as a tactile reminder of inherited violence, forcing micro-choices that escalate to the altar renunciation. The final stance crystallizes when she releases the bone; cost is the ache of an empty hand now carrying the island’s pulse inside her ribcage. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-help; longing stays salty and calloused.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s contradictory interiority—carving lightness while emotionally void—plays in-scene and drives every beat; the blank-face device externalizes her detachment and the mandate’s pressure without over-labeling. Her final smile is an earned, ambiguous renunciation that costs her any public affect, foreclosing both rebellion and compliance. The one flaw is that the bouquet’s cost is more asserted than bodily felt; still, the micro-choices around cedar shavings keep motive legible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s aesthetic drive is repeatedly declared but never complicates his choices; no contradictory impulse or tangible cost is dramatized. Interiority floats in lyrical abstracts (“watercolor of doubts and dreams”) rather than body-specific tension. The closing “thank you” to stone is the only micro-choice, arriving too late to test motive under pressure. Motivation remains atmospheric, not operational.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Selene’s “innocently cunning” trait is shown through micro-choices—arranging ferns, coaxing ivy—but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“fractured palette of her own sight”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The final renunciation of perfection is earned by the reed-driven pattern, yet the cost is only asserted, not felt in a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell-ringer’s curiosity is vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“powerfully gentle”) rather than dramatized in a moment of tension; micro-choices are present yet cost feels diffuse because no path is foreclosed. Emotional embodiment is strong (“low, velvety hum that seemed to caress the air”) but peaks in static wonder rather than a decisive stance. The closing “ready to question again” reiterates intent without new stakes, so the pilgrimage’s price stays atmospheric, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Grief and craft fuse convincingly in her fingertips, but the “genuinely artificial” paradox is asserted rather than dramatized as an inner contradiction. Interiority is lush yet occasionally drifts into self-diagnosis (“she understood that…”) instead of raw split-second impulse. The final oath is earned, but the rose-transformation is more symbolic than an action that visibly costs or changes her craft. Still, her embodied copper-stained grief and the micro-choice to trace the stencil onto living stem keep her from sliding into allegorical cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cartomancer’s “steadily curious” trait is shown through her tactile, methodical use of the tape and cards; her interiority stays concrete (“the resistance of memory” rather than labels). The final smile and walk into the night feel earned because her spiral-mapping has visibly cost her time, sweat, and the inherited weight of family ledgers. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict bullet is missed, and the cap is enforced.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The historian’s motive—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma; interiority lapses into lyrical labels (“anguished joy”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices exist—irregular steps—but they are described in summary, not dramatized, so no cost is legible. The arc amounts to a mood passage rather than a credible shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dusk noticer’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; his contradictory impulses are asserted (“luminous regret” vs “gratitude”) rather than dramatized through micro-choice under pressure. No visible cost is paid for the metamorphose he undergoes; the stone warms, but he neither risks nor forfeits anything. His motives remain static observer-ideals rather than escalating wants that force tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured—her “quiet turbulence” and the candle-wind image feel embodied—but the moment of shedding her own “preconceived judgments” is narrated rather than dramatized, so the cost of change is only asserted. The chameleon’s approving pulse is charming yet anthropomorphic, blurring the creature’s agency and hers. Still, her micro-choices (placing the vial on the warm stone, laying out shards) track a credible arc from shaken to steadied.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “closure-seeker” identity is vividly interiorized—tracing coffee rings to read scars is a character-specific ritual that turns embodied memory into agency. Emotions stay physical (cool stone, meteor hush) rather than diagnostic. The final renunciation—accepting that every new wound is a doorway—pays off the opening motive with visible cost: the hourglass is now tucked away, a quiet forfeiture of control. Micro-choices (aligning sand with ring pattern, descending tunnel) consistently braid external action with internal contradiction, earning the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority is lush and poetic, but the crystal gazer remains a mystic cipher: no contradiction, flaw, or cost undercuts her calm mastery. Every action is serene success—no visible struggle, error, or emotional back-pressure—so the “earned” quality required for 9+ is missing. Her final whispered goodbye costs her nothing the reader can feel; the love simply floods in without price. At this length, a single visible fracture or risk would have humanized her and lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dreamer’s want-to-free-creativity motive is signaled early and steers every beat; interiority stays concrete (“cold stone cool his pulse”). No second character, so no crucible, yet the brass instrument becomes an extension of self, its rising glow evidencing micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—leaving the device yet carrying its chorus—lands as earned stasis with visible cost. Flaws: late epiphanic shorthand (“freedom”) approaches label-speak, blunting full visceral punch.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The guard’s dreamlessness is a vivid, embodied absence—his pulse tugged by a lullaby he cannot hear—and the micro-choice to lift the clock and whisper the charm turns interior contradiction into costly action. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness—“a reminder that even the most barren souls can be kindled”—that briefly flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority hums with bespoke diction (“luminous echo,” “rusted shut”) that fuses mind and forest; the gear-in-chest moment embodies motive and contradiction. Yet the arc is linear wonder—no genuine flaw complicates or forecloses a path—so the “reclamation” feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically sustained—her grip on the star-stamped ticket registers as pulse, not symbol—but the “unused courage” motive is stated more than dramatized until the cave moment. The ferry guides remain scenic chorus; their silver eyes never harden into choice or risk, so relationship-pressure is absent. Earned stasis is implied yet the cost (what she forfeits by leaving) stays off-page. Voice is coherent and emotionally particular; still, the climax leans on abstract map-tracing rather than a contradictory micro-choice that forces loss.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bellhop’s muteness is a strong external constraint, but his interiority is only gestured at through ritual (placing the bolt). Guests remain a blurred collective; no individual micro-choices under pressure. The earned stance—accepting silence as safety’s price—is present but distributed across a group, softening personal cost. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are implied rather than dramatized in a single character.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is present (“trembling fingers,” “quiet pride”) yet remains generic; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. Micro-choice at crown-touch is singular but credible under short-scope. “Regally unpretentious” is label-only; no visible trade-off. Closure renunciation is earned, cost felt, satisfying 600-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s grief-anchored attention and Eli’s quieter mentorship feel lived-in; the coral witness backstory is shown through dawn ritual, not told. Interior contradiction surfaces in her periodic-eternal loop—wanting to read erased paths yet fearing their silence. The final micro-choice to trust the canyon coordinate costs her the safety of ignorance, earned by prior tapping beats. Eli stays secondary; his pressure is ambient, not relational, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t activate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    The barefoot stargazer is sketched with evocative constellation-map jacket and opera glasses, giving her a memorable silhouette, but interiority is abstract (“awkward confidence bloom”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The stone’s hum triggers her decision, yet the causality is mystical rather than character-driven; the final vow feels willed by theme, not by prior flaw or desire. She remains largely a receptor for the setting’s magic, so the “earned stasis” carries conceptual but not personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Anara’s insurgent past and “evolve tradition” motive are declared but never dramatized; we hear she offered a memory, yet the sacrifice is reported, not shown, so cost stays abstract. Interiority leans on lyrical labels—‘seed of evolution’, ‘quiet voice of seedlings’—rather than embodied contradiction. The telepathy enables plot but generates no visible flaw or trade-off; competence is unchallenged, blunting crucible pressure. Closure achieves Earned Stasis, yet the emotional price is off-stage, so the change feels inferred, not legible in gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is sensorily anchored and embodied; the “pearl of stillness” device gives her a usable, character-specific ritual. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene—grief never fights against her resolve—so the arc is smooth but not razor-sharged. The photograph touch supplies a micro-choice that tilts stance, earning the moderate change. Voice stays coherent, but the absence of visible flaw or mistake keeps her just shy of live-wire complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The interior contradiction—artist who paints souls yet can’t see his own—is dramatized in every beat: trembling fingers on spines, spiral walk, final whisper. Embodied motion (cards slipping like loose threads) externalizes crestfallen state without diagnostic label. Micro-choice to descend stairwell crystallizes value hierarchy: art > daylight. Cost is visible—sealed door, salt-stink, solitary glow—so renunciation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s “serene anger” is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice that costs him; the interiority stays at label level (“his voice trembled with a calm fury”). The only visible decision—declaring the world will listen—arrives without prior causality or new risk, so the renunciation feels un-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren’s interior motive—free the archives from silence—remains clear, but her contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The moment she drops the letter into the column, we glimpse the cost (“risked her own frozen preservation”) yet the beat is narrated, not enacted; we don’t see her hand hesitate or feel the coil’s bite. Emotional embodiment stays writerly (“bravely conflicted burned brighter”) and the final stance is reported, not endured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s pacifist resolve is embodied early (“she chose to sheathe it”) and repeatedly tested in concrete micro-choices (handing the petal, gathering scraps). The interior contradiction between inherited violence-aptitude and chosen gentleness stays live; the final rose-offering to the boy crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is muscle-level (“calm fire ignite within”). One hairline slip: “senselessly perceptive” is used as authorial label twice before it constrains action; still, the trait immediately guides her noticing the canvas prayer, earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority remains poetic but abstract; the fisher’s “cool-headed” trait is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices. No visible cost or relational crucible on-page; the final acceptance reads as tranquil epiphany rather than earned renunciation. Emotion is stated (“longing,” “yearning”) without bodily contradiction or stakes scaled to 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mira’s desire to uncover truth is declared early and re-iterated, yet her interiority stays generic (“feeling its weight like a secret waiting to be inked”) and never contradicts itself; the rosewood nib is fondled but never forces a hard trade-off, so the promised heir’s legacy never complicates her choices. The closing hand-off to the journalist is the first moment of visible cost, but it is sprung late and feels like a gracious gesture rather than a compelled loss. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; therefore endurance is not “earned,” merely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s guilt-driven quest is palpable; her interiority stays anchored in amber, recorder, and letters, never drifting into label-speak. Micro-choices—needle stitching amber to chassis, slipping her own letter beneath the drawer—manifest contradictory tenderness and self-exile. Cost is legible: she forfeits the possibility of forgetting, accepting perpetual custodianship of sorrow. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets idle; tattooist identity surfaces through star-map diction and nocturnal labor, not just label.

    Liora’s curiosity-driven motive is clear and embodied through chalk-touching and sand-tracing; the shift from lilac unease to calm is legible. Yet her interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“unlearning was not erasing knowledge…”) that tells us the insight rather than dramatizing it, muting contradictory impulse. The final stance crystallizes but the cost feels symbolic rather than personal—no visible forfeiture or relationship stakes raise the price.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “gentle radical” label never becomes a lived paradox, so contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized. Micro-choices—kneeling, whispering “Hearthsteel”—are present but feel pre-orded by poetic fiat, not by a visible internal struggle. Retrocognitive entrapment is named repeatedly yet never limits or distorts a present tactic; it functions as mood, not flaw. Still, the voice sustains a believable ideological sensibility and the final stance crystallizes with a palpable, if abstract, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ghost’s yearning is palpable, yet his interiority stays abstract—colors hum but the ache stays lyrically generic. His single decisive act—singing under the orchard—earns the closure bridge, but we are told, not shown, how the echo-method alters his essence. No contradictory impulse complicates the ascent; he glides from despair to transcendence without micro-choices that cost him anything on the page. The shopkeeper enters as a vessel, not a crucible, so status/relationship pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s affectionate skepticism is embodied early: “convinced that hidden geometry could translate human intention into color” while still “humming a quiet tune.” Internal contradiction surfaces only once (static shock memory), then yields to smooth competence; no visible misstep compounds. Final “surge of purpose” is foreshadowed, but the cost is vicarious (future scientists) rather than personal, so the renunciation feels gentle, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “voice of the unknown” motive is reiterated rather than tested under pressure, so the final crystallization feels foretold, not earned through visible contradiction or micro-choice. No embodied emotion contradicts the serene competence—she never doubts, missteps, or pays a price that changes her stance. The arc is a smooth accumulation, not a crucible; competent serenity dominates, so the closure lacks the bite of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is poetic but abstract; her contradictions are declared (“quietly inspired”) rather than embodied in gesture. The micro-choice to pour sand into the jar is present, yet the cost—risk of losing the echo or herself—is only implied, not felt. No genuine flaw complicates the turn; she succeeds without visible trade-off, so the arc leans inspirational rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    Agent’s guilt and need for redemption are clear, but interiority drifts into atmospheric paraphrase (“felt warmth surge…reminder that healing can start within”) that tells rather than embodies the shift; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene when he drinks or places the pillbox—choice feels pre-ordained, not tested. The single on-page decision—placing the pillbox on the altar—carries symbolic weight yet lacks an observable cost or risk that might fail, muting the before/after stakes for this length. Earned change is asserted rather than dramatized; still, the arc coheres through the object and setting, and the emotional direction is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority is lyrically consistent but stays at a meditative register; no contradictory impulses under pressure. The promise to “distill complexity” is declared, yet no micro-choice shows him weighing trade-offs or risking failure—he simply waits and receives the river’s answer. Cost is poetic rather than embodied: the needle cools against his chest, but this is observation, not consequence. Result: a gentle arc of mood, not character.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—stoic potter vs. aching listener—plays out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, shifting the lantern). Each beat sharpens her hierarchy of values: comprehension before rescue, patience before intervention. The final renunciation—leaving the lantern as beacon—pays the cost of perpetual guardianship, earned by every prior tactile discovery. No stock phrasing; her perceptual signature is clay-dust, salt-crack, lantern-warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically embodied (“protected vulnerability” pulses through every beat) and her micro-choices (kneeling on the ledge, clicking the latch, whispering covenant) enact a believable hierarchy of values. The arc is a credible renunciation: she pays with perpetual return and nightly exposure, cost made visible in the final “cool mist” and departing sigh. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is allowed to surface in-scene; she is too harmoniously single-minded, blunting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically voiced but remains at a single emotional register; contradictory impulses are declared (“brittle awakenings”) rather than dramatized in choice. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path—she walks, places, records, whispers, but the stakes never force a recognizably costly trade-off. The claimed contemporaneity with the sky-whale stays ornamental; it alters neither tactic nor self-risk. Closure is a felt uplift rather than an earned renunciation, so cost is ambient, not character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motive—“to find the thread that connects all things”—is stated early and re-activated at the climax when she seals the letters, giving her a visible renunciation. Interiority stays lyric rather than concrete; we get no contradictory impulse in scene, only ambient wonder. Emotion is performed (“soft veil,” “gentle sigh”) rather than embodied contradiction. The keeper-of-secrets role is label-deep; it never complicates her tactics or exposes a blind spot that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically present but abstract; her contradictory impulses are asserted rather than embodied in gesture or momentary perception. The “cautiously hopeful” trait is named repeatedly yet never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. No relationship crucible or secondary character pressure tests her stance; she remains the sole active will, flattening status dynamics. Closure is a soft Charged Poise rather than earned renunciation, so the motivational arc feels gently atmospheric rather than personally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The claustrophobic explorer’s contradictory impulses—adventurous drive vs. suffocation panic—are dramatized in every tactile beat; the compass micro-choices tighten under pressure. The final renunciation (sharing the song rather than hoarding power) is forecast by his embodied dread and the prudently adventurous tilt that keeps him alive. Cost is felt: the cavern’s sighing architecture literalizes his chest’s release. Voice stays singular, no status dynamics needed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s blindness and methodical nature are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through tactile choices that risk failure; the only concrete action—tracing names—could be done by anyone. Her “dormant empathy” is declared, not embodied in a beat where she might refuse or regret something tangible. The promised contradiction between method and tenderness stays theoretical, so the final awakening feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s “nervous confidence” is shown in trembling fingertips and the decision to descend the ladder, but the ancestor’s bravery is only asserted; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the final resolve feels announced rather than earned. Interiority slips into abstractions (“felt both brave and trembling”) instead of embodied contradiction under live pressure. The copper nail momentarily focuses her stance, yet the beat is narrated rather than acted, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fiddler’s interiority is lyric but diffuse; “luminous disbelief” is repeated instead of embodied contradiction. His decision to keep traveling is earned, yet the cost is declared (“weight of the moment”) rather than dramatized in muscle or breath. Micro-choices (lifting bow, placing glass) are present, but the emotional differential between external calm and internal fracture is not made legible in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Arlen’s polished calm is repeatedly embodied (steady lantern, twilight over arena) and drives his micro-choice to pin foreign bills as territorial markers; the final pocketing of the euro converts paternal legacy into quiet purpose with felt cost. Interior contradiction flickers only once—doubts whispered after funding—yet remains abstract; more embodied tension under pressure would lift the score. The renunciation of LoopForge’s loop-logic is earned, but the emotional price is implied rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—“the weight of the phrase settle in her chest”—and her micro-choice to speak the telegram aloud is embodied. Yet her motives plateau; once she decides to “read the sky,” no contradictory impulse or new risk complicates her. The story tells us she feels doubt lifted rather than dramatizing a visible cost for that shift. Interior texture is strong, but the arc lacks a late, costly renunciation to earn full believability.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong interiority—“a calm blade ready for battle,” “warlike serenity”—gives her a distinct emotional signature. The lost-finder trait is shown twice and drives the climax (amulet recovery). Yet her guardedness never cracks; the “heart finally open” moment is asserted, not dramatized, blunting the promised change.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the visionary’s contradictory impulses are described rather than dramatized; no micro-choice shows her curiosity colliding with fear. The final acceptance of covenant is foreshadowed but still reads as an inevitable epiphany rather than a costly decision. Label-free embodiment is mostly achieved, yet the emotional crescendo is slightly smoothed by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maelia’s interior contradiction—gentle yet reckless—surfaces only in summary; no embodied moment shows both traits colliding under pressure. The “storm of purpose” is label-speak; we never see her hesitate or suffer a visible trade-off while pressing soot into bone. Her final smile and exit feel earned because the amber thread visibly lightens her palm, but the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized. Interiority stays atmospheric rather than specific; we learn she “feels burdens lighten” but not how that ache lived in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ex-roadie interiority is textured through sound-stage memory and tactile object handling; the “applause” ghost rings with visible cost. Flaws surface only in the late, over-articulated ledger lesson that summarizes rather than dramatizes the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s shift from solitary preservation to shared enlightenment is internally coherent and embodied; the “kindly methodical” trait shows in tactile seed-handling and patient note-taking. The contradiction between haunted ambition and compassionate yield is alive in-scene, not abstract. The final decision to descend carries visible cost—she forfeits the arbor’s certainty—earning the closure turn. Minor: the “physics of transition” want remains slightly academic; a single sensory jolt of personal loss could have tipped it into 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The titan-gear librarian’s interiority is mostly poetic summary (“he understood,” “he sensed,” “he realized”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice shows gears literally slowing or speeding with moonlight. The final decision to open blank shelves is declared, not dramatized with visible cost—no risk of mechanical seizure, social ridicule, or loss of scroll-memory. Emotional states are labeled (“quiet gratitude,” “yearning”) instead of felt through bronze-cog tremors or salt-stung leather. Because the climax is summary, the migration of his own identity feels ornamental rather than a crucible that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s interiority is evocative—“each step echoing like a heartbeat paused at the edge of hesitation”—and her micro-choice to open the shell is visible. Yet her motives stay abstract: “dissolve the walls between hearts” is stated, not dramatized through contradiction or risk. No secondary character presses her, so the crucible is purely internal; the earned shift is gently felt but not paid for with a legible cost or flaw-driven mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is concrete—body off medication, coat patched with accordion tape—but the “truth-seeking river chronicler” tag is declarative, never tested; no contradictory impulse in scene. The final promise to the stones is earned, yet we never see him lie or conceal, so self-forgiveness lacks a prior on-page transgression to complicate the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s “cautious exuberance” is a vivid contradiction, carried through embodied micro-choices—clutching the watch, noting delays, inhaling the petal. The veiled dreamer’s pressure is present but filtered through the narrator’s gaze; her final whisper crystallizes the stake without forcing her interiority onto the page. The only missing torque is a moment where the narrator’s flaw risks actual loss; the garden offers petals freely, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personal. Still, the endurance/renunciation is legible—once spoken, the word can never be unspoken—so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and character-specific—her “mulberry ache” and tactile handling of the ice violin embody grief under pressure. The telepathic vine bond is accepted without diagnostic speak, and her final micro-choice to “propagate dissent” through music is a credible, earned stance. Missing: a visible contradiction that would make her decision cost feel sharper; the empire envoy’s mirrored ache arrives late, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin. Still, her flaws (archive-bound caution, solitary grief) directly shape the tactic, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; “lucidly watchful” is asserted, never tested by contradiction or sensory overload. No micro-choice after the brush-stroke climax—she simply “whispered a promise” without visible cost or altered stance. The beautician-mortician duality is never dramatized; only the mortician half appears. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—cool stone under palms, scent of fermented grapes—yet her contradictory impulses (forgive / stay vigilant) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene. The decisive moment—laying the hairpin to catch sunrise—carries visible cost, but the brother-betrayal backstory arrives in one 40 % reflective slab that flattens pressure. Still, her “kindly decisive” trait consistently shapes micro-choices (shielding rows, guiding workers), earning the closure renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s “conscience-for-hire” premise is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward poetic self-summary (“weight of others’ unresolved guilt”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final shrug is elegant yet feels lightly earned because prior beats rehearse the stance instead of testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira’s reversed-aging biology is vivid as a condition, but it never alters her micro-choices under pressure; the withheld revelation is a cerebral decision, not a beat where her body forces a trade-off. The stakes are emotional, not corporeal, so the curse stays ornamental. Interiority is poetic but lacks contradictory impulse during the actual grotto confrontation; the moment of “smiling” at the mirror feels grafted on, not earned by prior visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is richly embodied (“weathered resolve settle into her marrow”); her micro-choices—placing the arrowhead, inhaling the wave, bowing—trace a credible arc from passive listening to earned, motionless navigation. The renunciation of physical departure is foreshadowed and charged with cost (“the canyon’s history settle like dust on her shoulders”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Selric’s soft-glow failure and quiet-brilliance goal are consistent; the interiority is concrete (“his own doubts”) and embodied (“robes frayed like old drafts”). The final acceptance feels earned because the keystone trial directly reweights his self-perception. Still, the only micro-choice that costs him on-page is the symbolic unstrap; no secondary flaw complicates the ascent, so the arc is more luminous epiphany than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.1)
    Eli’s lantern-tending ritual gives him a tactile signature, but his “luminous vow” stays abstract; we never glimpse a private memory or contradiction that makes the color-of-sound obsession urgent. Once inside the library, he becomes a passive witness: books open themselves, colors spill, ribbon wraps—no micro-choice risks failure or cost. The beat where he pockets the sigil is summary, not stance; the closing promise feels like restart, not earned stasis. Interiority is atmospheric, not crucible; we’re told he’s “steadied,” never shown him wrestle doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; Silas’s quietly enthusiastic obsession pulses through tactile coin rituals and violet-mist stares. Contradictory impulses—reverence vs. rebellion against darkness—co-exist in-scene, driving the final turn. The earned renunciation (accepting purpose as frequency, not destination) carries visible cost in the cracked amber wall. Slight over-articulation of “wavelength align with purpose” nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—grief versus the need to name—drives every beat; the micro-choice to speak “Astraeon” crystallizes motive into irrevocable action with visible cost (weight lifts, halo forms). Memory of the sailor surfaces as earned payoff, not epiphany. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “lukewarm” temperament is dramatized through micro-choices—he hums, warms metal only enough, trusts mist-drops as metronome—so competence and limitation coexist. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; his naivety is embodied in the act of counting droplets with a reed. The devotion’s brittleness surfaces when the cracked bell threatens to stay mute, forcing a visible wager of faith. Closure earns its change: the bell rings, fish return, and the mage’s pulse syncs with the cosmos—cost felt in the sunrise melt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Caitlyn’s vigilance is embodied in the quiet gait and the label pressed to her palm, but her interior contradiction—duty versus communal memory—stays summary-level; the “precisely humane” trait alters no visible micro-choice under pressure. Closure is credible yet the cost is communal, not personal, so her private stake feels slightly unscathed.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.7)
    Selene’s secret sentimentality is shown through her tactile handling of the crystal and the childhood firefly memory that surges at the payoff, giving her a credible interior contradiction. The motivations (harmonize logic/intuition, reach wonder) stay consistent and escalate to the final shard-kiss, but the prose occasionally tells her yearning in abstract labels (“coveted,” “sought the touch of wonder”) rather than dramatizing new micro-choices under each rising beat. Still, she tracks as an individual, her alchemist precision visible in how she arrays shards in a spiral mimicking starlings, and the ending renunciation—accepting awe over pure reason—carries visible emotional cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the seeker’s grief-guilt around the buckle is visceral. Yet the contradictory impulse (stay vs descend) is summarized rather than enacted in-scene, softening the final choice. Micro-choices (knot sequence, harness test) are vivid but isolated; no secondary character pressure tests his values live. Still, the arc of bearing responsibility lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s numbness and paradox-blade are vivid, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“defeat emotional numbness,” “complementary opposites”) that tells rather than embodies. The micro-choice to cut the jar lands, yet the prior beats feel pre-decided, muting contradictory impulse. Earned cost is present—the cracked glass and shared pulse—but the arc’s emotional risk is cushioned by abstract diction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—no contradictory impulses in scene, only lyrical resolve. The “quiet triumph” is declared, not embodied; we see no micro-choice that costs her anything. Her motivation stays flat; innovation desire is asserted, never tested against risk or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conductor’s “mournfully eager” interiority is palpably embodied—trembling palm, wet eyes, sync with hidden heartbeats—yet his contradictory drive (grief vs. healing) stays active in scene. The single micro-choice chain—pull cord → vortex → ash → laughter—earns the closure. No second character, so status/relationship bullets are waived. Still, the flaw is minor: the epiphany risks a hair of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he realized the power…”) but pays it immediately with the next pull.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian’s shift from solitary predator to curator-of-uncertainty is dramatized through embodied beats—breathing frost into memory, feeling amber warm sinews—rather than diagnostic labels; contradictory impulses wait/claim are held in scene. Cost is visible: the feral body accepts domestication of purpose in the final image, pendant fused to chest. Interiority stays concrete (“rusted syllables,” “lattice of interiorized exteriors”), never therapy-speak. No orientation or lens penalties apply; the earned stasis of endless guardianship is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hopeless alchemist’s interiority is vividly embodied (ember-light reflected in eyes, heartbeats echoing the crozier’s pulse) and his contradictory impulses—resignation vs fragile curiosity—drive every micro-choice. The “creative destruction” belief is dramatized through tactile grinding of ash, brushing elixir, waiting for the penny-drop heartbeat; we feel the cost in each failed spark. His stoic sensitivity shows in how he registers each ember-sigh as if it were a promise, yet the story never abstracts this into therapeutic self-diagnosis. The final smile of “stoic wonder” is earned because every prior beat has welded his flaw (hopelessness) to his method (patient refinement) and the visible price is the cold flame he must now tend alone.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Selin’s motives (map-making survival via starlight) stay consistent and anchor every micro-choice; the interior contradiction—scientist vs. believer in wonder—is dramatized in her whispered intention, not declared. Embodied emotion is sparse but precise (“serenely electric glow” calming her breath). The climactic act of lowering the shard back carries visible renunciation cost: she forfeits possession to seed tomorrow’s signal, an earned stasis under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio’s “resiliently positive grin” is declared, not dramatized; the interior contradiction between duty and timeline-merging obsession is only asserted. The moment he whispers to the hourglass is the single visible micro-choice that charges the climax, but it arrives after pages of lyrical paraphrase rather than embodied tension. Cost is abstract (“the weight of nothing”) rather than felt; we never see him risk or lose anything corporeal. Still, his stance crystallizes into an Earned Stasis that forecloses further ferry vanishings, giving the arc credible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The architect’s interiority is vivid—his unsettling calm, the contradiction between scientific control and hallucinatory perception, and the embodied tension in his fingertips as the thread pulses. His micro-choices (each knot, each step onto the bridge) visibly re-price his goal and foreclose retreat. No contradictory label-speak; the “rational enchantment” is lived, not named. Cost is legible: the thread coils into his skin, a permanent filament of shared memory he now carries out of the gallery.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s balanced curiosity is named repeatedly but never dramatized through a visible trade-off; she observes, instructs, and whispers promises without an on-page moment where curiosity collides with caution and costs her something concrete. The interiority stays atmospheric (“felt the pull of the anchor link echoing in her chest”) rather than contradictory under pressure, so the trait never sharpens into a decision that could fail. Anchor-link-as-lesson is elegant but Mira herself remains static; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values that might complicate her serene competence. The ending’s somber marvel is collectively owned, so her personal stake stays flat and the closure is voiced, not earned through embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.7)
    Curiosity is named, not embodied; no contradictory impulse under pressure. The promise to guard echoes carries mild cost but is declared, not dramatized. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“weight of incidental heroism”) rather than specific sensation. Voice remains consistent, yet emotional calibration feels smoothed rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is named but never embodied in the moment; she slides through rusted doors and phase folds without a constricted breath or panic beat. The interior contradiction we need—fear of tight space vs pull of codex—stays abstract, so her final “heart at ease” feels asserted rather than earned. Micro-choices (aligning codex, whispering return) are goal-efficient but don’t reveal a hierarchy of values under visible cost. Still, her occupation-derived attentiveness to invisible passages gives the arc a credible spine.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the pane, the warmth of the shard—but the “death-certificate error survivor” label is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her fight bureaucracy, only absorb a summary. The porcelain shard’s vibration and final warmth give embodied micro-choices, yet the ghost’s confession feels handed to her rather than wrested through a visible flaw or mistake. Motive coherence slides: she moves from fixing records to cosmic wisdom without a beat that shows the shift cost her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s motive—transmute texture into sound before language dies—remains steady and is embodied in every beat (whispering to the diamond, tracing birds, sealing the tunnel). Interiority is lyrical yet concrete (“the copper veins in his skin tingled”), never drifting into label-speak. The only absence is a second on-page character, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; no deduction. The arc is Earned Stasis: he accepts the song will be locked in stone and bone, a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The researcher’s undercover motive is stated, not embodied; we witness no moment where the mask almost slips. Interiority floats in atmospheric summary (“I remembered my orders”) rather than conflicting impulses acted out under the garden’s pressure. The emotional turn—bitterness loosening into laughter—is announced, not dramatized through micro-choice; the arrowhead’s shattering is external spectacle rather than character-driven sacrifice. Cost is present but generic; the mission succeeds without visible personal price, keeping the arc tidy rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The violinist’s longing is vivid and embodied, but interiority repeats the same “yearn / beauty / rust” note without deepening contradiction; the final renunciation lands because the causal chain stays intact, yet we never feel a genuine competing impulse that would sharpen cost. Micro-choices (bow pressure, shell placement) serve the plot but read as ritual gestures rather than risky trade-offs, keeping him just shy of crucible heat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo’s “respectfully rebellious” gait and the storm-bottle as embodied emotion give him idiosyncratic texture; the final quiet renunciation of the empty bottle shows visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the single on-page choice—slipping the truce envelope—relies on a pre-loaded metaphor rather than a fresh micro-choice under pressure, muting the sense of flaw-driven mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her hands “moving like prayer,” her song “a low melody that rose from her throat like a gentle wind.” Contradictory impulses (silence vs. possibility, repair vs. surrender) coil inside every beat. The final stance—she keeps singing to keep the quiet alive—earns its cost: she descends alone into mirrored darkness, halo fragment as price. Micro-choices (fitting shard to eye, choosing the spiral stairs) consistently reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s calm stewardship is palpable, but her interior contradiction—longing to awaken stories while guarding patrons’ solitude—stays summary; no micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything when the memory-field peaks. The scarf’s hum matters more than any bodily cue from her; the ledger entry at the end is a label, not a cost felt in muscle or breath.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrical but remains consistent; her yearning is anchored to concrete ritual—palette, camera, dawn. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only stated, so the “hierarchy of values with visible cost” is implied rather than enacted. The bridge-moment with Lio is summarized, not pressured; we never see her relinquish or risk anything on-page. Still, the vocationally specific actions (odd-hour library, sunrise photography) individuate her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith’s interiority is lyrically sustained yet abstract; emotions are named rather than embodied (e.g., “impossible longing”). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—resolve is steady—so the arc leans symbolic, not crucible. The moment he eases the ribbon is decisive, but the cost feels cosmic rather than personal; stakes diffuse. Earned, but at a mythic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.7)
    The folklorist’s curiosity is asserted but never dramatized as contradiction or risk; she observes, kneels, whispers, but no micro-choice shows her weighing cost or facing failure. Interiority stays scenic (“she realized…”) rather than embodied under pressure. The earned return of memories feels gentle, not a stance that forecloses a path with visible cost—more gift than renunciation. Competence outweighs struggle; flaws stay off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s “mentor resilience quietly” motive is vivid and embodied—her backward walk, the combative tenderness—but the interior contradiction between retreat and guardianship is asserted more than dramatized in a single beat; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pruner’s reverence and creative hunger are vivid, but his interiority stays at lyrical distance; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the vow feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene. The traveler’s plea adds a second beat of agency, yet the pruner’s choice—handing over a sprig—costs him nothing we can feel. A single micro-choice under visible tension would have pushed this above 7.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation and grief-exhuming mission are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) that tells emotional state rather than embodying contradiction under pressure; the mask/net/needle triad externalizes stakes yet no micro-choice after the first knot visibly risks or costs her anything, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The map framer’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—aligning projector, tracing glyphs—rather than label-speak, giving her a perceptual signature. Interiority stays concrete (“feeling the ragged paper like a wound”) and contradictory impulses (awe vs fear) coexist in-scene. The final renunciation—accepting the tear as portal—carries visible cost in the “soft glow” that leaves her recording alone, an earned stasis. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps social-status crucible and relationship pressure off the table, capping depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mort’s quietly analytic nature is nicely embodied in the filament-untangling and wax-sealed note, but the interiority drifts into thematic commentary (“physics of letting go”) that feels more authorial than character-bound. The “tension minus attachment equals release” equation is overtly diagnostic, blunting the embodied contradiction we need for 9-band. Still, his micro-choices (turning the globe, sealing the cylinder) track a credible arc of quiet renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the earned-stasis closure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The balladeer’s solitary, need-driven arc is clear: every press of the flower plate is a micro-choice that escalates his wager with the ghost. Interiority stays concrete (“He felt the tug of recognition”) rather than abstract, and the final encoding costs him his last fresh blossom—an earned, visible price. The flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; he moves from diligent to more diligent without visible inner split, capping him just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The servant’s “affectionate detachment” is shown rather than named—his gentle micro-choices (lifting the goggles, sealing the diary, whispering the promise) embody it. Motivation remains steady: seek joy beneath anguish. No internal contradiction or flaw complicates him, so the arc is flat, but the stance is credibly maintained. Cost is present yet soft: he carries the jars’ warmth upward, a felt but not forceful price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s interiority is vivid—cloud-emotion ledger, brass inscriptions, telescope-weight—but her choices stay observational; no micro-choice alters the scene’s physics or her stake. Motive (“prove emptiness remembers”) is declared, not pressure-tested; no contradiction or forfeiture visible on the page. Earned stasis is implied; cost is lyrical, not embodied in a beat she triggers.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s face-blindness is never exploited as gimmick; instead it quietly underwrites every pigment choice and the final renunciation of sighted verification. The micro-choices—counting drying intervals by coin-notches, pressing the eroded星座 into wet lapis—show a hierarchy of values where tactile precision outranks visual proof. Interiority stays concrete (“fractally precise hand that seemed to echo the coin’s tiny grooves”) and avoids diagnostic language. Closure cost is felt: she smiles while the sky she cannot see collapses into dust, proving the stance was earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lira’s curiosity is shown through embodied micro-choices—tracing chalk, whispering foreign words—that escalate to the luminous payoff; the “diligently curious” trait is dramatized, not labelled. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial, though the emotional contradiction layer is thin: we see no moment where curiosity threatens the ship or her standing, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Motivation is consistent and character-bound, but the final pride is slightly performative because the stakes never imperil her. Still, she is an individual, not a trope, and her voice-of-attention is specific enough for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    The locksmith’s quiet hunger to “learn the rhythm of repair” anchors every beat; his trembling fingers, breath “heavy as fog,” and final act of cradling the ticking clock embody a believable, stoic vocation. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The only minor drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“keeper of keys and quiet hopes”) that edges toward therapy-speak; still, the renunciation cost—carrying the weight of broken time—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s translucent benevolence is consistent yet too frictionless; she seeds events but suffers no visible risk or limitation, blunting cost. Villagers’ turn from “strangers” to “family” is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Still, her quiet sidewalk whispers and the children’s mirrored trust give a ghost-specific interiority that lifts the score above the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically particular—“breath a thin thread of frost,” “bruised awe”—and her micro-choice to place the puppet head on the dial is embodied and irreversible. The broken puppet’s grin widening under pressure gives the object a reactive pulse, turning prop into co-agent. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; the decision path is quasi-mythic rather than psychologically fraught, keeping her below the 9-band. Still, the endurance cost is visible: she leaves “cracks mending,” a quiet renunciation that forecloses return to ordinary time.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The caretaker’s interiority is concrete—his bargain-born duty and ash-tongued bitterness are shown through gesture (empty hands, reed-tracing). Yet the “graceless beauty” refrain drifts toward diagnostic shorthand; a deeper contradictory impulse in-scene would raise the final renunciation to 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is rich—her synesthetic hearing of wind-as-symphony and her tactile reading of foam feel idiosyncratic and embodied. The contradiction between lab control and river surrender is alive in her kneeling, weaving, laughing. Grief’s “loosening” is shown via the laugh that scatters foam into her hair, a perfect micro-cost. Only slight over-articulation (“translate separation into connection”) keeps her from the 8.8+ zone.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vendor’s interiority is lyrically vivid (“eyes reflecting a pattern of broken sentences”) but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, only serene certainty. The child enters too late to test or alter him, so the claimed fulfillment feels unearned. Interior voice is lovely yet externally static; we witness no micro-choice that costs him anything. Motive is declared, not pressure-tested, so the arc lands as mood rather than change.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lir is given a single, mystical competence—tasting memories—that never collides with a contradictory impulse; his interiority is poetic but not individuated (no micro-choice tests the gift). The “sandpaper rough memories” motive is announced, not dramatized through conflicting wants, so the climax feels pre-ordained rather than earned under rising pressure. Because no secondary character shares the scene, relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A. Still, the embodied sensory hook of “bitter as burnt cumin, bright citrus of redemption” keeps the portrait from abstractions and earns mid-to-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian’s interiority is lyrical but consistent—her humming, the etching of verses on planks, the gesture of returning the weight all crystallize her empathetic-decisive trait with visible cost (she gives the city her night's labor and her own lullaby). Contradictory impulses (desire to heal vs. fear the silos will refuse) are implied rather than dramatized in-scene, so the psychological tension is poetic rather than raw. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the "crucible" test is moot. Closure is earned: her body aches, the weight is returned, the city breathes as one—cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aria’s “chaotically precise” interiority is vivid—her whispered equations vibrate the air—but the promised internal contradiction never detonates; she powers through every beat without visible mis-wiring. The archeologist motive is asserted, not dramatized; the only micro-choice is to keep pressing on, so the arc is linear rather than helical. The mirror-palm pulse supplies embodied emotion, yet the cost (stone could fracture) is floated, never levied on her. Earned Stasis is gestured at but not paid, so the closure lands as hopeful posture, not irreversible foreclosing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her tattoos flickering in response to the grotto’s call is a sharp micro-choice—but her motives stay abstract (“to bind forgotten combinations” never collides with a lived fear or desire). The latent blaze never mutates under pressure; it only intensifies, so the climactic alignment feels inevitable rather than costly. She does not misstep or relinquish anything; the library gains lamps, she gains certainty—no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Auris’s “fierce need to create music” is declared but never complicated or contradicted; interiority stays safely lyrical (“his heart”) rather than conflicted. He makes no hard choice—only keeps strum-coding cracks—so closure feels observed, not earned. Hedgehog & owls add charm yet zero pressure. Porcelain’s resilience could have forced a risk-of-break decision that revealed flaw or cost; instead it remains invulnerable, keeping stakes emotional-tranquil.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured—stone warmth, sky-mapping, “hopeful melancholy” layering—but contradictions stay abstract; no micro-choice visibly costs him anything until the final rook placement, which is still more symbol than stakes. Motive remains steady rather than intensifying; exile is background, not crucible. Earned, but only just.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pacifist’s motive—catalog silence to seed empathy—remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The diary opening is a passive triumph, not a costly decision; interiority drifts into performed sincerity (“theatrical sincerity” is named, not dramatized). No relationship crucible or status shift on stage; stakes stay conceptual. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically specific—her nose “detecting the faintest perfume of moss and moonlight”—and her ambition is anchored in daily micro-choices (planting, whispering, doodling). Yet the emotional stakes stay abstract: no contradiction or visible cost disturbs her serene progression; the bloom simply rewards patience. The corpse-flower’s lesson is declared, not dramatized through a wrenching decision, so the “earned stasis” feels more reported than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s quiet, tactile micro-choices—skimming the canopy, lowering the obsidian probe, finally releasing the tip—track a credible arc from curiosity to custodial responsibility. Interiority stays concrete and bias-filtered (“the planet’s own heartbeat,” “quiet balloons”). The renunciation at the end costs her sole ownership of the secret, a visible forfeiture that earns the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her breath as “measured note,” the anemometer’s needle “trembling like a nervous heart”—but the micro-choices never truly fork: she surveys, records, predicts, and the vortex obeys. No contradiction or cost is dramatized; the only potential loss (the town’s silence) is external and never personalized. The flight-patch talisman is handled twice yet never alters her tactics or betrays a blind spot; it remains emblematic rather than crucible. Result: a competent, poetic observer who never risks failure or belief.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell-ringer’s synesthetic gift is vividly embodied—she “hears colors as notes”—and her decision to re-seal the amber sheet inside the cave is a micro-choice that costs her the warmth she briefly carried. Yet the motive “to certify wonder as essential” is stated more often than dramatized, and no contradictory impulse ever threatens that resolve; the interior arc is a single steady ascent rather than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is rich—her “avalanchingly quiet” breath embodies the canyon hush inside her—and every micro-choice (uncasing relics, planting driftwood, turning the flute) is filtered through her vocation and flaw: clinging to a single world. The ending renunciation—silence as offering—pays off her earlier fear of unfinished cycles, so the change is earned and costly. Minor slip: “harvest insights from failure” drifts toward thesis-speak; still, the embodied metaphors keep it from abstract label.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. the flood of borrowed grief—surfaces only in summary; the moment she “felt her own pulse align” is told, not embodied. No micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything; the fragment simply answers her. The coat-pocket promise is a future cost, not one paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courier’s shaky curiosity and mentor-haunted interiority are vivid; his micro-choice to hand the pendant to the girl crystallizes values. Flaws: no interior contradiction under pressure, and the “extend encounters” power works too smoothly—no visible cost or risk to him, so the arc feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority glows: the “restless curiosity” against “ancient rituals” is shown, not told, and her micro-choice to align prism with frost is a value-revealing act. The embodied grief pulse and engine-sputter provide external confirmation of internal shift. Only the “vow to share” feels slightly abstract; a concrete next risk would clinch full cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrical but general—“latent sacrifice settle in her bones” tells rather than embodies. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the quiet acceptance is declared, not dramatized. The final renunciation is credible because the story’s lyric spell prepares us, yet the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.1)
    The blacksmith’s interior contradiction—meek yet quietly relentless—stays on the page through embodied hammer-strokes and the trembling palm on stone. The bartered memory is a concrete micro-choice, its scar felt in the hush before the tunnel opens. Yet the “quietly determined” refrain drifts toward label-speak in the final paragraph, muting the cost he just paid. More idiosyncratic speech or a glitch in his smith-step under spectators’ eyes would have sealed the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is sensorially rich and profession-specific; her micro-choices (spreading maps, whispering commands, raising the shard) are concrete and consequential. The final renunciation—shattering the shard to awaken the crew—pays the emotional cost promised by her quest for truth. Flaw: the “weight of withheld truth” is stated more than it is felt in her body; still, embodied cues (maps pulsing like bridges) keep the score in high band.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marek’s reticence is shown through silent ritual, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible choice that costs him something; the vow to “protect” is declared, not dramatized. Emotion stays atmospheric rather than embodied—no bodily toll, no micro-choice that forecloses an alternative. The final beat is mood, not change.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s centuries-old fatigue is asserted, not embodied; her single micro-choice—raising the lantern—arrives only at the end and feels pre-scripted by prophecy rather than driven by visible internal contradiction. The storm herald’s laughter is texture without want or fear; neither character reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is declared (“world’s end”) but not felt on their bodies or tactics. Interiority leans on stock phrases—“weight of centuries,” “heartbeat against the night”—that flatten individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s watchful dye-master identity and donor-heart strangeness give her a distinct perceptual filter; her micro-choice to follow the wing’s sun-trail reweights the ending. Interiority is concrete (“eyes, sharp as the edge of a cut glass”) yet stays within lyric register. Motivation to “magnetize stories” is declared early and finally re-codified at the loom, so the through-line is legible. Flaw: no contradictory impulse under pressure—she glides from revelation to promise without testing or risking anything on-page, so the cost is conceptual, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s quiet, caretaker-observer persona is consistent; his tactile handling of the sextant and the grid shows embodied emotion. Interiority stays concrete—he “feels the sorrow in his chest ease” rather than labeling it. The final smile is a credible micro-renunciation: he accepts the modest scale of his power. No contradiction or therapy-speak; the only limit is that the trees’ witness remains an untested longing rather than a choice that costs him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s “patchwork of distant lives” is evocative but never crystallizes into a specific, contradiction-ridden impulse that drives a visible choice; her final whispered verse is a gentle promise rather than a renunciation or costly stance. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values with on-page cost, so the arc feels like a steady diffusion rather than a crucible. The memory-keeper premise remains intriguing, yet the interiority stays at souvenir-level rather than exposing a dramatic blind spot that compounds.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The recluse’s guilt over abandoning a friend is stated, not dramatized; we never see the friend or the act, so the emotional engine is abstract. Interiority drifts into gentle aphorism (“enlarged tranquility settled like fog”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final self-forgiveness is tender but feels prefabricated because the mistake itself is off-stage. Still, the consistent solitude and bookish ritual create a believable skin for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    The “creeping normality noticer” is sketched through evocative, idiosyncratic perception—reading weeds as confessions, slicing bread as whispered ritual—but interior contradiction and embodied emotion stay lyrical rather than acute; no visible cost or irreversible choice charges the ending, so the arc feels contemplative, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    The chief’s “gently meticulous” trait is dramatized through the calibrated ritual of frequency-sampling and ledger-tracing, grounding her interiority in tactile choices. A contradictory impulse—her need for private meaning versus archival duty—surfaces only late, softening the cost of her final vow. The childhood backstory is floated but not activated as a micro-choice, so the internal conflict never compounds. Still, her embodied patience and the visible shoulder-weight of vows keep characterization above the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lila’s interiority—“the comforting unease that settled like a soft blanket”—is simultaneously embodied and contradictory, showing her practiced fatalism under pressure. Her micro-choice to hurl the lanterns into darkness crystallizes a hierarchy of values: ancestral loyalty over personal safety. The antique fob’s tactile coldness externalizes time’s distortion and anchors her obstinate refusal to let history dictate her move. Cost is legible: the truce survives only until sunrise, leaving her path foreclosed by perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Arin’s luminous skepticism is evoked more through poetic epithets than embodied contradiction; the “dying-star” skin and compass-licking ritual are vivid, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The micro-choice to taste the ring is repeated rather than escalated, so the final “realization” reads as summary, not earned renunciation. Cost is atmospheric, not personal—no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s “charcoal-fingered” signature is visible in every beat; she acts under contradictory drives—curiosity vs. fear of silence—embodied in trembling hands and the decision to paint the lock. The memory gift is dramatized when forgotten songs become literal keys, tightening the stakes. The final filament stroke is a micro-choice that costs her the safety of detachment, earning the auroral release. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak, no stock epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The calligrapher’s refusal to write the loyalty proclamation and her subsequent decision to piece together the map are both concrete, motivated choices that visibly cost her (the plate’s graying, the risky descent). Interiority stays sensuous—“ink shimmered like sunrise on metal”—rather than diagnostic. A second beat of internally contradictory emotion would have lifted this into the 9-band; the moment she uncorks the first bottle is affectively flat, not layered with fear or guilt. Still, her through-line of “candor in small moments” drives every tactical move, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tuner’s desire to “preserve the color of wonder” is stated repeatedly, but no concrete contradiction or higher-stakes choice is forced under pressure; interiority stays lyrical rather than embodied. Micro-choices (tightening joints, stepping back) are present yet catalogued in summary cadences instead of scene, so cost is asserted not felt. No relationship crucible or secondary character pressure tests resolve; the arc is a steady-state vigil rather than earned renunciation. Still, the single-minded vocation and sensory ritual keep him credibly odd and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vira’s loneliness and yearning are embodied in her titanium skin “glinting like sunrise on sand” and in the micro-choice to tuck the breathing box beneath a rose vine—an action that costs her the last object of her past. The nostalgic-android contradiction is kept alive in every beat, never dissolved into tidy acceptance. The final “fleeting glitch” smile is earned because the static is shown dissolving through a chain of sensorial, not explanatory, moments. She never verbalizes an epiphany; the cost is the quiet renunciation of perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s curator-eye, her quiet cataloguing of letters, the gentle way she hands the locket to the boy—all feel specific to a woman who believes listening can mend. Interiority stays tactile (“the metal’s cool memory press against her palm”) rather than diagnostic, and her micro-choice to build the listening-bench alters the neighborhood’s circuit of grief. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the arc is a smooth accumulation rather than a crucible, but motive stays legible and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is poetic but stays anchored to the braid-touching and dice-handling micro-gestures; the contradiction between encoded self-protection and the need to release memory into the crystal is embodied in the final “whispered shift.” No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Cost is present—the lab collapses and she abandons her sanctuary—but the emotional price is stated lyrically rather than felt in body. Voice is consistent; braid and dice serve as perceptual extensions of her fingers, keeping her sensory signature sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority—“the tug in her bones,” lantern flame fed by reclaimed memories—grounds her obsession in sensory body-knowledge; the final smile is credible renunciation. Yet her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; we are told she is haunted, not shown a moment where she almost flees the chamber. The micro-choice to exhume is present but solitary; a second waver or risk would have pushed this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The summoner’s motivation is legible—prevent a coded prophecy—but her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“tranquil blaze of purpose”) rather than embodied contradiction. She acts once (places the wing) and endures, yet the cost feels atmospheric, not personal; we see no mistake, flaw, or irreversible loss that stains her. The crane wing, not her psyche, drives the ritual; the character serves the concept more than the concept reveals her.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is sensuous (“fingertips brushing the rusted iron rail”), but the narrator’s emotional engine stays abstract—“I had come to interrogate her about the seal’s origin” tells desire rather than showing contradiction. Liora’s patiently-nimble grace is embodied once; her deadness never complicates physiology or memory, so the promised contradiction is muted. The final choice—to listen to a window latch as word—is a credible micro-renunciation, yet the cost feels light because the building’s “heartbeat” is asserted, not dramatized through failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. believer in her own resonance archive—is declared repeatedly but never dramatized in a choice that costs her anything. The “charmed skeptic” label floats untested; no moment forces her to wager belief against proof. Embodied emotion is lush but generic (“ghostly resolve settles within her”) rather than specific to her body or risk. Micro-choices are absent; the seashell is lifted, ledger filled, but these actions neither narrow nor foreclose options, so the arc feels observational, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s interiority is lush—ink, thorn, and key refracted through memory—but her contradictory impulses stay in summary, never collide in a single beat under pressure; the “armor against doubt” is declared, not dramatized. The renunciation at the end is serene but causally lightweight; we are told the weight lifts, we do not feel a path foreclosed. Micro-choices are named (“traced,” “whispered”) rather than enacted with visible cost. Voice stays singular, yet emotional progression feels smoothed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lush and bias-rich (“reed-blown melancholy” POV filter), but the only micro-choice that costs her anything is the final merge of shells; prior beats are observational. The arc lands, yet the emotional price is more ambient than embodied—she walks away lighter, not scarred.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The whisperer’s interiority is lyrically specific—ice filaments, dream-tide, borrowed starlight in her veins—yet her contradictory impulse (to expose purity without force) is declared, not dramatized in a single visible micro-choice. The final palm-to-globe beat is emotionally embodied, but the cost (cold melt as promise) remains metaphorical rather than tactical. No secondary character applies pressure, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is waived. She earns a credible renunciation, but the absence of an on-page flaw-driven mistake keeps the arc just shy of 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interior contradiction flickers—philosopher/net-mender, action/reflection—but stays summary-level; no micro-choice under live pressure until the final whisk-set-down, which is too late to foreclose a path with felt cost. The “mend a torn strand of his own memory” pledge is announced, not dramatized; we watch him trace grooves, not decide, risk, or lose. Emotions are atmospheric rather than embodied; the heartbeat in the last paragraph is the first bodily signal we get. Still, the solitary ritual and occupational lens give him a distinct, if static, silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s investigative drive is concrete—her “notebook clenched tight,” the bodily act of sorting paper by scent, the micro-choice to inhale while placing the diamond—each beat externalizes her obsession and earns the final stoic renunciation. Interior contradiction is light; she never doubts her mission, so the arc is more discovery than crucible, keeping her just shy of full ambivalence. The “stillpoint as mental state” epiphany is dramatized through perceptual shift rather than lecture, satisfying the earned-insight test. No secondary character pressure on-page, hence relationship bullets N/A; solo performance still compels.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The visionary’s longing is vivid, but he never makes a visible choice that costs him anything; the allegiance is “rallied” off-page. Interiority is lyrically dense yet circular, restating the same ache in mirrored phrasing without deepening contradiction. Because the final smile is unearned by a prior decisive act, the arc feels observed, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s wistful, compensatory gaze is credibly embodied (“his ragged coat billowing like a sigh”) and his micro-choice to lift the music box seeds the central method. Redemption is pursued, not declared, and the final hand-off to the child shows visible cost—the relinquishing of sole guardianship of memory. Interiority stays concrete, but occasional abstraction (“the weight of centuries lift”) nudges him toward type. Still, contradictory impulses (wanderer vs. caretaker) remain live and shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “logically emotional” trait is announced early and surfaces in the copper-drum adjustment, but the interior contradiction is told rather than embodied; we get labels (“wrestled with the paradox”) instead of moment-by-moment friction. The final tear is earned, yet the arc is more competent than perilous—no visible mistake compounds—so the cost feels moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's interiority stays concrete—her “restrained wildness” is shown through quiet footfalls and the brass-compass gesture. The micro-choice to align the needle with the viaduct’s pulse crystallizes her stake and costs her prior restlessness. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict is more asserted than embodied, holding this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her boots echo, the lantern’s glow feels personal, and the valve turn is a tactile renunciation. Yet the “fortified vulnerability” is named more than embodied; the final beat leans on abstract summary (“acknowledging that my watchfully calm demeanor had been forged…”) rather than a contradictory impulse acted in-scene. Backstory about the mentor is anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR. The choice lands with cost, but the emotional contradiction could be sharper mid-breath.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The chaplain’s interiority is textured—his apology to unseen makers, the metronome of his steps—yet the “moral weight” and “quiet triumph” border on diagnostic label-speak, softening the embodied cost. His kneeling, rod-insertion, and the shared hand-clasp are micro-choices that credibly earn the heart’s first beat, but the shopkeeper remains a gentle cipher whose status pressure could have sharpened the crucible. The forgiveness-versus-mechanics tension is lived-in, but the final emotional modulation is slightly over-articulated, not underfelt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s “yearning algorithm” interiority is vivid, but the story never lets her doubt or risk anything; the bell-ringing succeeds exactly as planned, so no consequential choice or visible cost is paid. The glider is described more than steered—no beat where her curiosity collides with fear, fatigue, or irreversible loss. Result: a spirited sprite, not a pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lia’s “bright attentiveness” is shown through concrete metadata tracing and the deliberate lie she fabricates, not merely asserted. Her internal contradiction—curiosity versus complicity in viral deception—surfaces in the decision to repost the meme, a micro-choice that visibly costs her innocence. The final vow to “guard the hidden corridors” crystallizes an earned stance with moral freight. Interiority stays specific to a data-archivist’s sensorium (amber server glow, flickering checksums), avoiding stock emotion labels.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive nature is shown through micro-choices—placing the shard, whispering intention—yet the interior contradiction between duty and doubt never surfaces in scene. Emotions stay atmospheric (“felt the weight of unspoken hopes”) rather than embodied and specific under pressure. The final crystallization reads as serene acceptance rather than a costly renunciation; no path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet volunteering for salvage—are stated lyrically rather than dramatized in scene; the “fold in patience” realization is abstractly narrated instead of shown through a pressured micro-choice. Interiority drifts into diagnostic summary (“I finally understood…”) that tells us the emotional shift without embodied cost on the page. The lace tip functions as lyrical totem but never physically constrains a live decision; the grip-loosening metaphor is asserted, not demonstrated in an action with stakes. Earned stasis is hinted but not crystallized in a visible forfeiture or irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentinel’s solitary ritual is vivid and embodied; the charred edge as “silent confession” shows interiority without label-speak. Motive—bridge fire/earth—stays consistent, but micro-choices under pressure are implied rather than dramatized; no beat forces him to test or revise that motive. Endurance is earned, yet the lack of an opposing force keeps the change incremental rather than costly. Still, the quiet refusal to leave reads as credible renunciation with felt solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Keeper’s “strangely honest” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; he never faces a test where candor costs him anything. Interiority drifts into lyric omniscience (“he felt the echo of wisdom settle like dew”) that transcends his limited POV. Because no contradictory impulse or visible cost is attached to his consecrating act, the final “understood his purpose” reads as a gentle epiphany rather than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s calm perceptiveness is repeatedly labelled but never embodied in a risky micro-choice; the single action—lifting the feather—carries no visible cost or contradiction, so interiority remains ornamental rather than crucible-tested. The “collective healing” motive is declared, not dramatized through her body or a forfeiture, leaving motivation static across the arc. The villagers appear as a chorus without individual status pressure, so Mara’s isolation never collides with another will; absence of relational crucible flattens characterization. The promised flaw of obsessive archival control is never allowed to complicate the outcome, so no earned mistake drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s quiet resolve is credibly grounded in her marginal-scholar backstory; the notebook micro-choices show a hierarchy of values. Yet her interior contradiction stays general—“weathered innocence” is asserted more than dramatized in body or gesture. The final offering is motivated, but the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally forfeited. Still, the arc from reticence to resolve is legible and earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prophet’s precognitive amnesia is embodied in every line—he forgets tomorrow while carving driftwood runes. Interior contradiction pulses: clinging to echoes while accepting forgetting as tide. Micro-choices (chalk pressed to monolith, dust spread at dawn) externalize the internal arc. Endurance closure costs him the very future he seeks to record—felt, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The “sage camera repairer” is more a numinous functionary than a person: no contradiction, no flaw, no interior variance beyond serene competence. His single micro-choice—tighten the final screw—arrives without opposition or cost, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained, not earned. Because he never risks failure or disbelief, the arc lands as static icon rather than character. Still, the embodied ritual of listening to a leaf and calibrating gears keeps the score north of mid-line.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s serene, decisive kindness is shown through embodied action—cradling the shard, slow harp chords, staff keepsakes—giving her a credible, occupation-rooted interiority. Yet the arc is pure renunciation: no contradictory impulse tests her calm, so the “cost” is only elegiac beauty rather than a sharpened choice. The micro-choice to let the vinyl crackle complete the song lands as tender ritual, not character-altering risk. Still, within the lyric frame, her quiet endurance feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s quietly deliberate nature is shown through tactile ritual (tracing glyphs, listening for the key) and her childhood riddle supplies a clean emotional engine. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final smile is proportionate to the cost of completing the loops. Yet she never faces a genuine contradiction or flaw that might complicate her success; the risk feels intellectual rather than personal, so the arc flirts with safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s “forgiving skeptic” duality is shown in her tactile, reverent handling of the tooth, but interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“constellations of redemption”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. The bone-setting motif is embodied in the spine-alignment sequence, yet the emotional cost is stated (“cold certainty”) rather than felt through bodily contradiction or risk. A credible micro-choice—placing the tooth—earns a modest shift, but the arc leans on summary rather than compounding mistakes that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically precise—“protected vulnerability” as both felt sensation and strategic stance—but her contradictory impulses (grief vs. caretaking) remain parallel rather than clashing in-scene; the amber pendant catalyzes action yet never endangers or re-prices her goal, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The novelist’s contradiction—yearning to bind hopes yet doubting the right—anchors every beat; embodied unease (“doubt gnawed at the edges”) and micro-choices (ritual placement of shell) stay particular. No second on-page character, so status crucible exempt. Final renunciation—closing notebook, pocketing shell—earns credible Earned Stasis with visible cost (story “settled into a calm that resonated like the sea after a storm”). Interiority never drifts into diagnostic label-speak, keeping voice individual.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s longing to “restore sacred practices” is stated early and her gentle agency (touching the tendril, playing the lyre) stays consistent. Emotion remains at a single reverent register—no contradiction or embodied cost is staged under pressure—so the arc feels more ritual procession than crucible. The final kneel and whispered promise register as quiet closure, not a path foreclosed with visible price. Characterization is coherent and atmospheric, but the absence of interior friction or risk limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the pulse in her ears, the glacier-pace of her fingers—yet the “heartbeat-into-map” motive stays lyrically asserted rather than dramatized as a hard choice under pressure. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the risk she bears is cosmic-poetic, not personal or social, so the promised covenant feels abstract despite lush embodiment. Still, the final smile and inhaled orchard give a credible renunciation: she will return forever, paying with seasonal labor. That Earned Stasis lands cleanly and justifies the elevated score.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corin’s interiority is textured—his “peripherally focused” stance is shown through micro-choices like angling bronze plates and polishing the quartz. Yet the emotional contradiction is mostly reported (“quiet triumph”) rather than embodied in a body-in-crisis moment, and the final renunciation (accepting that the cellar is a library, not prison) arrives without a dramatized cost on the page—he simply “realized.” The locksmith’s competence is lovingly specific, but the absence of visible struggle or error undercuts the flaw/compound test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.2)
    The fractal weaver’s motive—“to collect the weights of different burdens” and unbind grotto sorrow—is declared repeatedly but never tested by counter-impulse or micro-choice; interiority is cosmic-lyric (“whispered to each weight”) rather than embodied contradiction. No visible cost or forfeiture attaches to her absorption of burdens; the lamp, not her body, pays the freight. Character remains a wind-chime voice, not a crucible of conflicting desire.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s grief-carving motive is clear and embodied, but her interiority stays poetic-sad rather than contradictory; we see no moment where she almost stops or chooses a different tool. The “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted, never tested against a second option, so her micro-choices feel pre-ordained. The final Charged Poise is earned, yet the cost is ambient (loss already happened) rather than freshly paid on the page. Still, the single-POV widow stance is specific and the carving act tracks her pulse—no head-hop or label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to wonder yet bartering it away—surface only in summary; no single beat shows both desires colliding. The ghost never applies counter-pressure; it merely hovers, so her final vow feels pre-decided. Interiority is vivid (“tears slipped…beads of regret that finally found a place to rest”), but the embodied cost is stated, not dramatized in a micro-choice. Still, the erosion-of-ambition arc stays coherent and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The intern’s functional-creative trait is stated repeatedly but never tested by failure or trade-off; every calculation succeeds without visible struggle, so the “earned” resurrection feels gift-wrapped rather than paid for. No contradictory impulse or embodied emotion appears under pressure; she never doubts, tires, or weighs ethical cost. The final smile is unanchored from any forfeiture, so the arc lands as competent but not transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scribe’s quiet endurance and tactile micro-choices (inscribing numerals, whispering to stone) embody his contradictory need for both solitude and reconciliation; the interior arc from shame to embered acceptance is earned and costs him the safety of guild approval. Interiority is concrete (“each stroke a sigh”), never drifting into diagnostic labels. The “abandoned dream” functions as a living antagonist he must befriend, a credible inner bear. No external relationships on page, so status crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The seeker’s interiority is concrete—his fingers on the brass, the pulse in his palm—and the sundial-driven micro-choices (aligning gnomon to gears, whispering the promise) show a hierarchy of values. The arc from “legend-chaser” to “salvager of truth” is visible, and the final tucking of the warmed dial into the satchel gives a tactile cost. Flaw: the motive “understand the architecture of lies” is stated more than dramatized; we see no moment where a specific lie guts him. Still, the embodied ritual of repair earns the renunciation of false spires.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The collector’s “infinite patience” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete moment where impatience would cost him; interiority drifts into lyric cipher (“felt the weight of centuries”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice shows him tempted to hurry, so the promised flaw never complicates action. The fishermen’s silent offering is a nice status echo, yet he remains solitary and untested, reducing arc to atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The traveler’s interior contradiction—chronicling death-in-life while craving healing—is dramatized through the tactile act of threading absent names into a living rose. Embodied micro-choices (kneeling, lifting, projecting) reveal a hierarchy of values where record-keeping is both penance and promise. The final renunciation—slipping the glowing thread away—pays the cost of perpetual solitude, earned by the prior beats of intimate projection.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prince’s yearning for “something softer” is declared, not dramatized; his only embodied contradiction is tattered robes vs. crown. Micro-choices (salvaging gears, whispering theories) are vivid but never complicate or foreclose a path—no moment where he risks or loses anything tangible. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“quaking reverie”) that blurs specific stakes. Closure feels gifted by the bird’s eruption, not paid for by a visible, character-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich—“firefighter born to an arsonist father” tension pulses, embodied in boots on black sand and pulse-heat. The contradiction (flame vs. healing) is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choice (kneel, thread-touch) reprises lineage but still feels slightly tidy; cost is felt more as legacy weight than immediate risk. Voice is distinct; no head-count chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s luminous skepticism is shown through her tactile tracing of symbols and the quiet refusal to accept myth at face value; interiority is concrete (“she inhaled the hush”). The internal contradiction—doubt vs. need to believe—peaks when she whispers names to the box, a micro-choice that costs her composure. Patient endurance is earned by prior star-taught stillness, and the final smile shows a credibly paid shift. Voice remains coherent, though the prose occasionally drifts into lyric shorthand that blurs embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lone "otherworldly sentimentalist" remains a poetic cipher; no interior contradiction or embodied emotion complicates her vow. The gear-handling beats are ritual, not choice, so cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. The final smile is graceful but not earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eliam’s meditative nature is evoked lyrically, but interiority stays abstract (“a fiercely meditative river”) without embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice shows him risking error or revising tactics, so the arc feels observed rather than earned. The sister and villagers remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent. Closure relies on symbolic recognition, not a decision that costs him anything visible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s “ethically diligent” label is repeated but never tested by a conflicting choice; the rake-handle ritual is shown three times yet never endangers her values, so the trait feels safely decorative rather than crucible-forged. Interiority drifts into cosmic sermon (“stitch the frayed tapestry of time”) that abstracts her body and blurs immediate stakes. Micro-choices—placing, aligning, whispering—are present but low-cost; no moment forces her to sacrifice comfort or reputation, so the arc is a gentle confirmation rather than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    The gardener’s interiority is poetic but thin; intentions are declared (“to discover the shape of intentions”) yet never tested by opposition. His single micro-choice—slipping the map into the case—reads as fait accompli rather than pressured decision. No contradictory impulse or visible cost forecloses a path; the blithe affect stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is present but abstract: “to seed innovation within a constraint” is stated, never dramatized as a craving or fear. Interiority drifts into thematic labels (“true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. Only one micro-choice—traced arrows on the lattice—earns causal weight; the rest is summary. No cost or flaw complicates his victory; he ends unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s calm precision and “thistled” steadiness are shown through her meticulous copying and the way her presence soothes literal dust—an embodied, character-specific quirk. The interior contradiction between her quiet exterior and the covert piracy she embraces is dramatized when she “cloaks herself in the song,” a micro-choice that visibly costs her neutrality. Her final quiet pride lands as credible endurance rather than epiphany, foreclosing silence without sentimental uplift, though the copyist profession remains more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    A solitary, nameless ritualist whose only motivation—"to crystallize a fleeting emotion"—is stated rather than dramatized; interiority is lyrically textured ("weight of unfinished stories") but emotionally monolithic, lacking contradictory impulse or visible flaw. The micro-choice to sprinkle powder is repeated with identical cadence, so no hierarchy of values is tested; the mask drop supplies a moment of vulnerability, yet the cost (a mournful lullaby) is poetic assertion, not embodied consequence. No relationship crucible or status shift is possible in a one-character scene, so the arc is purely emblematic; the endurance itself is the change, and the porcelain lattice visible on the floor supplies faint, late cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The solitary “philosopher” is vividly interior—contradictory impulses (rational vs. rebellious) play out in the act of sifting silt and choosing to encode both fleets’ stories. The micro-choice to document both methods at visible cost (notebook stained, cog ticking at page edge) earns a credible endurance. No second character means relationship crucible is N/A; flaw/competence balance is present but stays in safety zone—no real error compounds. Interiority is concrete, but occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) drifts from POV lexicon, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    “expectantly resigned” is a vivid contradiction that motivates the opening beat; it lands as interior summary rather than embodied moment. She never struggles against that contradiction in-scene—no hesitation, trembling, or visible cost—so the trait flattens into label. The children and veteran arrive too late to test her under pressure; her final “quiet thrill” is asserted, not dramatized. The renunciation (accepting gradual cultural loss) is legible, but because we never see her pay a concrete price, the arc feels gently observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s memory-tasting is vivid in the tasting beats and her interiority (“flavors of childhood, loss, and hope”) is specific. Motivation is anchored early (“create something beautiful from the ruins”) and later tested by the alignment. The “gentle rebellion” choice is a micro renunciation that costs her the safety of the old world, but the emotional contradiction is stated more than dramatized; still, the cost is visible when she smiles at the glowing canopy she can never taste again. Interior voice stays coherent, no head-hopping, and the flaw (obsessive hope) fuels the risk, so the arc is earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s involuntary truthfulness is a vivid, embodied trait—her confession “I had hoped the drone would bring back the lost chorus” is a micro-choice that costs her mystique and bends the ritual toward communion. The interior contradiction—duty to routine vs. longing for wonder—remains present but is stated more than dramatized; we’re told she “swore to preserve wonder” rather than seeing that oath tested under fire. The lone drone’s reappearance is the pivot, yet Mara’s agency is largely receptive: she inserts key, watches light cascade, receives answer “Echo.” Earned stasis is credible—she accepts the echo as enough and keeps truthful toll—yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral because the scene never endangers her job or safety.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s “creeping normality noticer” vocation is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure shows him failing or refining his noticing. The only visible decision—placing the shard on the bench—lacks stakes or cost, so the closing “sanctification” feels gifted, not earned. Interiority drifts into lyric generalities (“world smooth itself into habit”) that could belong to any reflective wanderer. Still, the perceptual filter is consistent, and the elderly woman momentarily tests his gaze, keeping the score above the mid-line.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The statue’s telepathic kindness is the only agency on stage; it urges but nothing pushes back. Without a second will to test or refuse it, the interior contradiction never sharpens into risk. The “incisively kind” trait is announced repeatedly but never costs the statue anything. The arc is therefore a gentle diffusion of nuance rather than a crucible that forces a renunciation or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aric’s interiority is vivid—equations scratched onto stone, the dice’s chipped face as “wounded star”—and his obsession tightens across beats. The final smile shows earned contradiction: cage/key at once. Yet we never see an explicit micro-choice under momentary duress; the tilt is mechanical, not visceral, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait are asserted but not embodied; she never visibly struggles to stay awake, so the insomnia reads as a label. The key choice—leaving the kindness note—is endearing yet low-stakes and feels pre-planned, not pressured by an interior contradiction. Missing a beat where her hope actually wobbles costs full credibility. Still, her quiet perseverance and tactile brush-cleaning give her a distinct heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora’s motive—reviving art to keep displaced souls intact—stays consistent, but her interiority is delivered in lyrical paraphrase (“rosewater dread”) rather than scene-level contradiction. The artisan-revival beat is dramatized, yet the decisive choice (breaking the first loaf) is communal, diffusing individual cost. No contradictory impulse is staged inside her; she is more conductor than pressured agent. Meets basic Change/Stasis test, but micro-choice hierarchy is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clock-maker’s lone-wolf interiority is vivid—his palms hum against the hunger-stone, his pulse syncs to the yoyo’s counter-spin—but we never see a contradictory impulse that could cost him the mission. The “bleak exhilaration” is declared repeatedly rather than dramatized as a value conflict (e.g., fear of erasing islanders’ fate vs. lust for authorship). Because no micro-choice visibly risks failure, the final triumph feels pre-ordained, not earned renunciation. Still, his perceptual signature is sharp enough to keep the score just below the 9+ gate that demands visible cost tied to flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mara’s interiority is largely atmospheric (“swallowed the clasp…cold weight seep into her veins”) rather than contradictory impulse; the single micro-choice (placing the clasp) is under-motivated because her want/fear matrix is never given concrete stakes beyond generic dread. Advisor functions as expository chorus, not secondary pressure, so relationship crucible is absent. Earned change is asserted by images rather than dramatized cost; the refusal bargain lands as external label, not internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is legible—he wants every obstacle to become music—but character interiority stays lyrical and generic, never contradictory or specific. No enduring personal flaw or cost is dramatized; the prophet’s stance simply succeeds and sails on. Micro-choices are replaced by macro-metaphor: he “responds,” “senses,” “realizes” rather than deciding between live risks. Earned cost is absent; closure is satisfied stasis, not renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to unlock the watchers while fearing the city’s fossil-fate—remains embodied (ink-slick fingers, hunched spine) and drives every micro-choice. The reed-whistle beats act as visible micro-decisions that tighten her resolve; her final vow to “keep listening” costs her the safety of ignorance, sealing Earned Stasis with felt price. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are waived; her competence is balanced by the genuine risk of pattern-misreading. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labelling (“quietly driven”) early on, but the embodied action soon overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlen's emotionally rational stance is vividly dramatized—he pries the mailbox with salvaged steel, catalogs symbols while feeling heat from the parchment, and accepts that dismantling the gilded narrative will hurt. The interior contradiction between empathy and cold analysis is alive in every beat; his final smile is earned because the page has shown him paying the price of dismantling a protective myth. No stock labels, no amnesia of motive; even the ivy retreating under the letter’s glow feels like a physical register of his internal shift. Minor: we never see him risk explicit social cost (loss of reputation, job, friendship), so the cost is conceptual rather than personal, keeping this just under 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—stoic mask vs. trembling heart—is rendered through bodily detail (boots on moss, ink- warmed brass) rather than labels. The micro-choice to hide then retrieve the inkwell crystallizes her vow; the cost is the river’s slow erasure of every note she leaves. One slip: “archeologist of abandoned dreams” is self-diagnosis, not dramatized want, blunting motive edge.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s calm indexer persona is vividly embodied in her micro-choices— aligning brass gears, noting ink hue shifts—yet her interior contradictions remain thin; the “tranquilly perceptive” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The final moment of stamping the charter slab carries earned cost, but the transition from private scholar to civic defender feels sketched rather than pressured. No secondary character applies live pressure, so relationship crucible tests are waived. Competence dominates over flaw, muting the necessary struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lantern maker’s grief is stated rather than dramatized; “fold grief into origami cranes” is abstract and never tested by an on-page contradiction or loss. His interiority circles the same ache in ornate paraphrase (“luminous torment” repeated) without a micro-choice that complicates his stance. The cranes lift, but we don’t see him hesitate, miscut, or sacrifice anything to make them—so the emotional cost is inferred, not embodied. Voice is vivid, yet the absence of visible flaw or counter-desire keeps the arc schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Grief as fuel is credible; the visor adjustment and palm-thrust are concrete micro-choices. Missing antagonist or second character keeps relational pressure off-page; interiority leans lyric rather than contradictory under fire. The earned shift from loss to clarity lands, but the cost is more conceptual than embodied—no lingering wound or forfeited tool. Still, the voice-specific perceptual tilt (“tasted of rust and ozone”) keeps him individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s perpetual surprise is shown through sensory micro-reactions (“felt a thrill,” “felt perpetually surprised”) rather than label-speak, and it modulates her risk tolerance at the lever beat. The pilgrim acts as pressure mirror, but his interiority is ventriloquized once (“eyes reflecting the same brilliant dimness”), preventing full 8+. The chip-choice cost is felt in her mind-snap of recognition, satisfying earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; surprise is reactive, not driving a forked decision.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—body feels the watch hand “warm in my palm” and guilt is rendered as a physical ledger—but the shift from mercenary to penitent relies on a single abstract phrase rather than a visible forfeit. The final renunciation is present but the cost is only asserted (“weight…lifted”), not dramatized; still, the voice-specific shame carries the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The negotiator’s interiority is textured—“furrowed hush,” the rope as personal fear—yet the contradictory impulses (guilt vs. hope) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat. The micro-choice to offer the box is present, but the cost (risk of renewed betrayal) is implied, not felt on the page. The veteran counterpart remains a silent mirror, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are absent. The arc lands as a credible renunciation, but the emotional trade-off is under-etched for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“his own heart, buoyed by hope yet weighed down by a lingering sorrow”—but the navigator’s contradictory impulses are described more than dramatized; the moment of alignment is declared rather than shown through a visible micro-choice that costs him something tangible. The “promise to the wind” is too abstract to register as a renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “dirty-ledger” past is vivid, but the promised internal contradiction (dirty vs. clean) never collides in a single pressured micro-choice; the mirror moment shows a teary alt-self yet the narrator’s embodied reaction is summary, not a visible renunciation that costs him something on the spot. Empathy remains an abstract want; no beat forces him to choose between self-interest and another being’s immediate pain, so the motivational engine idles rather than revs.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s yearning for Arion is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyric summary (“cosmic intimacy,” “infinite bond”) that tells us depth rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure; no micro-choice after the antler-touch registers a felt cost or irreversible trade-off, so the transformation reads as fated, not earned.

    The cartomancer’s paradoxical grief for “unborn sighs” gives her a sharp internal contradiction that stays active in-scene. Micro-choices—kneeling, unclasping the lid, whispering names—track her private vow and evolve under rising beauty. The final release of her “own heart” is the earned renunciation the story needs, yet we get no embodied cost (pain, fatigue, doubt) at the moment she gives up the grief; the prose tells the surrender rather than letting us feel it hit her body. Interiority is vivid but over-lyric; a few diagnostic abstractions (“choking beauty”) dilute embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nara’s pacifism is stated, never betrayed, yet never tested by an antagonist; the interior contradiction is lyrically sketched (“weightless with joy” vs. “cold pressure”) but stays abstract. Her micro-choice—smile to lighten, step through—earns the ending, but the absence of live opposition keeps the arc thin.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her feet sinking in “warm volcanic grit,” the jar trembling under volcanic breeze—yet her contradictory motives (exhausted giver vs. curious tracker of transformation) remain stated rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The final smile-and-walk settles for emotional shorthand instead of a micro-choice that costs her anything visible. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific enough to lift the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s calmly inventive trait stays credible and active—he deciphers the sundial, plants code-marks, endures the blackout patrol, and finally triggers the cradle. Interiority is concrete (“curiosity turned into quiet intrigue”) and embodied in the bronze quill’s tiny clinks. Yet the silent-revolution motive is declared rather than conflicted; we never feel him doubt or sacrifice, so the cost feels abstract. Still, within 600–800 words he undergoes a visible shift from guardian to conspirator, earned by his own micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene’s interior contradiction—coveting prophecy yet fearing its paralysis—remains alive in every beat: she kneels to the tide even as she calculates Fibonacci spirals. Her embodied awe (“skin shimmering with wet kelp”) and micro-choice to lay the final red stone externalize the stakes. The precognitive curse turns from prison to compass in a single, legible pivot. Cost is present—the flame drifts away, leaving her alone with perpetual foresight—but the endurance beat is slightly abstract; a more visceral sacrifice would lift this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s interior contradiction—needing to speak yet accepting censorship—drives every beat; the 23-minute choice is a visible micro-choice that costs him silence. Emotion is embodied in the climb, the envelope trembling, the timer ticking against his pulse. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The final descent carries earned stasis: he foregoes immediate publication, carrying the storm-kissed map instead, cost legible in the empty envelope left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The philosopher’s mechanical arm and sundial obsession give him a vivid silhouette, yet his interiority stays ornamental; we never feel contradictory wants under the duel’s pressure. The diplomat’s “diplomatically fierce” mask is stated repeatedly but never tested by a micro-choice that shows cost. The climactic alignment of needle-card + sundial shadow reads as author flourish, not earned character decision. Result: imaginative archetypes, but no lived-in vulnerability that forces a change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lira’s monthly personality molt is stated repeatedly (“each month she molted a new personality”) yet never alters a single on-page choice; the trait is ornamental rather than causal. Interiority drifts into lyric commentary (“wore the world’s wandering scars like a coat”) that tells emotion instead of showing contradiction under pressure. Rook is sketched as calm scholar but exerts no counter-pressure; their friendship is declared, not dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. No visible cost is attached to Lira’s final stance; the ending assertion “the world will hear its song” lacks a foreclosed path or earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrically specific—“steely longing” recurs as pulse rather than label—but the pianist’s contradictory impulses are only implied, not dramatized in a single visible beat. The final bow to “the lingering echo of his own heart” crystallizes earned stasis, yet we never see him choose against an alternative path; the cost is atmospheric, not tactile. No secondary character exerts pressure, so the crucible is purely intra-subjective—acceptable, but thinner than publish-now excellence demands.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—cataloguing dreams like weather charts—but the “empirically whimsical” trait is named more than dramatized; her final incantation feels slightly unearned because the prior beat shows translation of symbols but not a visible moment where her empirical side clashes with whimsy. The earned micro-choice is the whispered incantation, yet the cost (luminous doubt) is stated rather than embodied in gesture or sacrifice. Flaw is minor: the contradiction is present but not sharpened under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    Tutor’s vow is stated, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. Micro-choices (placing compass, reciting) are ceremonial, not pressured. Closure cost is diffuse, not personal—apology exhaled into wind leaves tutor unchanged. Interiority stays abstract (“sensed the tides…turning”) rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her shift from cosmic ambition to quiet observation feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., brushing dust into a vial, aligning it with light). Her motivation stems credibly from professional identity and personal humility, though the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction in-scene. No secondary characters dilute focus, allowing full embodiment of her arc. The final whisper to vines borders on diagnostic but is grounded by tactile decay and prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, tingling from heat, ground her trauma in physical sensation. Her motivation (to rebuild through the smuggler’s patterns) emerges organically from loss and aligns with her identity as a glass artist. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from survival to purpose lacks friction or contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice feels earned but not rigorously tested by internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—calloused hands, fluttering scarf, pulse against the tuning fork—and her motivation to “rectify the silence” emerges organically from trauma. Her micro-choice to activate the heat-mapping device reveals a hierarchy of values: confronting memory over comfort. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the transition from jagged scars to “calm line” lacks friction or contradictory impulse in-scene. No diagnostic label-speak, but the epiphany feels marginally unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlow’s motivation—giving rest a permanent address—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions with the lens and library. His inadvertent stubbornness manifests in micro-choices (e.g., placing shards in impossible spaces) that carry visible cost: physical strain, emotional burden, and final self-sacrifice. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory detail (“weight of centuries pressing against his chest”). The final renunciation—vanishing beneath the waves—is earned by prior causality and crystallizes his role as both guide and ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “gentle pressure of responsibility” and hope “like a tide” feel embodied, not diagnostic. Her motivation (intergenerational survival) intensifies under sanctions, driving tactical choices like the bell system. The story avoids tidy resolution: her endurance carries visible cost (isolation, constant vigilance), and her leadership is shown through micro-choices (ringing the bell, watching volunteers). However, secondary characters remain archetypal (elders, children), limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s spiritually curious nature is vividly embodied through sensory perception and breath-driven action, avoiding diagnostic labels. His motivation—to free unused love—is consistent and intensifies credibly under pressure. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he moves seamlessly from memory to mission without hesitation or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The final renunciation of the lens feels earned but arrives without visible struggle or cost beyond symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s retrocognitive condition and tactile relationship with time are vividly embodied, especially in her interaction with the fading photographs and the halo fragment. Her motivation—to dissolve static perception—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices like arranging decaying images along the maze’s spine. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves toward revelation without meaningful resistance or competing impulses in-scene. The child’s appearance offers external awe but doesn’t pressure Mara into a costly decision that reveals deeper hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—planting resilience against famine—and her actions align with it throughout. Her interiority is concrete (“remembering a lullaby her mother sang while planting beans”) and tied to embodied memory rather than abstraction. The chains symbolize oppression but also evolve meaningfully, culminating in their rusted loosening as earned freedom. However, the lack of internal contradiction or visible struggle beyond environmental obstacles slightly limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—translating memory-as-sound through color-hearing—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action from coral placement to forge-tending. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, grounding emotion in tactile perception (“listened to the faint teal of a dying rose”). However, her transformation lacks a decisive micro-choice under pressure; the climax is atmospheric rather than agentic, undercutting full character causality. The absence of interpersonal friction or tangible trade-offs softens the cost of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—preserving “illuminated moments”—is consistent and deepens credibly, but her interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“destiny’s symphony,” “whispers of forgotten travelers”) rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. Her “quietly savvy” trait is asserted more than demonstrated through micro-choices with visible cost. The shift from thief to guardian feels thematically sound but lacks friction; no internal resistance complicates her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “weighty lightness,” poetic narration of mundane acts, and tactile engagement with glass and ice reveal a psyche shaped by both grief and hope. Her motivation is consistent and deepened through micro-choices (e.g., marking days on the bookmark, narrating as liturgy). However, her transformation lacks a decisive renunciation or trade-off with visible cost; endurance is implied but not dramatized as foreclosing a path. The final peace feels earned emotionally but not causally tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling certainty, adaptive masking, and stunt-trained perception feel specific and grounded. Her contradictory impulses (fear vs. performance) act simultaneously, especially when decoding the cast through physical memory. However, the final transformation leans slightly into diagnostic self-awareness (“vulnerability is power”) that borders on label-speak, diluting the rawness of her earlier struggle. The confession of betrayal feels earned but lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oracle’s motivation—charting the endless night—is vividly embodied through his ritual with the gold leaf booklet and his sensory engagement with silence. His “mild obsession” manifests in micro-choices (e.g., sealing the map in his breath) that reveal a hierarchy of values: listening over seeing, hush over noise. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile perception (“ambered hush,” “pages shivered”). However, the character lacks internal contradiction; his devotion is unwavering, which softens the cost of his endurance despite its lyrical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The robot’s motivation—to find where thoughts come from—is credibly rooted in its new curiosity module and drives embodied action (magnetic fingertips over the violin). Internal contradiction is subtle but present: janitorial duty vs. existential inquiry. However, emotional embodiment leans abstract (“quiet awe,” “steady mind”) without visceral physicality under pressure. The final renunciation—returning to sweeping—is earned but lacks a visible cost beyond melted ice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her folded thoughts, tactile handling of the lens, and quiet resolve feel specific and consistent. Her motivation (to thaw mistrust through transparency) is rooted in past case experience and drives her micro-choices: lifting the lens, placing it on the mic, recording the event as a promise. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward illumination without hesitation or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The mayor’s arrival introduces external validation but no meaningful relational pressure that tests her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine dresser’s motivation is clear and consistent—his pragmatic devotion to proving the garden’s reciprocity—but his internal contradiction lacks embodied tension. His “blooming withering” duality is stated rather than dramatized through simultaneous, conflicting impulses. Micro-choices (polishing marbles) reveal values, yet emotional progression leans on lyrical abstraction over visceral struggle. The final endurance feels earned, but the cost remains conceptual rather than physically or relationally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her belief about time, and her actions align with that obsession. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored—she’s driven yet serene, with little friction between desire and cost. The “obliging” trait feels more decorative than determinative; it doesn’t shape a meaningful trade-off or error. Her emotional arc lacks a destabilizing moment where competence falters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—driven by reverence, curiosity, and a desire to free a trapped melody—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is embodied through tactile interaction with water-damaged floorboards and the antique program, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice (to play) feels earned, though the absence of internal contradiction slightly limits depth; her resolve never wavers, reducing emotional complexity. Still, her micro-choices (tracing imprints, aligning note with symbol) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mirela’s interiority is vividly embodied—fever, smudging ink, swallowed lie—and her micro-choices (adjusting the barometer, folding the illustration) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Motivation stems from consistent traits: truth-seeking through sensory fusion, fault tolerance as both algorithm and ethos. The lie’s physicality (“pine sap and cold stone”) grounds emotional conflict without therapy-speak. Final renunciation—carrying weight outward—is earned by prior causality and forecloses inward containment.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s skepticism and drowsy alertness are embodied consistently, and his renunciation of the valve wheel feels earned as Earned Stasis. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped—his recklessness and skepticism rarely clash in-scene, reducing emotional friction. The final cost (“weight… lingered”) is felt but not dramatized through concrete bodily or behavioral change. His traits function more as atmospheric filters than drivers of conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The keeper’s motivation—witnessing without judgment—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the library and swan. His internal contradiction (desire for renewal vs. duty of detachment) is subtly rendered, especially when he dissolves into silence yet reemerges to record. However, his final choice lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; the “fleeting peace” feels weightless rather than earned through sacrifice. The trait “grips reality loosely” remains descriptive rather than consequential in action.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory and emotional specificity, especially in her tactile connection to the locket and harp. Her motivation—to nurture wonder—is consistent and embodied, yet her “cautious exuberance” remains more a lyrical descriptor than a contradiction tested under pressure. No meaningful internal conflict or trade-off emerges; she executes her role flawlessly without struggle or blind spots. The absence of genuine friction or flawed decision-making limits character depth despite vivid portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s motivation—collecting “stories walls have heard”—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with tapestry, diaries, and stone. His “sensitively perceptive” trait drives micro-choices (pressing fabric to brick, matching glyphs) that feel earned, not diagnostic. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized; his emotional state remains monolithic, lacking simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of passive archiving for active realignment is credible but lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The writer’s motivation is vividly rendered, and his internal contradiction—accidental prophecy versus deliberate encoding—is compelling. However, his emotional embodiment remains abstract; feelings are named (“surge of purpose”) rather than physically felt. The final choice lacks micro-behavior that reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. His flaw (unintended revelation) is stated but not dramatized in action with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Loop Pedal Priest is vividly rendered through idiosyncratic perception and ritual action, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—he acts with near-perfect clarity under pressure, missing the flawed struggle expected at this tier. His motivation is consistent, yet his emotional state remains abstract (“calm resolve,” “fear smoothed”) rather than viscerally felt. The final renunciation carries conceptual weight but no on-page cost to his person—his soul is threatened but not scarred. For 9+ eligibility, a moment of genuine doubt or physical toll was needed.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lian’s motivation—becoming a conductor of unheard symphonies—is rooted in chronologically homesick longing, embodied through tactile memory (sand between toes, nautilus shell) and micro-choices (aligning shell with horizon, sketching on frost). Her internal contradiction—yearning for past yet seeking future expression—fuels credible action without diagnostic self-awareness. Final renunciation of passive fortune-writing for active conducting is earned through prior sensory mapping. However, the transition from writer to conductor lacks a visible cost beyond emotional shift; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path weakens the “felt cost” requirement for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gravity defier’s internal conflict—between regret, ambition, and fractured selves—is rendered through embodied sensation (“weightless boots,” “pulse” syncing with the tablet) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation to “conquer the labyrinth of self” intensifies credibly as the procedural algorithm forces micro-choices that align or misalign with his resolve. However, the final acceptance of all timelines leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient on-page struggle; the emotional cost is implied but not viscerally dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marin’s motivation—to defeat emotional numbness—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with silence and music, yet her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; her resolve is steady, not fraught. The deaf music teacher premise is compelling but risks archetype without deeper psychological friction. Her actions align consistently with motive, and the final rewinding feels earned. However, the absence of struggle or doubt flattens emotional complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her meticulousness shapes perception (“felt its secret like a pulse in her own chest”) and drives micro-choices (tracing the pigeon’s route inward). Her motivation to “nurture integrity in solitude” feels consistent and costly, though the cat companion borders on sentimental reinforcement rather than true friction. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions layer through sensory immersion. Final renunciation isn’t tested under true opposition, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s motivation is deeply rooted in sensory memory and grief, consistently embodied through his cautious interactions with scent and light. His internal conflict—between longing for clarity and fear of overwhelming sorrow—is rendered through tactile detail rather than exposition. The final renunciation (cataloging sorrowful scents) feels earned, with visible emotional cost. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-resistance during the vapor’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s motivation—discovering “the texture of time”—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions with rope, stone, and light. His “ethically playful” demeanor manifests in micro-choices (e.g., binding the rope instead of releasing it) that reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving layered memory over personal liberation. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge via sensory perception (“soft, grainy, humming”) rather than abstraction. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality—the frayed coil’s transformation from prison tool to narrative anchor—and carries visible cost: sealing the escaped soul’s echo.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The violinist’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is consistent and embodied through her tactile engagement with sound, earth, and memory. Her acoustically perceptive trait shapes her perception without veering into diagnostic label-speak. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we see her choice to play but not the struggle preceding it. The final renunciation of silence is earned, yet lacks a visible micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “affectionate detachment” manifests in precise micro-choices (e.g., sealing the vial with ritual care) that reveal a hierarchy of values: commerce over sentiment, insight over comfort. Her motivation to “fuse insight with empathy” is consistent and intensifies through tactile engagement with the petal. However, her emotional contradiction remains implied rather than enacted under pressure; we see no competing impulse that threatens her control. The courier’s arrival hints at future stakes but doesn’t test her current resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., slipping the locket into the courier’s bag), but her “cautious exuberance” borders on label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene. Her motivation to uplift silent contributors emerges organically from memory, yet lacks friction—no visible tradeoff challenges her resolve. The lighthouse keeper mirrors her emotional state too neatly, flattening relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and consistent—her “boldly sympathetic” nature drives her to seek connection through reed sculpture and communal ritual. Her interiority is embodied in tactile, sensory responses (“feeling each ripple of sorrow… as if it were a personal ache of light”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice—to declare the arbor a sanctuary—is earned by prior actions and resonates with cost: she binds herself permanently to the community’s fragile web. However, secondary characters remain archetypal (villagers as luminous hope-carriers), limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as an illustrator who “coaxes the soul from a fossil,” and her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“pendant warm against her skin,” “ink capturing the way light fractured”). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward revelation without internal friction or missteps. The final renunciation (releasing the pendant) feels earned but leans on symbolic logic over psychological struggle. No secondary characters appear to pressure or complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conjurer’s motivation—understanding the “mathematics of emotion”—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (placing glass eyes, tracing fissures), but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves with serene certainty rather than struggle. His gentle inventiveness feels more like a label than a tested trait under pressure. The emotional arc is coherent but leans toward epiphany over earned transformation, risking unearned optimism. Still, his micro-choices (aligning eyes, stepping onto the bridge) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “kindly methodical” nature shapes micro-choices like caching the fragment and stepping forward at dawn. However, her motivation to “become visible” arrives as an epiphany rather than evolving through contradictory impulses in-scene. The final transformation feels earned thematically but lacks a prior moment of resistance or doubt that would ground the emotional cost. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics aren’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlowe’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“smile bending like a willow branch,” “heart steady”) and micro-choices (placing copper wire, stepping back), revealing a character whose scientific curiosity and humility intertwine. His motivation—studying post-storm plant behavior—is consistent and intensifies into meaningful action. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves from observation to acceptance without palpable struggle or resistance, softening the emotional stakes. The final renunciation of control feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—to “thresh meaning from experience”—is compellingly embodied through her insomnia, painting, and tactile interaction with the island. Her internal contradiction (yearning for sleep yet fueled by wakeful grief) drives consistent, high-stakes choices. The amber brooch exchange feels earned because it aligns with her established value hierarchy: art as vessel for collective memory. However, her emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“haggard awe,” “meaning she had long been threshing”) rather than fully dramatized sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and poetic metaphor, yet her motivation lacks concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. She seeks the cave pearl with minimal friction—her clairvoyance “not seeing it coming” remains a lyrical premise rather than a source of flawed decision-making under pressure. The pilgrim exerts no active opposition, reducing relational dynamics to atmospheric presence. Her final realization feels earned thematically but not causally compelled by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s motivation—to compile fragments into meaning—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions with the valve and harbor detritus. His “reactively visionary” trait is shown, not told, via anticipatory listening and pattern recognition. However, his internal contradiction remains muted; we see endurance but not struggle. The exile’s emotional weight is implied rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mapper’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “analytically artistic” nature, and her internal contradiction—precision versus imagination—fuels micro-choices like tracing pavement cracks or pressing the phantom punch into the lock. Her transformation from observer to conduit feels earned, with cost implied through irreversible commitment. However, emotional embodiment occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“trembling certainty”) rather than visceral sensation, slightly softening the peak beat’s physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her skepticism and wonder coexist in micro-choices like offering tea to the wind or whispering apologies to stars. Her transformation from analytical transcriber to conduit of shared memory feels earned, with each action revealing her hierarchy of values. The contradiction between logic and longing operates simultaneously, not as alternating moods. Final renunciation—leaving the tile as a lighthouse for others—carries visible cost: solitude exchanged for communal sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The immortal’s ennui and curiosity are embodied through tactile perception (“fingertips tingling,” “lover’s sigh”) and micro-choices (pressing the amulet to the seam rather than speaking). His final renunciation of emptiness feels earned, though his internal contradiction—boredom versus yearning for purpose—is more implied than actively warring in-scene. The twin reflection risks veering into diagnostic label-speak but is grounded by prismatic sensory continuity. Cost is felt in the dissolution of his former self, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “deliberate stillness” and tactile awareness of grief as vibration ground her in a specific perceptual mode. Her motivation (proving lineage through fair-trade math) is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses escape into deception. However, her internal contradiction between inherited cunning and honest intent remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; the shift feels earned but slightly abstracted at peak stress. The final resolve lacks a micro-choice with immediate cost beyond symbolic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stationer’s motivation is consistent and his studious nature shapes his actions, but his interiority leans toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. He lacks a visible flaw or blind spot that generates meaningful friction—his perseverance feels noble but untested. The final realization about invented histories as bridges arrives without prior struggle or cost that would make it earned. His character serves the theme more than drives it through personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in erased identity and the tactile pursuit of memory—is consistent and embodied. Their internal contradiction (nameless void vs. archivist purpose) fuels credible micro-choices, like following the label’s glow or tucking it away. However, the final renunciation lacks a specific, dramatized cost beyond abstract “purpose,” slightly undercutting Earned Stasis. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory layering (“cold filament that tingled”).

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selene’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception—her “gloomy cheerfulness,” tactile interactions with the seashell and cello, and micro-choices (placing the shell, lifting the ledger) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in curiosity over certainty. Her motivation ties cohesively to her myth-busting identity and late mentor, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; wonder and melancholy coexist but don’t actively war. The final renunciation—accepting myth as living art—is earned, though the cost (abandoning definitive truth) remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—loyalty to anarchic joy versus promise to dock workers—is vividly rendered and drives her pivotal choices. Her “orderly intuitive mind” enables concrete action (decoding the map, directing artists), not just observation. However, emotional embodiment occasionally drifts into summary (“hopeful desperation that rose like steam”) rather than sensory immediacy. The final renunciation—balancing both worlds without full resolution—feels earned but lacks a sharper on-page cost beyond atmospheric tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inspector’s "purposefully curious" trait is embodied in precise actions—calibrating chemicals, choosing a historic lens—and his grief feels earned, not performative. His micro-choices (e.g., rigging the shutter to a chemical timer) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over convenience. However, interior contradiction remains muted; his emotional arc leans toward elegiac certainty rather than simultaneous, clashing impulses under pressure. The final whisper borders on diagnostic label-speak but is rescued by its concrete framing as an offering.

    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile and auditory perception, and her motivation—to decode drone feedback for future navigation—drives precise micro-choices (e.g., using water refraction). Her blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that shapes method and stakes. However, the emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; her “magnetic calm” remains unchallenged, flattening internal conflict. The final renunciation of personal recognition in favor of craft feels earned but costless on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s dry wit and subtle confidence are embodied through precise micro-choices—lighting the lamp, aligning the transmitter—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation to map the river’s origin emerges organically from her role as an atlas editor confronting obsolete knowledge. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest physically (“trembling fingertip,” “quiet dread”). The final renunciation of passive observation for active transmission is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tuner’s motivation—restoring balance—is consistent and embodied through ritualized action, but his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see patience as trait, not struggle. His micro-choices (placing the fork, nodding to workers) reveal values, yet no visible cost accrues to him personally—his endurance lacks sacrifice. The final departure feels earned but emotionally frictionless, missing a moment where his patience is tested or compromised. Still, his actions align tightly with motive, and the ebony fork serves as both tool and extension of self.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation evolves credibly from obsession to purposeful sacrifice, and her internal conflict—fear versus wonder—is embodied in tactile detail (“unsnares the tight coil of panic”). The final renunciation of the distress beacon feels earned by prior emotional groundwork. However, the shift from personal desire to altruistic pledge leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choice scaffolding under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The boy’s motivation—redemption through guiding others—is clear and rooted in his legacy as “the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son.” His interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into abstraction (“chasing hush”) rather than concrete contradiction. The lattice and mother’s absence anchor his emotional arc, yet his choices lack tangible friction or trade-offs; he moves unimpeded through the prison. Final renunciation of false alarms feels earned thematically but not dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ghost bride’s motivation—repaying a cross-lifetime debt—is vividly embodied through her actions with the bead and interactions with the vines. Her internal contradiction (loving yet venomous affection) manifests in tangible gestures, like releasing the fatal sigh. However, her emotional arc leans slightly on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete micro-choices under pressure; the transformation feels more atmospheric than psychologically earned. Still, her final renunciation carries visible cost and aligns with prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The weaver’s motivation is clear and consistent—carving reverence from ruin—but her interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Emotions are filtered through poetic metaphor (“hauntingly optimistic heart,” “orchid solace”) without tangible struggle or flawed decision-making. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but the core flaw is diagnostic label-speak in peak beats (“her hauntingly optimistic heart beat in rhythm with the stone”) that flattens emotional complexity. Her endurance feels noble but untested by genuine error or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—restoring faith through ancestral reconnection—is consistent and emotionally grounded, with micro-choices like placing the sundial base showing reverence over haste. Her “warmly curious” trait informs perception but rarely creates tension or cost; it functions more as mood than driver. Interiority leans poetic over contradictory, missing layered emotional conflict under pressure. Final endurance feels earned, though the absence of tangible sacrifice softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—to discover meaning in the margins—is vividly embodied through her chalk rituals and stylus work, revealing a coherent interiority shaped by nostalgic longing and creative rigor. Her actions align with her “carefully inventive” nature, especially in how she embeds intention into envelopes. However, her internal conflict remains underexplored; we see desire but not contradiction or struggle that tests her limits. The final renunciation (mailing identity as concept) feels earned but lacks a visible emotional cost that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    The embroiderer’s motivation—to listen for unheard stories—is embodied through tactile, ritualized action rather than exposition. Her internal contradiction (wisdom disguised as foolishness) manifests in her quiet defiance of official narratives, and her micro-choices—synchronizing stitch with flame, interpreting leaf-rustle as code—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, and her competence borders on uncanny without visible struggle, slightly softening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The medium’s interiority is richly embodied—her “unsent letters” function as visceral emotional weights, not abstractions. Her micro-choices (placing the shard, evoking voices) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over silence, vulnerability over control. However, her motivation lacks friction; the “fierce tenderness” guiding her feels asserted rather than tested by genuine contradiction or struggle. No blind spots or misbeliefs complicate her path—the resolution arrives too cleanly for the depth implied.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The translator’s “shrewdly innocent” interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., placing the coral vial beside the cast), but her motivation leans on abstract phrasing (“graft new meaning onto old wounds”) without sufficient friction or contradiction under pressure. The child’s presence offers relational stakes, yet their interaction lacks reciprocal agency—mostly passive reception rather than co-creation of meaning. Emotional embodiment falters slightly in peak moments with lyrical abstraction (“lotus-hearted ache”) over concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The artist’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to restore joy through luminous art. Her interiority is rendered with poetic specificity (“half awake, half imagined,” “pensive mirth”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves seamlessly from sorrow to hope without resistance or struggle, flattening the cost of her mission. The absence of internal friction weakens the credibility of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with her “methodically playful” trait embodied in brushwork and choices. Her shift from certainty to curiosity feels earned through sensory engagement rather than epiphany. However, the transformation leans slightly on lyrical assertion (“nested awakening within each brushstroke”) without sufficient prior contradiction—her certainty lacks tangible resistance. The final renunciation of comfort carries emotional weight but minimal concrete cost beyond internal reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysander’s motivation—guarding his “spark of defiance”—is vividly embodied through concrete actions (planting coded seedlings, whispering to the gourd seed) and consistent internal logic. His emotional state is conveyed through sensory engagement rather than diagnostic labels. However, Dr. Mirabel’s shift from observer to ally lacks sufficient interior friction or micro-choice; her conversion feels more thematic convenience than earned character turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The insomniac poet’s interiority is richly embodied—his “shyly unstoppable” nature manifests in trembling humility and relentless yearning that coexist without contradiction. His motivation to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” drives every action, and his final renunciation (letting lullabies dissolve into the wind) carries the cost of centuries of solitude. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, and his epiphany about the postcard as a seed edges toward diagnostic phrasing (“not merely a messenger but a seed”) without sufficient micro-choice anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s interiority is richly embodied through sensory detail (“foxglove regret,” “violet sorrow”) and consistent micro-choices (aligning the chime, refilling the candle). Her motivation—to preserve forgotten names—is dramatized through ritual rather than stated, and her emotional arc from regret to gratitude feels earned. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her devotion is unwavering, reducing tension. The final whisper of a new name shows quiet agency but doesn’t foreclose a tangible alternative path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “carefully reckless” tension manifests in tactile choices (e.g., whispering promises to glyphs) and emotional specificity (cautious exuberance). Her motivation—to restore broken trust—drives every action with clear stakes. However, her flaw lacks tangible consequence; no real mistake fractures the process, softening the cost of failure. The final pledge feels earned but leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and embodied—her “slyly heartfelt” mission drives micro-choices like analyzing adhesive residue and connecting the chain to the valve. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; emotional complexity leans toward lyrical summary (“encrypted compassion pulse through her fingertips”) rather than messy, embodied struggle. The council elder’s late appearance lacks sufficient pressure or status dynamics to test Mira’s stance under interpersonal friction. Final renunciation of pure progress for empathetic balance is earned but feels slightly smoothed by the story’s poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motivation—preserving lost songs through fragile, tangible acts—is rooted in grief and expressed through consistent, embodied choices (e.g., attaching meteorite slivers to pigeons). Her internal conflict between loss and trust manifests in micro-decisions that layer emotion without diagnostic self-awareness. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from isolation to communal resonance occurs with minimal resistance or setback, softening the cost of reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The child’s motivation—driven by lineage, loss, and a yearning for sacred thresholds—is consistent and emotionally embodied, particularly in tactile interactions with copper, wood grain, and glass. However, his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see determination but not competing impulses that complicate choice. The final renunciation (returning to the maze as guardian) is earned through sensory intuition, yet lacks a visible trade-off beyond abstract “shedding weight.” His agency feels guided more by atmosphere than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s motivation—to learn the “rhythm of belonging”—is consistent and emotionally resonant, but her interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The burnt feather and fireflies function more as symbolic conduits than catalysts for tangible decisions with visible cost. While her actions align with her role as a landscape astrologer, the lack of internal friction or flawed missteps reduces psychological depth. The final realization feels earned thematically but not causally through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied through sea-foam recollectionist traits and micro-choices (e.g., pressing seeds to glass, stepping toward teal hues). Her motivation—to recover vanishing paths before memory fades—drives coherent action under pressure. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the realization about “emotional resonance” arrives cleanly without prior contradiction or misstep. Still, her flawed yet purposeful pursuit earns credible endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The performer’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete actions—rearranging bishops, interpreting ripples—but his motivation borders on abstract idealism without sufficient contradictory impulses. His “calculated wilderness” is compelling yet lacks a tangible counterforce that would deepen internal conflict. The child’s giggle and audience reactions provide external validation but don’t pressure his choices. Final renunciation isn’t tested; he simply repeats his ritual, limiting emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation—to inscribe a cosmic verse on mortal skin—is consistent and intensifies through embodied choices, especially her use of the moonstone speck and passage through “gaps.” Her internal contradiction (exile vs. connection) is shown in action, not summary. However, her emotional arc resolves with near-perfect calibration, lacking the irrational friction that would make her epiphany feel fully earned under pressure. The final renunciation of exile reads as graceful but slightly tidy for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and poetic ritual, but her motivation remains abstract rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her “unsettled thoughts” are stated, not embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The stone-tossing ritual reveals worldview more than active struggle, and no path is foreclosed with visible cost—only a mood shifts. This is reflective characterization without decisive agency.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “hard softness,” scarred skin, and silent stitching of grief feel specific and lived-in. Her motivation to translate pain into a universal language is consistent and intensifies through her handling of the box. However, the final choice to return innocence lacks a clear prior causal chain; the hikers’ “unspoken thanks” appear as vision rather than earned consequence. The absence of on-page interaction with others limits relational pressure, though single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin’s motivation—balancing logic and hope—is clear and consistent, driving his actions throughout. However, his internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied; we’re told he is a “logical dreamer” but rarely see contradictory impulses clash in real-time decisions. His emotional arc lacks specific, felt struggle—hope is conceptualized, not viscerally contested. The final choice feels earned thematically but not through on-page psychological friction with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in generational duty and sensory perception. Her interiority is concrete—she feels the “weight of history settle like warm ash”—and her micro-choices (tracing lines, pressing film to stone) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; the transformation from burden to communion feels earned but lacks friction or resistance that would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s motivation—rooted in childhood lullabies—is clear and consistent, and his calm demeanor aligns with his actions. However, interiority remains abstract (“borrowed heartbeat,” “dusky harmony”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Emotion is performed through lyrical description rather than revealed via struggle or flawed decision-making. The character functions more as a symbolic conduit than a psychologically specific individual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s “operatively gentle” trait manifests in concrete micro-choices—her voice “like dew,” her handling of the clipboard—and her internal conflict between burden and hope is embodied, not summarized. However, the chieftains remain archetypal; their softened eyes and exchanged glances lack individuated pressure. The final tear is earned but borders on lyrical convention without deeper contradiction. Her competence slightly overshadows struggle, softening the cost’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amoral philanthropist’s contradictory impulses—profit, power, and secret sentimentality—act simultaneously in scene, most vividly when he releases the egg with “a flicker of tenderness” that “the world would never read as compassion.” His micro-choices (withdrawing the wire, timing the release to the thunder’s lull) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the drought he engineered scars the land even as he preserves an echo. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in embodied detail (“tear that tasted of sand and redemption”). The final renunciation—walking away from the amplified song—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtesan’s motivation—to defy conformity through poetic resonance—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her identity as a “bodily poetic” figure. However, her internal conflict lacks concrete contradiction; she moves with unwavering grace without palpable struggle or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but her micro-choices (tracing threads, releasing echoes) reveal values. Yet the epiphany that the harvest is a symphony feels slightly unearned, arriving more as lyrical assertion than dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selene’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and consistent contradiction—her serenity coexists with the weight of ethical urgency. Her motivation (ethical storytelling) drives micro-choices: arranging dishes, lifting the stick, letting the fire die. The final renunciation (foregoing control over narrative meaning) feels earned, with cost legible in her relinquishment of the puppeteer role. No diagnostic label-speak mars her epiphany; insight arises from concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—her trembling hands, transient rooting, and blushing stillness—but her motivation remains largely declarative rather than tested by meaningful contradiction or choice under pressure. The absence of a second character or external opposition limits the crucible for transformation, though her micro-choices (tying knots, placing the wing) reveal a hierarchy of reverence over permanence. However, the final renunciation lacks a dramatized cost beyond lyrical abstraction; we’re told she feels “the weight of histories never written,” but no tangible forfeiture or altered future is shown. Her consistency as an esoteric realist is clear, yet the stakes of her act remain unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her “technically gentle” touch, “snowmelt ardor,” and self-forgiveness feel specific and earned. Her motivation to preserve forgotten names emerges organically from personal history without therapy-speak. The shift from doubt to resolve is credibly paced through tactile engagement with the rope and cylinder. However, her backstory remains lightly sketched; the emotional cost of past silence is implied but not dramatized with a concrete micro-choice that alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Foresight Hindsight Only’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a profound metaphysical curiosity that intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is vividly embodied—cradling the wafer seal, perceiving spores, feeling “ethereal grit”—avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The final renunciation (leaving the seal on the altar) is earned by her catalytic role in the forest’s renewal, with cost implied in her soaked feet yet dry spirit—a subtle but legible trade-off. However, the character’s paradoxical perception remains more conceptual than emotionally contradictory in scene, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nabu’s frugality and curiosity are consistent motivators, and his micro-choices (measuring grain vs. stars, sketching schematics) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped—his “empirically ironic” stance is stated more than dramatized through simultaneous conflicting impulses. The final act feels earned but lacks visible cost beyond atmospheric shift; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s pacifist scheming is vividly embodied through tactile choices and sensory micro-actions, particularly her placement of the music box and whispered invocation. However, Kovan’s transformation lacks internal contradiction—his shift from grudge to grace occurs without resistance or struggle, flattening emotional realism. The wanderer’s arc is more credible but still streamlined; his epiphany leans on convenient cellular memory rather than earned psychological friction. Motivation is consistent but insufficiently tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlen’s motivation—capturing a runaway dream through breath-synchronized craft—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. His internal contradiction (desire to erase boundaries vs. need for precision) manifests in physical ritual, not summary. The final choice—to guard the dream through continued breathing—feels earned, with cost implied in his rootedness and the orchard’s fragile renewal. No diagnostic label-speak or unmotivated epiphanies mar his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation and interiority are vividly embodied—her feisty resolve, tactile use of tools, and generational yearning feel specific and consistent. Mira’s presence creates genuine relational pressure that shapes Lira’s choices. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: the transition from breach-induced loss to serene renewal lacks friction or contradiction in Lira’s impulses. The final choice is earned, but the cost (loss of guild standing) remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The curator’s bewilderment is embodied through tactile and perceptual reactions rather than diagnostic labels, and his micro-choices—especially pressing the cameo to his palm—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on curiosity over certainty. His internal contradiction (desire for knowledge vs. fear of disorientation) operates simultaneously in key beats. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle; the "simply complicated" trait feels more descriptive than constraining. Still, the final renunciation of linear narrative carries credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selene’s motivation is clear and consistent—her drive to rescue unlearned knowledge stems from her identity as an arcane linguist. Her actions (researching gaps, offering the missing diary page) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over possession, listening over speaking. However, interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we see competence but little struggle or doubt under pressure. The time traveler’s presence adds minimal relational pressure, limiting depth in secondary dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chimera twin discoverer is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—“blissfully aberrant” yet purposeful—but her internal conflict lacks concrete stakes that pressure micro-choices. Her motivation remains abstract (“to recapture scattered verses”) without friction between competing desires or costs that alter tactics. The epiphany about “stories that set them free” feels unearned by prior struggle, leaning into diagnostic label-speak (“trapped freedom… wrapped like rusted chains of light”). While visually compelling, her agency reads more as symbolic conduit than psychologically grounded actor under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as an archivist, and her actions—reweaving the rope, using the seal—are consistent with her “warmly methodical” nature. Her interiority is concrete (“feeling the faint hum… beneath her fingertips”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily from curiosity to resolution without internal friction or hesitation that would deepen her humanity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with ice and stone, but his internal contradiction remains underexplored—his desire for quiet never truly conflicts with another impulse. His actions align with motive, yet the absence of struggle or blind spot makes his success feel inevitable rather than earned. The “ripple-mark skin” and silver lines suggest depth, but no flaw complicates his choices. Final renunciation lacks visible cost beyond atmospheric change.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The custodian’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—is compellingly rooted in stubborn hope, not abstraction. Interiority is vivid (“my heart beating in rhythm with the glass”) and embodied through ritualistic acts.

The final choice feels earned but leans toward monolithic conviction rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s preemptive nostalgia is vividly embodied and consistent, driving his ritualistic actions with emotional specificity. His internal contradiction—grieving imagined futures while seeking identity in memory—is rendered through tactile choices (tracing shadows, trembling quill) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the character remains largely static; his “resolve” at the end feels more like affirmation than earned transformation, limiting the depth of change expected at this tier. The lack of tangible cost to his epiphany (no lost opportunity, tool, or relationship) slightly undermines motivation’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The designer’s interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception and ritualized action, avoiding diagnostic labels. His motivation—to defy hopelessness through art—is dramatized via micro-choices (whispering rhymes, lifting the rag knot) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his emotional arc lacks a visible cost beyond atmospheric shift; the “gravity of hopelessness” lifts too cleanly without tangible sacrifice. The final vow feels earned but leans on lyric assertion rather than concrete renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chronicler’s motivation is consistent and deeply felt, with interiority rendered through precise sensory perception rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—placing the cicada, noting ripples, interpreting silence—are grounded in her role and worldview.

The absence of internal struggle or error makes her epiphany feel earned but untested.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s motivation—to taste silences—is vividly embodied and consistently drives his actions. His claustrophobia and yearning are rendered through sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. The mother’s presence is minimal but functional, serving as emotional anchor without over-explaining. Final choice to return underground with expanded perception feels earned, though the internal contradiction (fear vs. curiosity) could deepen under higher pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices—whispering counter-tones, adjusting gondola speed—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she remains serene throughout without genuine struggle or blind spots. Her emotional state never degrades under pressure, leaning into diagnostic self-awareness (“to catalyze calm”) rather than messy humanity. The storm glass vial externalizes her inner work but doesn’t force hard trade-offs. Still, her actions align tightly with her goal, and the final renunciation (emptying the vial) carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mina’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her role as lore keeper, but interior contradiction and embodied emotional struggle are underdeveloped. The ruby flake guides her choices, yet her internal conflict remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized. She exhibits competence without meaningful vulnerability or flawed decision-making under pressure. The final act feels earned by plot logic but not by deep character causality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The keeper’s motivation—to teach darkness to breathe—is paradoxical yet consistent, embodied through tactile actions (tapping the threshold, burning bridges as reverence). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting in ritualized micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: isolation for the sake of renewal. However, his emotional contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; grief and purpose alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the ring) is earned, with visible cost—permanent severance—but the absence of a second character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s trauma from the pyramid scheme grounds every hesitation and choice, creating a credible interior contradiction between hope and skepticism. Lira functions as both catalyst and mirror, but her "virtuously mischievous" trait remains underexplored in action—more label than lever. The final decision to install the bolt is earned through micro-choices (e.g., rereading glitchy texts, recalling past leverage) that reflect a hierarchy of values: honesty over greed, caution over credulity. However, the manager’s late appearance feels tacked-on; his transformation lacks causal buildup, weakening secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lian’s motivation is clear and rooted in lineage, with micro-choices (turning the crank, placing his ear) revealing a hierarchy of values. However, interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction (“heart beat in cadence with unseen frequencies”) rather than embodied contradiction, and the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle—betrayal is received, not wrestled with. The lack of genuine resistance or flawed missteps undercuts emotional realism. Still, his final renunciation of silence-as-shame for silence-as-wisdom feels earned through tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The knight’s motivation—to capture the shape of possibility—is abstract but embodied through tactile choices: handling the program, tracing glyphs, whispering allegiance. His withdrawn nature manifests in quiet resolve rather than dialogue or interaction, fitting single-POV constraints. However, his internal shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; transformation leans toward epiphany over struggle. The armor melting into moss signals earned stasis with visible cost, satisfying closure under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amelia’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her tactile interaction with dust, button, and files reveals a quiet desperation to redeem neglect through attention. However, her emotional arc leans toward tidy restoration (“broken heart stitching itself back together”) without sufficient friction or contradiction under pressure. The supervisor’s softening feels convenient rather than earned by interpersonal dynamics. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak but lacks the messy irrationality that would make her hope feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s quiet resolve and resourcefulness are consistently embodied through action—salvaging, mapping, transmitting—but her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene. The final choice lacks a visible trade-off or cost tied to her specific flaw; she endures without meaningful friction. Her motivation is clear but not tested by competing impulses under pressure. Still, her understated agency and tactile relationship with objects ground her as more than a symbol.

    The saxophonist’s motivation—to silence a coded prophecy—is clear and consistent, rooted in familial legacy and duty. His interiority is conveyed through embodied perception (“each breath a filament of color”) rather than diagnostic labels.

The final renunciation (choosing silence over sound) is earned but carries minimal felt cost beyond atmospheric melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly embodied through precise actions—prodding soil, arranging seeds, building monuments—that reveal an orderly yet reverent devotion. Her transformation feels earned, with each leaf deciphered deepening her connection to the arbor.

The absence of struggle makes her “orderly soul” feel more aesthetic than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with tools, moss, water, and ember reveals a mind that thinks through making. Her contradiction (seeking order yet drawn to uncertainty) drives every choice, culminating in the earned renunciation of rigid timekeeping for improvisational rhythm. The final micro-choice—placing the compass beside a new waterfall-driven clock—forecloses her old identity with tangible cost: abandoning repair for creation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through rustling ferns, silver dust, and cool spray.

    The alchemist’s motivation—understanding the weight of names—is rooted in childhood memory and embodied through precise, ritualized action. Her internal conflict (between empirical discipline and mystical belief) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to whisper the dragon’s name again—feels earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the “luminous regret” transformed to gratitude. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“redemption was not a single transaction…”) without sufficient contradictory irrationality under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “modest fearlessness” manifests in tactile choices (cradling the tooth, pressing it to stone) and emotional vulnerability to spectral grief. Her motivation deepens organically from curiosity to purpose through listening, not exposition. The final laugh arises from memory and empathy, not convenience, and her renunciation of passive collection for active healing carries quiet cost. However, her internal contradiction remains slightly muted; we see resolve more than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s trauma is vividly embodied, and her motivation—to derive a “mathematics of mercy” from suffering—is compelling and consistent. However, her epiphany arrives with minimal struggle; the transition from pain to insight lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The pewter strap’s transformation feels earned, but her internal shift leans toward diagnostic clarity (“remember the pain, not erase it”) that borders on therapy-speak without sufficient dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices, particularly in the alignment of paintings with the fragment’s glow. Motivation—honoring overlooked histories—is consistent and deepened by childhood memory. However, the final renunciation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional resonance; the “bridge” role feels assumed rather than earned through struggle. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the single-POV execution remains precise and voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “weightless burden” and observational habits feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (e.g., placing the mainspring barrel as lantern, whispering to spirits) reveal a hierarchy of values: listening over fixing, acknowledgment over extraction. The final shift from burden to purpose is earned through cumulative spectral engagement, not epiphany. However, her flaw remains slightly abstract—ghost-seeing functions more as tool than source of internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is consistent, embodied in her frost-tracing and press work, and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal contradiction (preserving order vs. embracing rupture) manifests through micro-choices like pressing the bottle into the ink. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from caution to agency lacks a visible misstep or hesitation that would ground her transformation in flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is richly rendered through poetic perception and embodied sorrow, with micro-choices—like slipping the shard into her pocket—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation (to reimagine civilization) emerges credibly from past failure and present observation. However, her emotional state remains largely static; the “burnished sorrow” is consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of armed rebellion is earned, though the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alder’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his tinkersong wonder, reverence for truthful metal, and urgency to reclaim light feel rooted in lineage and personal ethos. His micro-choices (humming sunrise lullabies, circling the gear) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to craft and honesty. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he moves with near-perfect clarity, missing the friction that would deepen character under pressure. The absence of struggle or blind spot slightly flattens emotional complexity despite strong thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in her identity as a petrichor collector and seeker of inexplicable places—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception rather than diagnostic labels, and her final surrender to wonder feels earned. However, her “sensibly eccentric” trait remains more atmospheric than causally active; it doesn’t produce a visible tradeoff or constrain a key choice with cost. The lack of contradictory impulses in-scene (e.g., fear vs. curiosity) slightly softens the emotional complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars as “chapters,” palms smelling of salt and pine—and her motivation to “scaffold complexity with simplicity” drives tangible choices. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over contradiction; the realization about her childhood self feels earned but borders on tidy. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics aren’t tested. Her perpetual learning is shown through action, not label, yet the absence of genuine struggle (e.g., failed carvings, doubt) softens flaw integration.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in childhood memory and sustained by embodied curiosity—is consistent and specific. Her internal conflict between doubt and wonder manifests through micro-choices (aligning the postcard, waiting for response) rather than abstract rumination. Emotion is rendered through tactile imagery (“tears trace paths,” “umbral tenderness like a shawl”) without diagnostic labels. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the cost of her “lingering winter” is felt but not dramatized as a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in archival justice, and her micro-choices—gathering debris, negotiating with Qadir—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, interior contradiction remains underdeveloped; her “searing reverie” leans toward label-speak without embodied tension between competing impulses. The emotional arc feels earned but lacks the irrationality or hypocrisy that would deepen authenticity. Final resolve reads as steadfast rather than transformed, limiting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s motivation—reviving the town through memory rather than false promises—is consistent and embodied in his rejection of the bottle’s whispers and his meticulous mental reconstruction. His internal conflict between longing and discipline manifests through concrete choices (e.g., recalling names, rejecting easy magic). However, his emotional state remains slightly abstracted; we’re told he feels “quiet pride” but not shown its physical or behavioral texture under pressure. The final renunciation (walking away) is earned, yet the cost—loneliness, labor—feels implied rather than viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Harel’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile engagement with wax, fruit, and language reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in preservation over control. His micro-choices (shaving the cylinder, whispering Sumerian) carry visible cost: he accepts complicity in a recursive fate. The third-grade memory functions not as exposition but as a sensory key that alters his present action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete ritual and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—“to discover the texture of borrowed time”—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her decisive act of surrendering the acorn cap. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions like “furiously tranquil” are rendered through sensory contradiction rather than abstraction. However, her choice lacks visible trade-off: she incurs no loss beyond symbolic gesture, weakening cost legibility. The final planting feels earned but untested by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tester’s “credibly curious” drive is embodied in precise actions—waiting for glue to dry, calibrating sensors—and culminates in a quiet renunciation of noise for listening. His internal contradiction (precision vs. faith in the storm’s voice) resolves through earned stasis, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak mars his interiority; emotions manifest via tactile detail (tightening straps, laying rope aside “like a retired hymn”). Final choice forecloses the old clamor with visible cost: solitude, meticulous labor, and stewardship without acclaim.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cosmic janitor’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—lantern glow as emotional conduit, fingertip tracing as empathic ritual—but motivation leans on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete contradiction. The vow to “honor each fallen ember” feels spiritually resonant yet lacks a competing impulse that would deepen vulnerability into true tension. Final endurance reads as earned stasis, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The recluse’s motivation—to preserve unspoken weight—is consistent and embodied through his ritualized interaction with the box, yet his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; his choice feels more like serene acceptance than a fraught renunciation. His “tranquilly perceptive” trait informs observation but not decisive action under pressure. The final endurance is credible but leans toward epiphany over struggle. No diagnostic label-speak mars interiority, though emotional complexity remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to understand the texture of time—is consistent and embodied through tactile, sensory engagement with objects. Her micro-choices (searching ads, placing the urn fragment) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on recollection over utility. However, interior contradiction is muted; her drive lacks friction against competing impulses or self-doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The epiphany feels earned but not hard-won through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation—to discover beauty in the incomplete—is consistent and thematically resonant, but his interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His actions (placing the feather, writing verses) align with his traits but lack tangible cost or struggle. The character reads more as a vessel for theme than a fully realized individual with flawed agency. No meaningful renunciation or endurance forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—fostering interspecies respect—is consistent and embodied through her systematic orchard work, diary-keeping, and copper-wrapping ritual. Her internal contradiction (accepting death while defying it through legacy) is subtly rendered without diagnostic label-speak. The final endurance (“standing tall” despite the deadline) reads as earned stasis with visible cost: six months of labor under mortal pressure. However, her emotional arc lacks a pivotal micro-choice that forces a trade-off; she remains unchallenged in her resolve, flattening interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied curiosity and defiance, but his “luminous skeptic” label occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“academically rebellious nature”) that flattens contradiction. His micro-choices—spreading amber, whispering to the tower—reveal values credibly, yet the emotional arc lacks friction between competing impulses; awe and inquiry coexist too harmoniously. The final renunciation of worship for inquiry feels earned but costless—no path is truly foreclosed. A sharper internal struggle would elevate this beyond thematic illustration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s motivation—fertilizing a battlefield-turned-garden via ancestral ritual—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (listening to bird calls, whispering glyphs). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains rooted in sensory action (“his tongue shaping sounds that no living ear had heard”). However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves from duty to quiet fulfillment without internal friction or cost beyond implied ancestral weight. The final smile feels earned but slightly smoothed of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rook’s motivation—translating distance into closeness—is rooted in his past as a body-finder and reinforced by tactile memory, not exposition. His interiority is concrete: ash-dusted muzzle, humming leaf, prism-refracted hues. Yet his final choice (sealing the leaf back) lacks visible cost beyond emotional resonance; no path is foreclosed, only affirmed. The absence of contradictory impulses or struggle undercuts full character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile interactions with the compass and charcoal, revealing contradictory impulses—grief versus hope, paralysis versus exploration. Their motivation stems from a deeply personal ritual, not abstract longing, and their final resolve emerges credibly from sensory-triggered memory. However, the shift from confusion to “quiet resolve” leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-resistance; the emotional arc is compelling but borders on tidy. The pariah status is evocative but under-pressurized as a lived identity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysander’s motivation—amending a betrayal through playful secrecy—is vividly rooted in his identity as both thief and apprentice of wonder. His interiority is embodied (“heart beating in rhythm with the sighing wind”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The “sacredly playful” trait informs micro-choices (swapping pieces, breath on the sundial) with emotional stakes, though the final epiphany leans slightly abstract. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; his solitary arc earns its closure through consistent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her crisis-actor past informs her present resolve without diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation (“historian of small gestures”) emerges credibly from trauma and profession, driving micro-choices like spelling words in dust. The “benevolently ruthless” trait manifests in action (walking patterns that summon truth) with visible cost: bearing the weight of erased lives. However, the lack of interpersonal pressure (she’s alone) limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—to understand the shape of home—is deeply personal and consistently embodied through tactile interactions with the stone and feather. Her buried talents evolve credibly from dismissed sketches to a resonant creative force, and her final choice to place the stone back on the pedestal enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: she relinquishes direct access to memory but gains alignment with her talent. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory perception (pine resin, rain arches) rather than abstraction. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene—her path is singularly focused—prevents full 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “fidgets productively,” his “calm rage,” and tactile interactions with threads and stones reveal a psyche under pressure. His flaw (premature pawn sacrifice) directly caused exile, and his final act of letting go feels earned through micro-choices (untangling threads, arranging stones). However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; guilt dissolves cleanly without lingering contradiction, missing full psychological friction. The 9+ gate fails due to insufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—forgiveness through refracted truth—is consistent and embodied in her actions (painting, poetry), but her internal contradiction lacks depth; she shifts from defiance to calm without sufficient friction. The “innocently mischievous” trait is stated but not tested under pressure. Her final choice feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her doubt, resolve, and transformation are rendered through tactile sensations (the charm’s warmth, the acid mist’s bite) rather than abstract labels. Her micro-choices—tracing pockmarks, aligning the charm, whispering the first line—are consistent with her motivation to forge meaning from brokenness. However, her emotional shift from uncertainty to quiet confidence lacks a contradictory impulse acting simultaneously; it leans toward a tidy arc. The final smile reads earned but slightly uninflected by lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The painter’s motivation—seeking a “temporary eternity”—is consistent and emotionally grounded, driving every key choice. Interiority is richly embodied through tactile details (trembling fingers, pigment comparisons), though the emotional arc leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction. The final renunciation isn’t a refusal but an embrace, which works as Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels more aesthetic than visceral. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; the single-POV focus remains disciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—tears like dew, heartbeats syncing with the world—but her motivation lacks contradictory impulses or tangible struggle. Her “screaming tenderness” reads as emotional assertion rather than dramatized conflict. No visible cost accrues from her choices; the fisherman’s arrival feels like affirmation, not consequence. Final renunciation or endurance is absent, undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The patchwork navigator’s motivation—to map the geography of loss—is vividly embodied through her ritualized actions and tactile relationship with the censer foot. Her internal contradiction (longing vs. duty) simmers beneath precise, sensory-driven choices, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the transition from grief to “steady acceptance” feels swift given the story’s brevity. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but her solitude is effectively leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s involuntary truthfulness creates credible internal tension, and her rationality contrasts effectively with the mythic setting. Her motivation—to transform private grief into shared spectacle—is dramatized through concrete action (hiding the eye) and a micro-choice (confronting smugglers). However, her emotional state remains slightly abstracted (“old sorrow,” “fractured grace”) rather than fully embodied under storm-pressure. The final renunciation of secrecy is earned, though the cost—greed eclipsed, silence—feels conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlowe’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling fingers, the boutonnière “pulsing” against his chest—and his motivation (to decode a silent plea) feels consistent and emotionally urgent. His final act of alignment with the tide’s lull is a credible renunciation that forecloses anonymity for the stranger, carrying visible emotional cost. However, his eccentricity leans slightly on archetype (“frayed coat,” “alpine winds”) without deeper contradiction or flaw that complicates his choice. The epiphany arrives smoothly but lacks internal resistance that would make it feel earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile perception and poetic restraint, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His motivation—rooted in a promise to a dying explorer—feels consistent and emotionally grounded. However, the final choice lacks visible cost or contradiction; his transformation from loneliness to purpose occurs without struggle or sacrifice, undermining emotional credibility. The absence of a tangible trade-off weakens the stakes despite lyrical embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The queen’s internal conflict—between duty and curiosity—is evoked through lyrical interiority, but her transformation lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure. Emotions are embodied poetically (“crown heavy with forgotten vows”) yet verge on abstraction during pivotal moments. The final decision feels more epiphanic than earned through struggle. Her flaw (disenchantment) resolves too cleanly without visible cost beyond atmospheric change.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pocket-sun alchemist shows interiority through concrete action (adjusting lenses, observing the horizon) and embodies emotion via tactile ritual, but motivation leans on lyrical abstraction (“capture the density of presence”) without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle. The group functions more as chorus than crucible—relationships lack individuated pressure or status shifts. Final resolve feels collective rather than earned through personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, sap-stained bark, the ache of watching his younger self—and his motivation (to trap memory in narrative) is consistent and intensified by pressure. His “jealousy of past selves” functions as both flaw and method, driving micro-choices like writing “furiously” after the dream. However, the internal conflict leans slightly toward lyrical summary (“chaotic visions,” “feral nostalgia”) rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in-scene. The renunciation of the grave-as-endpoint is earned, with visible cost: the dissolution of innocence, ambitions turned to ash.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile and emotional perception, grounded in her anosmia and reverence for objects. Her motivation—to unveil ordinary miracles—drives micro-choices (aligning the screw with the pendulum, whispering stories) that feel consistent and embodied. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward epiphany without resistance or doubt. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but an affirmation, which limits felt cost despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation—to transform scars into healing stories—is vividly embodied and consistent, with each scar a literalized rune of failure. Her internal conflict between burden and release manifests in tactile choices: dipping the quill, whispering the rhyme, releasing breath. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle; the scars lift “not erased but transformed” with minimal resistance, softening the cost. The final luminous runes feel earned by atmosphere more than by dramatized psychological labor.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The exorcist’s motivation—delivering an apology to Mara—is clear and emotionally grounded, with interiority rendered through sensory metaphors rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (gossip as weapon vs. healing tool) manifest in embodied choices, like arranging torn scores into a spiral. However, the lack of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible depth, and her emotional shift leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete psychological friction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire to “unravel cosmic illusions,” yet her interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are conveyed through lyrical metaphor (“aching peace”) rather than sensory or physiological specificity, weakening emotional credibility. Her choices—placing the dictionary on the crystal, stepping onto the map—are decisive but lack micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The character functions more as a vessel for concept than a flawed individual with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shepherd’s interiority is vividly embodied—his breath, pulse, and tactile responses to gear and tide feel specific and consistent. His motivation (to measure the horizon as a paradox of time) intensifies through micro-choices: squinting, counting backward, whispering numbers. However, his epiphany about clocks measuring “intervals between breaths” leans slightly toward diagnostic abstraction without sufficient prior contradiction in action. Still, his final renunciation—walking away after syncing with the station’s rhythm—feels earned through sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied through spatial perception and the recurring motif of “letting go,” avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Their motivation—understanding the physics of release—is credibly tied to their profession and personal epiphany, though the emotional arc leans slightly toward abstraction in its final reflection. The laser button functions as both tool and psychological anchor, grounding abstract yearning in concrete action. However, the workers remain underdeveloped “familiar strangers,” limiting relational pressure despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her compulsive gambling heritage versus academic rigor—but her emotional response to her mother’s death remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized. The micro-choice to place the coin feels motivated, yet the grief lacks specific behavioral manifestation beyond atmospheric melancholy. Her “theoretically rebellious” trait is stated more than enacted under pressure. The final theorem-writing shows credible endurance, but the cost of her journey isn’t fully felt in the body or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“concrete itself recognized a new cadence”) and micro-choices (answering wrong numbers, recording grief onto the disc). Her motivation—to “teach endings how to begin”—is consistent and deepened by her estrangement, though the shift from isolation to communion feels slightly under-pressured in causal terms. Lena’s presence functions more as catalyst than crucible, limiting relational stakes. The final step out of the booth reads as earned stasis with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s motivation—to preserve “the weight of small moments”—is consistent and embodied through tactile rituals (handling the locket, writing with walnut ink), but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he acts with serene certainty throughout. His micro-choices (e.g., slipping the locket onto his wrist, beginning to write) reveal devotion but no struggle or trade-off that risks his purpose. The child’s photo evokes emotion, yet the archivist never wavers, undercutting dramatic tension expected at this tier. A flaw like doubt, fatigue, or competing duty would have elevated this to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s “desperately jocular” trait manifests in embodied action—joking while plotting—and her micro-choices (sending absurd invitations, assembling misfits) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on connection over control. Her motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly toward catalyzing empathy, though the final renunciation lacks visible personal cost; the story implies altruism without dramatizing sacrifice. Interiority avoids therapy-speak but leans slightly abstract in moments like “cure for loneliness,” risking label-only emotion. Still, her contradictions feel human, and her competence is balanced by reliance on rumor and ivy-puzzles.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation is deeply rooted in her unique physiology and emotional yearning, compellingly dramatized through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., trusting the ring’s vibration over doubt). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through embodied sensation—sorrow “as clearly as a spoken word.” The final renunciation isn’t of a path but of external mapping in favor of inner cartography, foreclosing old identity with quiet cost. No secondary characters dilute focus, preserving single-POV intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied paradox (“confidently uncertain”) and consistent emotional texture, but their motivation leans on abstract stakes rather than concrete, escalating choices with visible cost. The pen functions more as symbol than crucible for decision. A credible endurance emerges at closure, yet the absence of a second character or external pressure limits relational depth. The flaw—past error—is compelling but resolved through lyrical reconfiguration rather than dramatized renunciation with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poignant desire to give voice to silence for the forgotten. His internal contradiction—joyful sorrow—feels embodied and specific, not abstract. However, his charisma remains largely asserted rather than demonstrated through micro-choices with visible cost. Lira’s late arrival lacks sufficient interiority or struggle to fully earn her inheritance of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arsonist’s interiority is richly embodied—his “volcanic tenderness” and analytical intuition manifest in tactile choices (tracing glyphs, pressing tapestry). His contradictory impulses (destruction vs. preservation) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The vandalized self-portrait forces a reckoning that feels earned, with visible cost: the blackened eyes mirror his past sins. Final mural of rebirth shows credible endurance without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—to breathe life into a shared dream—is embodied through her drumming, not stated abstractly, and her quiet rebellion manifests in tactile action (tapping crystal leaves, bronze stones). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; sorrow and hope emerge through sensory perception (“auroral in hue,” “whispered through the ripples”). However, the lack of on-page human characters limits relational crucible or status dynamics, capping full complexity. The final renunciation isn’t of escape but transformation—earned and specific—but lacks a visible personal cost beyond implied emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Milo’s motivation is clear and consistent—his belief in whispers over shouts drives every action—but his interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The contradiction between “calculated spontaneity” and ritualistic behavior isn’t dramatized through simultaneous impulses, only stated. His final validation feels earned, yet the emotional cost is conceptual rather than visceral. The key micro-choice (whispering into the coin) aligns with motive but lacks tangible personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    The guardian lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; its “motivation” is stated but never tested under pressure. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values—actions are ritualistic, not consequential. The lone fisherman appears too late to function as a crucible. Final “smile” feels unearned because no prior cost or resistance shaped it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—planting “forests of second thoughts”—is vividly embodied through her chess coaching and synchronized displays, and her gift for hearing unspoken words informs consistent action. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; she faces no meaningful resistance or doubt that tests her conviction. The magnetic grotto symbolizes her rebellion but doesn’t force a micro-choice with visible cost. Her endurance is credible but lacks the friction that would make her quiet revolution feel earned rather than ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—protecting the harbor versus breaking free—is vividly embodied and drives her climactic choice. Her “combative tenderness” feels specific, not diagnostic, and her micro-choices (whispering the hymn, placing the scrimshaw) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of the scrimshaw forecloses her old conflict with visible emotional cost. However, the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and morally nuanced, with micro-choices (whittling as resistance) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her blank affect contrasts with purposeful action, embodying grief under a joy mandate without therapy-speak. However, her motivation borders on abstract (“cultivate lightness”) without deeper personal history to ground the moral ambiguity in lived contradiction. The final smile lacks sufficient prior friction to fully earn its charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cloud-shadow poet’s motivation is aesthetically driven and consistent, with embodied emotion (“tremor of certainty ripple through his ribs”) and micro-choices (paraphrasing the chant, stepping forward). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped—his doubts are named but not dramatized in tension with his dreams. The character remains more archetype than individual, lacking flaws that complicate action. His final act feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selene’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“perceived the world through the cadence of shadows and the whisper of metal”) and consistent contradictions—her “innocently cunning” bartering reveals both yearning and agency. Her flaw (colorblindness) directly shapes her method and emotional arc, culminating in an Earned Stasis that accepts imperfection as luminous. However, the glassblower’s minimal presence limits relational crucible depth, and Selene’s epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“the quest to find beauty in imperfection was itself a gentle bargain”), though it’s anchored in action. The final micro-choice—arranging cereus to coax the reed—demonstrates credible endurance with visible cost: she trades certainty for fragile, bartered revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bell ringer’s interiority is vividly embodied (“powerfully gentle,” “texture of connection”), and their micro-choices—tapping chimes, aligning the lamp—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on curiosity over spectacle. However, motivation leans slightly abstract; the desire for “kinship” lacks friction or contradiction that would deepen character complexity under pressure. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant. The final renunciation of grandiose visions feels earned but borders on tidy without a stronger counter-impulse dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mourning jeweler’s interiority is vividly embodied—copper-stained fingers, grief as a tactile weight—and her motivation to “teach withering to bloom” emerges organically from despair. Her micro-choices (tracing the stencil, folding cranes) reveal a hierarchy of values: renewal over resignation. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory struggle; the shift from desolation to keeper of light feels earned but compressed. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, preserving emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartomancer’s motivation—mapping cultural patterns through reverse engineering the crash—is vividly embodied in her tactile engagement with tape, cards, and journal. Her “steadily curious” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., aligning tape with subway veins, kneeling to confide) that reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over profit. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through sensory detail (“resistance of memory,” “weight of inherited mystery”). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her curiosity never visibly wars with doubt or fear, softening the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s motivation—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is consistent and embodied through his erratic gait and sensory engagement with the archive. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through physical action (e.g., trembling hands, deliberate missteps). The final transformation feels earned because his “steadily unpredictable” trait directly enables access to the pagoda’s secrets. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle, softening the cost of purification.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dusk noticer’s interiority is vivid and consistent, grounded in sensory perception and quiet yearning. His micro-choices—lifting the stone, aligning it with footage—are motivated by a deep-seated desire to preserve hope, and his emotional arc moves credibly from regret to gratitude. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; his resolve feels steady rather than fraught. The absence of genuine struggle or blind spots prevents full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling convictions, tactile rituals, and breath-synchronized color shifts reveal a character under pressure. Her motivation (balancing self-respect and compassion) drives concrete micro-choices: returning the tail tip, arranging debris, shedding judgments. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“balance is not a static point but a river”) that edges into label-speak near closure, softening the raw contradiction expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation as a “closure seeker” is vividly embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., tracing coffee rings, aligning the hourglass), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Internal contradiction emerges in their compulsion to reopen wounds while seeking resolution—a tension made concrete in scar-reading rituals. However, the telepathic plant interaction borders on unearned epiphany without sufficient prior groundwork for this specific ability, slightly weakening causal motivation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal gazer’s motivation—to find where unused love is stored—is compelling and consistent, driving her tactile engagement with the film strip and letters. Her interiority is richly embodied (“coat humming with the echo of the song,” “heart that never learned to speak”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her transformation lacks a visible cost: the “empty chambers” fill without resistance or sacrifice, making the emotional payoff feel unearned under causal scrutiny. A renunciation or loss would have grounded her epiphany in credible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dreamer’s motivation—to free trapped creativity—is consistent but abstract, lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“unvoiced poems surge through his veins”) rather than concrete, character-specific perception. His actions align with motive, yet the absence of struggle or flawed decision-making flattens agency. The final renunciation feels earned thematically but not causally rooted in prior behavioral evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guard’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing and contradiction—dreamless yet stirred, stern yet softening—but his motivation lacks friction or cost that compels higher-stakes choices. His actions align with stated purpose, yet no meaningful trade-off or renunciation occurs; the “cultivation” proceeds without resistance. The final warmth feels earned emotionally but not causally, as no prior beat forces a sacrifice that makes it legible as cost. A compelling figure, but his arc leans toward revelation over reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philosopher’s motivation—to reclaim his inner wilderness—is clearly rooted in the awakening of the sixth sense and intensifies through tactile engagement with the gear and forest. However, interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction; emotional states are described (“rustled shut,” “hummed in his veins”) without visceral friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. His final realization feels earned thematically but lacks micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The character reads as a vessel for metaphor rather than a flawed individual with blind spots that drive inevitable mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation—reclaiming unused courage after her dog’s leash breaks—is clear and emotionally grounded, with consistent interiority shaped by loss and hope. Her micro-choices (clutching the ticket, stepping into the cave) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward courage without resistance or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of struggle makes her epiphany feel slightly unearned despite lyrical buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bellhop’s silent endurance and the guests’ internal conflict are rendered with embodied restraint, avoiding diagnostic labels. Motivation (“to understand the cost of safety”) is clear and dramatized through their hesitation and observation. However, the guests remain a collective blur—individual contradictions or micro-choices are absent, weakening interiority. The bellhop’s final nod feels earned but leans on archetype over individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The diminutive titan’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in regal duty rather than personal ambition. His micro-choices—pressing the ink pellet, reaching for the crown—are charged with consequence, and his quiet pride at the end feels earned. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he operates with near-perfect competence, lacking a visible blind spot or struggle that would deepen his humanity. The absence of internal conflict weakens emotional complexity despite strong embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara and Eli’s motivations are rooted in ecological grief and scientific curiosity, rendered through embodied ritual (tapping) and the torn atlas. Their interiority avoids diagnostic labels—Mara’s “periodically eternal” mind is shown via sensory recall, not explained. The relationship functions as a quiet crucible: shared focus deepens their bond without melodrama. However, Eli’s character remains slightly underdifferentiated; his agency peaks only in the climax tap.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and embodied emotion, particularly in her tactile engagement with the opera glasses and stone hum. However, her motivation lacks friction—her “awkward confidence” functions more as a label than a lived contradiction that shapes costly choices. The absence of competing impulses or genuine struggle undercuts emotional realism; her epiphany arrives without resistance or misstep. While her final stance feels earned tonally, it lacks the causal scaffolding of prior flawed decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Anara’s motivation—to evolve tradition with insurgent intent—is embodied through micro-choices: tending the bath while communing with moss, sacrificing memory, decoding glyphs. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile communion with ferns and steam. The final renunciation (youthful lullabies) carries visible cost and aligns with her arc. Contradictory impulses—reverence vs rebellion—act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—panic frozen via somatic markers, grief anchored in tactile memory—but her motivation leans slightly abstract. The “quietly talented gait” and breath-rhythm choices show micro-agency, yet the central trauma lacks a contradictory impulse that actively resists healing. Her endurance feels earned, but the renunciation of despair isn’t pressured by an opposing desire; it’s more acceptance than struggle. Still, the photograph-handling and whispered vow reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, crestfallen posture, and tactile engagement with the tarot cards reveal a consistent, wounded artist. His motivation (to redesign his approach to capturing souls) intensifies organically through interaction with the setting and objects. The final choice—to embrace fragmentation as canvas—is earned by his prior doubt and symbolic descent. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“fragmented reality he had feared was not a curse but a canvas”) without sufficient micro-choices dramatizing the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “serene anger,” albino sensitivity, and tactile interaction with the ink reveal a coherent psyche under pressure. His motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to purpose, and his final declaration feels earned. However, the transition from “anger” to “purpose” lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path; it’s stated rather than dramatized. The drone functions as extension of self, not a true second character, so relationship dynamics aren’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s interior conflict—liberation versus peace—is embodied in tactile choices (slipping the letter, watching snowflakes) rather than abstract introspection. Her motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses personal safety. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized resolve; the “bravely conflicted” label occasionally supersedes granular contradiction in peak beats. The cost—risk of frozen preservation—is felt but not viscerally dramatized beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s pacifism and inherited skill create a compelling internal contradiction, but her choices lack tangible cost or struggle—she sheathes her blade effortlessly, and no real pressure tests her resolve. The boy with the compass is a functional prop, not a crucible. Her “senselessly perceptive” trait remains ornamental, never constraining action or producing error.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fisher’s motivation—longing for the goddess’s echo—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (clutching the spike, tracing lullabies with his feet). However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; his “cool-headed” demeanor lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses. The final renunciation (“to catch… was not to trap it, but to set it free”) feels earned but borders on epiphanic without prior struggle. His emotional arc remains lyrical rather than psychologically layered.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is rooted in generational legacy and intellectual rigor, embodied through her tactile relationship with the pen nib and her application of proof by contradiction. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing itself through perception (“telescope pipe hummed… like newspaper pages in a storm”) and micro-choices (inserting the nib, whispering a promise). The final handoff to the journalist crystallizes her stance: truth requires method, not just exposure. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized resolve—her “grin” and “solemn playfulness” lack friction from tangible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s guilt-driven motivation is consistent and embodied through tactile rituals—stitching amber, tracing letters—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves steadily toward resolution without hesitation or competing desires that would deepen psychological realism. Her emotional arc feels earned yet slightly streamlined, avoiding the messy irrationality expected under high stress.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation—to discover meaning in the mess—is embodied through tactile, iterative actions (drawing spirals, whispering to the tile) rather than abstract yearning. Her socially perceptive trait manifests in noticing echoes as fragmented conversations, but this insight isn’t tested under pressure or shown to constrain choices with cost. The internal contradiction between unease and curiosity drives micro-choices, yet the epiphany about “unlearning” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“shedding the weight of assumptions that muted curiosity”) without fully dramatizing prior misbelief. Final renunciation is credible but lacks a visible trade-off beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gentle radical’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“air still tasted of ash,” “warm coldness”), and his motivation—to cradle empathy in arms of steel—is consistent and intensifies toward the climax. However, his retrocognitive state functions more as atmospheric texture than a source of contradictory impulses or flawed decision-making; his choices feel ordained rather than wrestled from internal conflict. The final renunciation of nostalgia is earned, but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized. His emotional arc lacks irrationality or hypocrisy, trending toward idealized resolve over human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ghost’s motivation—longing for one final performance—is consistent and emotionally legible, but his interiority leans on poetic abstraction (“colors that hummed in the hush of abandoned applause”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The shopkeeper’s arrival introduces a second character whose emotional shift feels earned, yet her role serves more as a vessel for resolution than a crucible of relationship-driven stakes. The ghost’s renunciation at the end reads as Earned Stasis, though the cost is atmospheric rather than visceral. Interior conflict remains lyrical but lacks the grit of simultaneous, clashing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her skepticism and affection coexist in tactile choices (e.g., tracing geode fractures with light). Her motivation intensifies credibly from doubt to purpose, and the final whisper of shared thought feels earned by her somatic experimentation. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“somatic markers pulse like tiny drums”) without deeper contradiction or cost in the moment. The closure shows Charged Poise but lacks a visible sacrifice that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The map maker’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile ritual and micro-choices (e.g., whispering the storm’s name, releasing the final droplet), revealing a coherent interiority rooted in service to silence. Her epiphany—“to amplify the silence that already lived within them”—feels earned by prior action, not declared. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward fulfillment without internal resistance or misstep. This absence of struggle slightly softens the cost of her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—spinning prophecy into possibility—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (button cataloging, sand-turning). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through micro-choices like whispering to the jar. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle; the “quietly inspired” refrain borders on assertion rather than earned transformation. The final bridge-walk feels resonant but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The burned spy’s interiority is evocative but leans on abstract labels like “prudently daring” and “unused courage” without sufficient embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His guilt over past orders is stated rather than dramatized through present action, weakening motivation. The final act of drinking amber liquid and entering the pass feels earned emotionally but lacks concrete trade-offs that would ground his transformation. Still, his tactile interaction with the pillbox and snow codes reveals consistent character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and symbolic action, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His motivation—to distill the river’s memory—feels personal and consistent, rooted in maternal legacy and regret. However, his choices lack tangible stakes or irreversible cost; the “stitch” remains metaphorical, never forcing a concrete sacrifice. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, breath-synced movements, and micro-choices (e.g., whispering a benediction) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her motivation to understand resistance to change drives tangible action, not passive observation. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized serenity without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle under pressure. The resolution feels earned but borders on unearned epiphany due to minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied (“protected vulnerability,” “wistfully pragmatic care”), and her micro-choices—using the bitting gauge tooth, waiting for the petal drop—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. However, her motivation lacks friction; the absence of internal contradiction or tangible cost weakens emotional credibility. The final renunciation feels serene rather than earned through struggle. This limits the depth of character transformation expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to translate isolation into independence—is consistent and embodied through her handling of the sundial and interaction with the library. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward coexistence without meaningful resistance or struggle. The sky-whale functions more as a symbol than a crucible for relationship-based pressure. Her transformation feels earned but leans on epiphany over dramatized micro-choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a ghostwriter seeking connection. Her interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into abstraction (“thread that connects all things”) without sufficient embodied contradiction. The final choice—to place the petal and whisper the letter—feels earned by prior longing, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. Emotional embodiment leans heavily on metaphor over physical sensation, slightly muting authenticity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete actions—plotting pulses, feeding charts into algorithms—and her “cautiously hopeful” stance shapes tactical choices with visible cost (e.g., risking campus news disruption). Her motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters emerges from embodied memory of legend, not exposition. However, the dean’s sudden shift feels under-pressured by Mara’s interference; their relationship lacks reciprocal friction. The students’ passive reception of subsonic unity borders on implausible consensus without individualized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The explorer’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” spirit create credible internal tension, embodied in physical reactions (“lungs protested,” “breath tighten”) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation—to recover a lost key tied to memory—is consistent and deepens through micro-choices (stepping forward despite fear). However, the epiphany about “rebellion against forgetting” arrives with slight over-articulation, bordering on thematic summarization rather than fully dramatized insight. The final renunciation of isolation—vowing to share the passage—is earned but lacks a visible interpersonal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her face blindness isn’t a gimmick but shapes perception, method, and emotional risk. Her micro-choices (attaching the ribbon, pressing the brush harder) reveal a hierarchy of values: empathy over sight, memory over evidence. The dormant empathy arc feels earned through tactile engagement, not diagnosis. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior friction between her rigor and compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—“nervously confident”—is embodied through tactile details (“trembling fingertips,” “spongey dread”) and micro-choices (descending the ladder, rallying the crew). Her motivation to honor her ancestor is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses flight. However, the ancestor’s backstory remains abstracted rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the emotional lineage. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, preserving authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fiddler’s motivation—forgiveness for the vanished hitchhiker—is consistent and emotionally charged, but his interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. His micro-choices (trekking, playing, exposing the plate) align with his goal yet lack friction or competing impulses. The final vow feels earned thematically but not through prior psychological struggle. “Luminous disbelief” recurs as a label more than an evolving emotional state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his calm rooted in witnessing his father’s violence dissolve into irrelevance. His micro-choices (placing foreign notes as boundaries, dissuading Maya) reveal a hierarchy of values: safety over unbounded freedom. The final pocketing of the euro bill crystallizes his transformation from passive observer to purposeful mapper. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; it’s more sequential reflection than active tension.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied emotion (“weight settle in her chest,” “midnight solace seep into her bones”), and her motivation—to decode temple inscriptions through shared burdens—is consistent. However, her transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her epiphany feels lyrical but unearned by internal struggle. The final choice to share the burden is resonant but not forged through tangible resistance or cost within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The druid’s motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks truth beneath reflection—and her actions align with her guarded yet purposeful nature. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; she moves from resolve to resolution without palpable struggle or competing impulses in-scene. The final choice feels earned but not wrestled with, missing the emotional friction that would elevate it beyond serene competence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The visionary’s motivation—“to find the intersection of dreams”—is clear and intensifies credibly, yet her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; she moves with near-omniscient certainty. Emotions like “anxious elation” are labeled more than embodied, and her choices face no meaningful resistance or trade-off. The final resolve feels earned by mythic logic but not by psychological struggle. Her flawlessness under pressure flattens interiority despite lush description.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maelia’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “fiercely gentle” speech contrasts with her “storm of purpose,” and her micro-choices (pressing ash into roots, placing the card in the hollow) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her motivation leans slightly toward abstract longing (“patch holes in her soul”) without enough contradictory impulses acting *simultaneously* in scene. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a tangible, on-page sacrifice beyond emotional transmutation. Still, her flaws drive action, and the absence of diagnostic self-awareness preserves authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—“confidently uncertain,” wrestling with shame while seeking purpose—but the emotional arc leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“insulating emotionally with facts”) that borders on label-speak. Micro-choices (wrapping the cloth, examining relics) reveal values under pressure, yet the transformation feels more lyrical than causally earned. The roadie-to-appraiser shift informs worldview but lacks on-page friction beyond reflection. Still, the voice remains specific and the cost of public failure lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—understanding the “physics of transition”—is consistent and rooted in her methodical nature, yet her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from haunted ambition to serene purpose without friction or misstep. Her kindness and methodology are shown through tactile actions (tracing glyphs, planting the seed), but emotional embodiment remains abstract (“felt the distance close”) rather than visceral. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, though this fits scope. Her final renunciation of solitary study is earned, but the cost feels conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile interactions with the creel, key, and books; his contradiction—guarding fluid identities while bound in bronze gears—drives micro-choices like forging a memory-key and opening blank volumes. His emotional arc feels earned, not diagnostic, though his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The absence of secondary characters limits relational crucible but fits scope. Final renunciation (letting his own identity migrate) carries quiet cost: softening gears, relinquishing static control.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to dissolve walls between hearts—is compelling but remains abstract; her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene. Interiority leans poetic over embodied, especially during the climax (“felt the walls... melt”). The final choice feels earned thematically but not through prior micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation from inspector to “keeper of light” is resonant but slightly unmoored from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—tape on coat and bellows, river as confessor—but “daringly methodical” feels more decorative than causally active. Motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and consistent, yet the final act lacks a tangible trade-off or foreclosed path beyond lyrical endurance. Emotional contradiction is present (longing vs. fear), but diagnostic phrasing (“truth-seeking river chronicler”) slightly undermines immediacy. The character reads as specific, not archetypal, and the patched accordion functions as both tool and emotional proxy.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The veiled dreamer remains enigmatic rather than fully individuated; her actions serve the plot but lack interior contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The narrator’s motivation is consistent but expressed through abstract emotional labels (“cautious exuberance”) rather than embodied, conflicting impulses under pressure. Both characters function more as archetypes than individuals with specific blind spots or flawed cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—weighing a dream against an empire—is compelling and rooted in personal grief (“mulberry ache”), but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she leans steadily toward hope without credible counterpull. Her telepathic bond with vines feels more like a narrative device than a flaw or struggle. The final choice is earned, yet the emotional cost remains abstract rather than embodied in a decisive renunciation. Still, her micro-choices (aligning violin with coffee rings, weaving dissent) reveal a hierarchy of values with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—preserving light before oblivion—is consistent and emotionally resonant, grounded in her dual role as beautician mortician. Her interiority is rendered through embodied perception (“feeling each vibration as a pulse in her own palm”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she acts with unwavering purpose, missing the friction that would deepen character complexity. The final renunciation (leaving the chip as a beacon) is credible but not earned through struggle—it arrives as serene certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her climbing, pruning, and ritual with the hairpin reveal a psyche shaped by betrayal and care. Her “kindly decisive” nature manifests in micro-choices (e.g., using the hairpin as a compass during storms) that carry visible cost. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward earned epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting *simultaneously* in scene; forgiveness reads as resolved rather than actively contested in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “sincerely insincere” duality is embodied in her actions and internal contradictions, especially when she pretends to shrug off guilt while internally tallying wind whispers. Her micro-choices—handling the mirror shard, unhooking the decree—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on protecting vulnerability. However, the magistrate remains underdeveloped as a pressure source; his transformation feels narrated rather than dramatized through reciprocal interaction. This limits the relational crucible despite strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her reverse aging isn’t just a trait but a lived paradox that shapes her choices, especially the climactic renunciation of immediate revelation. Her micro-choices (placing the stone, withholding perception) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: sacrificing certainty for wisdom. The final smile feels earned, not epiphanic, arising from sustained struggle rather than sudden insight. No diagnostic label-speak mars her emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harmonic stone skimmer’s interiority is vividly embodied—her reverence, stillness, and sensory attunement feel character-specific rather than archetypal. Her micro-choices (waiting, lifting the arrowhead, bowing) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on listening over action. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves seamlessly from observation to resolution without friction or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. This smoothness prevents full 9+ eligibility despite strong voice and motive consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selric’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied doubt and quiet yearning, avoiding diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—unstrapping the spellbook, stepping onto mist—are consistent with his motivation to seek sacred simplicity. The final renunciation of external validation feels earned, though the absence of interpersonal pressure slightly limits relational depth. His flaw (self-doubt rooted in perceived inadequacy) directly enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eli’s motivation—to discover the color of sound—is deeply personal, consistent, and embodied through tactile choices (e.g., slipping the key tag into his pocket, stepping onto the gangway). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion is filtered through sensory perception (“flame whispered in a tone he called meteor hush”). The vow functions as both flaw and compass, driving every action without artificial balance. Final renunciation isn’t needed—his endurance crystallizes into purpose, with cost felt in solitude and the weight of luminous responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation—to “wavelength align with purpose”—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the coins and the static bursts, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His internal contradiction (enthusiasm vs. doubt) operates simultaneously in scene, especially during the decoding sequence. The final choice—turning the last coin—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: accepting purpose as frequency, not destination. However, his emotional progression leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over grounded struggle, limiting full character-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—to name nameless fears—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the crystals and rooted in personal grief, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (whispering names, lifting the atlas page) reveal a hierarchy of values: redemption over mourning. Internal conflict simmers between her reaper duty and human longing, though the sailor’s memory remains too spectral to fully ground her emotional arc. The final renunciation—accepting release from endless mourning—is earned by prior acts of naming, with cost felt in the weight of centuries lifted.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mage’s earnest naivety and brittle devotion are vividly embodied through his ritual with the bell and droplets, not merely labeled. His internal contradiction—fragile loyalty versus quiet determination—drives micro-choices (e.g., warming metal just enough) that feel authentic. However, his emotional arc lacks a tangible cost beyond implied fragility; the resolution feels earned but emotionally frictionless. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Caitlyn’s motivation—expunging myth through quiet observation—is consistent and rooted in generational trauma, but her interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Her choices (following photos, placing the label) feel symbolic more than pressured; the “precisely humane” trait is named but never tested by a micro-choice with visible cost. Emotional progression lacks irrationality or self-deception, rendering her epiphany tidy rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selene’s interior contradiction—scholarly precision versus secret sentimentality—is vividly embodied and drives micro-choices (e.g., gathering shards, whispering incantation). However, her emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle; the “sentimental surge” recalls fireflies but lacks friction with her alchemical discipline. Motivation is consistent but not tested by genuine failure or cost until the very end, where closure absorbs rather than dramatizes the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The seeker’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile memory and ritualized action, avoiding diagnostic labels. His motivation—preserving trust under pressure—is consistent and intensifies with the storm’s aftermath. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see resolve, not struggle. The final choice feels earned, but the cost is emotional rather than behavioral, slightly softening the edge of flaw-driven agency.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through action—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving his decisive strike. His internal contradiction (compassion vs. resolve) manifests simultaneously in the climax rather than as alternating summaries. The final choice feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost: the shattering of pretense and the acceptance of shared stewardship over ownership. However, the apprentice Mara’s introduction slightly dilutes focus without deepening Kael’s arc, limiting full character immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to safeguard space for innovation—is compelling and consistent, driving her design choices with clear interior logic. Her micro-choices (positioning the seed under moonlight, whispering a promise) reveal a hierarchy of values blending wonder and craftsmanship. However, her internal contradiction remains muted; she faces no meaningful resistance or doubt that would deepen her emotional complexity. The final triumph feels earned but lacks the friction of genuine struggle or cost beyond conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conductor’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “mournfully eager” eyes, trembling pull cord, and ritualized gestures reveal a psyche shaped by grief and hope. His micro-choices (whispering lullabies, syncing vibration with hidden mirth) show agency under pressure. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction; the shift from sorrow to gratitude lacks a tangible internal struggle. Still, his motivation feels consistent and humanly flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—feral yet reverent, homesick yet patient—and its pivotal choice to wait (not act) is earned by consistent longing and ritual. However, the final transformation from “feral” to “curator” leans slightly on declarative summary (“now less feral and more curator”) rather than fully dramatized micro-choices, softening the cost of that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—“stoically sensitive,” feeling embers as “whispered promises”—and his micro-choices (adjusting tincture concentration at the penny’s drop) reveal a hierarchy of values. His motivation aligns with consistent traits, and his evolution from hopelessness to quiet triumph feels earned. However, the epiphany that “creative destruction was not merely breaking, but sculpting anew” borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of the shift. The final renunciation of predetermined destiny carries felt cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selin’s motivation—finding beginnings in endings—is embodied through micro-choices (climbing the antenna, discarding assumptions) and aligns with her role as a signal interpreter. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through action: she rejects scholarly nostalgia yet trusts data that borders on mystical. The shard forces a credible endurance (not epiphany), and her final calibration of the transmitter forecloses passive waiting with visible cost—the city’s decay reversed only through her labor. Flawless consistency, though emotional stakes could deepen beyond professional duty.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s motivation—to merge timelines—is vividly tied to his resilient positivity and embodied through micro-choices (turning the radio, whispering to the hourglass). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction via tactile detail (“weight of nothing”) and action under pressure. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth, and his flaw (over-optimism) lacks a tangible misstep that compounds before resolution. The final renunciation feels earned but slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fever dream architect’s motivation—to discover the texture of connection—is compellingly abstract yet embodied through precise actions (weaving, listening, stepping onto the bridge). His interiority remains consistent, though his emotional state borders on diagnostic (“unsettlingly calm”) without sufficient contradiction or struggle. The absence of interpersonal pressure limits relational depth, but his micro-choices (e.g., interpreting hums as echoes, weaving filaments back into architecture) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated rather than earned through tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s “balancedly curious” temperament is consistently embodied through micro-choices—tracing constellations, plotting vectors, returning the chain link—but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; wonder and caution alternate rather than coexist under pressure. Her motivation to navigate by starlight feels deeply personal yet remains abstracted through lyrical summary rather than visceral struggle. The final whisper to the water reads as earned endurance (Earned Stasis), but the cost—forgoing surface memory for alien light—is implied more than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the hearing aid and photograph. Their “persistently curious” nature drives micro-choices (e.g., tuning the scanner, entering the alcove) that feel authentic to their role as a “contact tracer for hearts.” However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; the character moves smoothly from curiosity to commitment without friction or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The final whisper back is poignant but lacks a visible cost beyond abstract duty.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and devotion to the forgotten are embodied with visceral specificity (“breath shallow as the tide,” “trembled as she lifted the fragile book”), grounding her motivation in consistent traits. Her final choice—burying the codex—enacts Earned Stasis: she foregoes personal possession to honor collective memory, with visible cost (sealing secrets away). Internal contradiction is subtle but present: fear of confinement versus pull toward hidden knowledge. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bureaucratic erasure manifests as visceral tension between flesh and code. Her micro-choices (using the shard, pouring ink) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over convenience, memory over deletion. The ghost isn’t just externalized trauma but a mirror she must reconcile with, making her final renunciation of legal death feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in pulse, shard, ink.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s motivation—to translate texture into sound before language dies—is consistent, embodied, and drives every action. His quiet articulacy shapes micro-choices (e.g., whispering to the diamond, tracing bird patterns) that reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over safety. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile perception (“copper veins tingled”) and ritualized gesture. The final renunciation—accepting the language will be locked away—carries visible cost yet feels earned by his prior commitment to resonance over legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to transform bitterness into cosmic laughter—is embodied through concrete action (placing the arrowhead, listening to the phone) and internal shift. Their cryptid-researcher identity informs perception without over-explaining. The final renunciation of the arrowhead carries felt cost, and emotional progression avoids tidy resolution, layering sorrow, hope, and absurdity credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The violinist’s motivation—reawakening beauty—is embodied through tactile actions (bow pressure, pulse-driven signals) and reinforced by the locust shell as an emotional conduit. His internal contradiction (yearning vs. fear of regime reprisal) surfaces subtly in trembling statues and his wordless defiance. The final renunciation—stepping down with bow as “quiet companion”—feels earned, closing a path to isolation with visible cost: he must now wander alone to spread resonance. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion stays grounded in gesture and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Milo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “respectfully rebellious gait” and tactile handling of the storm bottle reveal a coherent, contradictory self under pressure. His motivation—to heal broken promises by linking absences—is dramatized through micro-choices (whispering to the storm, slipping the envelope) that carry visible cost. However, the rival pilot’s sudden nod lacks sufficient relational buildup; their shared recognition feels asserted rather than earned through interaction. Milo remains compelling, but the second character functions more as symbol than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and embodied action, yet her motivation remains abstractly spiritual rather than grounded in personal history or contradiction. Her choices feel inevitable rather than conflicted, lacking the friction of competing impulses. The epiphany about “interpreting silence as possibility” arrives as a lyrical assertion, not an earned shift from prior struggle. Still, her micro-choices—singing, placing the fragment, descending—are consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile and conceptual filters—her “sanely eccentric” worldview embodied in micro-choices like adjusting the scarf to amplify resonance. However, her motivation lacks friction: she reawakens memories without internal contradiction or cost beyond ambient stewardship. The absence of a competing desire or flaw that complicates her task prevents true emotional stakes. Her endurance feels serene rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—capturing a runaway dream—is consistent and emotionally grounded, rooted in the merchant’s vanished pearl. Her interiority is rendered through embodied perception (“felt the world holding its breath”) rather than diagnostic labels. The micro-choice to mix blues with amber sunrise light reveals her hierarchy of values: memory over permanence. However, Lio’s sudden attunement lacks sufficient causal buildup, slightly weakening dual-character credibility under Track C.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s motivation—to free an idea trapped behind fear—is consistent and emotionally resonant, but his interiority leans on abstract longing rather than embodied contradiction. His actions align with motive, yet lack micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The character remains enigmatic by design, but this sacrifices specificity in emotional progression. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The folklorist’s motivation—recovering stolen memories—is rooted in personal and communal loss, intensified by her grandmother’s lullabies and the flood’s trauma. Her interiority is vividly embodied: spores tickle her senses, boots are wet from tide, and she feels the “hum of a story waiting to be rewoven.” Micro-choices—kneeling, arranging caps, lifting the sextant—reveal her hierarchy of values. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; curiosity dominates without meaningful counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in quiet mentorship of resilience, and her internal conflict—nervous backward walking versus forward action—is embodied with poetic specificity. Her micro-choices (e.g., steadying herself after a crack echoes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she risks retraumatization to restore the library. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized resolve; the “combative tenderness” borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient irrational contradiction under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pruner’s motivation—preserving “the color of wonder”—is consistent and emotionally resonant, but his interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. His “insatiably creative” trait is stated, not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The traveler’s arrival introduces a second character cleanly, yet their interaction lacks status dynamics or reciprocal pressure. Final renunciation or endurance isn’t legible; he simply continues, missing a felt cost that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her role as a restorer of fragmented souls, and her interiority is rendered through precise, embodied perception—e.g., feeling the needle “pulse like a heartbeat that gathered the surrounding hush.” Her micro-choices (loosening each knot) reveal a hierarchy of values: peace over noise, restoration over rupture. The final act—winding the net into the mask—is earned by consistent behavior and carries the cost of enduring “lucid unrest.” No diagnostic label-speak or unmotivated epiphanies mar her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is embodied through tactile, precise actions (tracing glyphs, aligning projections) rather than abstract declaration. Her “methodically curious” trait drives micro-choices that carry visible cost: fraying the map, enduring centuries of grief, risking emotional overwhelm. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest via sensory perception (“trembling arm,” “shielded openness”). The final act of merging raindrops across time feels earned by consistent character logic and flaw (empathy as both gift and vulnerability).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mort’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception—his “quietly analytic” stance manifests in tactile engagement with filaments and the snow globe. However, his emotional arc leans toward diagnostic abstraction (“physics of letting go… tension minus attachment equals luminous path”) rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a micro-choice under pressure that visibly forecloses an alternative path. His transformation hinges on reflection, not dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The balladeer’s motivation—to articulate unspoken needs—is vividly embodied through tactile ritual (pressing flowers, painting walls) rather than stated abstraction. His internal contradiction (seldom-heard yet compelled to sing) fuels micro-choices that carry visible cost: each blossom pressed is a sacrifice, each glyph a vulnerability offered to the void. The ghost functions as mirror, not secondary character, preserving single-POV integrity. Final renunciation—offering his own longing into the press—earns Charged Poise with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Ascending Servant’s motivation—seeking joy beneath anguish—is consistent and intensifies credibly, driving his descent to the chamber. His interiority is concrete (“affectionate detachment,” warmth “seeping into his bones”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves smoothly from curiosity to fulfillment without struggle or misstep. The final renunciation (leaving goggles for another) is touching but feels untested by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aria’s motivation—to prove empty spaces remember—is compelling and consistent, rooted in grief and professional identity. Her interiority is vividly embodied through tactile interactions with the telescope and clouds, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The final renunciation (walking away) feels earned but lacks a visible trade-off beyond atmospheric poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s face blindness is vividly embodied in her reliance on light-rhythm over facial features, and her motivation—to capture sky within walls—feels urgent and personal. Her micro-choices (e.g., using the coin’s indentations to guide brushwork) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to perception and legacy. However, interior contradiction remains underexplored; her emotional arc leans toward epiphany rather than struggle, slightly softening the cost of her craft. The final smile reads earned but borders on tidy resolution given the demolition’s violence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s “diligently curious” trait is embodied through tactile engagement with the hopscotch board and phrasebook, not merely labeled. Her micro-choices—tracing diagonals, whispering phrases—reveal a hierarchy of values: discovery over safety, pattern over chaos. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see competence but little struggle or blind spot that compounds before resolution. The final pride feels earned but lacks a visible cost tied to her character flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lunar-eclipse locksmith’s motivation—“to learn the rhythm of repair”—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (e.g., trembling fingers, breath “heavy as fog”). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing emotion through sensory detail (“heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia”). However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; choices feel inevitable rather than contested. The final act of repair shows endurance over transformation, but the cost—nostalgia—is felt yet not dramatized as a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s altruism and trustworthiness are consistent but lack internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure—she functions more as a catalyst than a conflicted agent. The child and Old Mara briefly personalize the community, yet their roles remain illustrative rather than deeply individuated. Motivation is clear but not tested; no flaw or blind spot complicates her guidance. Final renunciation or endurance is absent—her role persists unchanged, weakening character arc closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, breath like frost, and emotional response to the puppet head reveal a layered psyche under pressure. Her motivation (the sailor’s childhood whisper) is consistent and intensifies her actions. However, the final epiphany (“beauty lay in being beautifully flawed”) leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak without fully dramatizing the internal contradiction that precedes it. Still, her micro-choices—placing the head, turning the dial—align credibly with her goal and history.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker’s motivation—bargained, not chosen—is compellingly rooted in obligation, not heroism. Their internal conflict manifests through embodied restraint (“hands empty,” “memory of latent heat”) rather than exposition. The renunciation of personal redemption for travelers’ safety reads as earned endurance with visible cost: the orchard remains cursed, and they must repeat the ritual. However, the lack of a decisive micro-choice under peak pressure (e.g., hesitation before placing the nut) prevents full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—atonement through scientific redemption—is rooted in consistent traits (symphonic perception, polymer expertise) and intensifies credibly. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief is embodied (“loosened grief rise, not as a weight but as a gentle release”). The final choice to translate separation into connection is earned by her river-side insight and scaffold-building action. However, the emotional shift from despair to healing leans slightly tidy, lacking deeper contradiction in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vendor’s motivation is consistent and interiority is poetic, but his emotional arc lacks contradiction or embodied struggle—epiphany arrives without friction. The child’s late entrance introduces a second character cleanly, yet their interaction reveals no status shift or mutual pressure. Final renunciation (“measuring nothingness”) feels earned conceptually but not viscerally; cost is abstract, not felt in the body or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lir’s motivation—“to sandpaper rough memories”—is vividly embodied through sensory action and micro-choices (e.g., tracing tidal pools, pressing palms to ice). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief is tasted as “burnt cumin,” not named. The final renunciation of bitterness for balance feels earned by his methodical process. However, the lack of interpersonal pressure limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The librarian’s “empathetically decisive” nature manifests in concrete, costly choices—retrieving the weight, weaving languages, directing plank-laying—that reveal a hierarchy of values (art over industry, memory over silence). Her interiority is embodied (“vigorous tenderness,” humming forgotten songs) and consistent, though her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene. The absence of secondary characters limits relational crucibles, but her solitary agency suffices under Track A. Final renunciation isn’t needed; her action earns closure with visible communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aria’s motivation is vividly rendered and consistent, rooted in her desire to revive abandoned dreams. Her interiority blends logic and wonder effectively (“chaotically precise” mind), and her micro-choices—aligning shards, whispering equations—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the emotional progression lacks contradiction; she moves steadily toward epiphany without internal resistance or misstep. The absence of genuine struggle or blind spots prevents full credibility in her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motivation—binding forgotten combinations to the library—is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure. Her prism-minded perception refracts knowledge into hues, grounding her actions in a specific cognitive trait rather than abstraction. Emotions are embodied (“latent blaze,” “flickered tattoos”) without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but her commitment deepens credibly, with the cost felt as irreversible transformation: vigilance becomes an open flame.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Auris’s motivation is vividly rooted in his “symphonically minded” need to create music in silence, and his actions—strumming cracks, using the insulator—are consistent extensions of that drive. Interiority remains concrete through embodied perception (“vibration traces the crack’s lineage”) rather than diagnostic abstraction. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves steadily toward epiphany without internal friction or missteps. The hedgehog’s presence adds texture but doesn’t pressure Auris’s choices, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tutor’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensations (the warming stone, magnetic currents on skin) and consistent precision, yet his motivation leans on abstract yearning rather than concrete contradiction. His micro-choices—placing pieces in the sky—are poetic but lack tangible stakes or tradeoffs. The reflection on pawn advancement feels earned, but emotional complexity remains lyrical rather than conflicted. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the single-POV execution shows strong voice-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pacifist’s motivation—cataloging silences to foster empathy—is vividly embodied through ritualistic action and sensory perception, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. His “theatrical sincerity” is consistent and particular, not performative cliché. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; he faces no meaningful resistance or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The final vow feels earned by his method but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation is consistent and interiority rich, but her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—serenity is pursued without meaningful internal resistance. The final renunciation or endurance isn’t dramatized with visible cost; instead, success arrives smoothly. Her “ambition” reads more as devotion than conflicted drive, softening the stakes. The doodling and journaling feel like ritual rather than micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her micro-choices (e.g., releasing the tip rather than keeping it) reveal values with tangible cost. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves from curiosity to resolution without layered resistance or competing impulses in-scene. The epiphany about “listening to echoes” feels slightly unearned as interior struggle isn’t dramatized under pressure. Still, her competence is balanced with reverence, avoiding infallibility.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and professional habit, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—cultivating foresight through wind documentation—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The patch functions as a talisman that deepens her resolve without veering into epiphany. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves with near-unbroken focus, missing a beat of struggle that would ground her competence in human limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bell ringer’s synesthetic perception and devotion to “certifying wonder” are vividly rendered, with interiority tightly bound to sensory experience. However, her motivation remains abstract rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or tangible cost. No meaningful choice or renunciation occurs—she performs a ritual without resistance, stakes, or trade-off. The character functions more as a vessel for atmosphere than an agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—to harvest insights from failure—is compelling and consistent, driving her ritualistic actions with quiet urgency. Her interiority is embodied through tactile choices (arranging driftwood, handling relics) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation of clinging to one path feels earned by her prior reverence for silence and broken cycles. However, her emotional contradiction remains subtly implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly limiting full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—decoding emotion through borrowed poetic cadences—is consistent, embodied in her presswork and interactions with the halo fragment. Her internal conflict between intellectual pursuit and emotional vulnerability manifests through tactile choices (e.g., pressing ink onto the fragment). However, her transformation lacks a decisive renunciation or cost beyond atmospheric resonance; the final shard-collecting feels like continuation, not consequence. The absence of interpersonal pressure limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courier’s jittery interiority is embodied through tactile details (clutching the pendant, racing heart) and consistent motivation rooted in his mentor’s teachings. His micro-choices—offering the pendant to both shepherd and girl—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on wonder-as-duty. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped; he faces no meaningful resistance or doubt, rendering his endurance more ritual than struggle. The absence of contradictory impulses weakens the emotional complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—grounded empiricism versus mystical curiosity—is vividly embodied in her tactile engagement with the prism and frost. Her micro-choices (aligning facets, whispering paradoxical chants) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over certainty, communion over control. The grief she absorbs feels earned, not diagnostic, and her transformation avoids tidy resolution. However, her emotional calibration remains slightly too precise under peak stress, bordering on over-articulated awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “latent sacrifice” and tactile interaction with the bead and puzzle pieces reveal consistent, character-specific motives. Her quiet endurance functions as Earned Stasis, with felt cost in the dimmed bead and relinquished self. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; the choice feels inevitable but not actively contested in-scene. This slightly undercuts the 9+ threshold for motivation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blacksmith’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, hidden scars, and quiet resolve reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. His motivation (coaxing resilience from rubble) intensifies credibly into action. The final renunciation of fear for strength is earned through prior sacrifice (the memory barter). However, his transformation leans slightly toward archetypal purity; a hairline slip in moral complexity prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—uncovering a withheld truth—is consistent and embodied through her sensory mapping practice, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; decisions feel linear rather than fraught. Her emotional arc is clear yet leans toward epiphanic clarity over messy struggle. The final choice to “unmake the cycle” is earned by prior actions but carries minimal personal cost beyond thematic weight. Strong interiority is offset by near-absence of self-doubt or competing desires under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marek’s reticence and warmth are embodied through precise gestures—stacking stones, pocketing sea glass—not labels. His motivation (bottling safety) is consistent and tied to childhood memory, driving micro-choices that feel earned. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“cold stone slab,” “luminescent ache”). However, the absence of interpersonal pressure limits demonstration of status or relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “smile that disguised the weight of centuries” and hands cradling the wick like a “newborn sun” reveal layered emotion without diagnostic labels. The storm herald’s paradoxical “shadowed elation” adds texture, though his agency remains reactive rather than causally pivotal. Micro-choices (lifting the lantern, redirecting the beam) align with her motivation to shape dawn from shadows. However, the herald’s lack of personal stakes or contradictory impulses limits full character reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s watchful nature and dyeing skill are embodied through precise actions, and her motivation—to understand story magnetism—is consistent and deepened by the donor heart. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves steadily toward revelation without hesitation or struggle. The epiphany about “iridescent caution” feels earned but leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak (“stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution”) rather than fully dramatized insight. Her final choice is credible but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motivation—rooted in a desire to translate arboreal memory into human understanding—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions with the sextant and echo-grid. His sorrow is quantified but never diagnostic; it pulses in rhythm with the grid, grounding emotion in sensory detail. Interior contradiction emerges subtly: his repair work both relieves others’ grief and processes his own. The final choice to deconstruct rather than preserve the grid feels earned, with cost legible in the quiet relinquishment of accumulated sorrow.

    Lira’s motivation—rekindling a dying realm through song—is clear and consistent, and her scattered memories evolve into purposeful mosaic by the end. However, her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied; we’re told of “contradictory impulses” but never see them clash in micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation feels earned thematically but lacks the granular struggle that would ground her epiphany. The absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The recluse’s motivation—unearthing wisdom in an old mistake—is consistent and emotionally grounded, driving his pivotal choice to enter the library. His internal conflict between sanctuary and engagement manifests as “staying while leaving,” a nuanced contradiction embodied in pacing and hesitation. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“compassionate and keenly empathetic”) rather than raw, embodied struggle, softening the cost of his renunciation. The curator’s role is minimal but functional, applying just enough pressure to crystallize the protagonist’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The creeping normality noticer’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and micro-choices—pruning the rose, uncovering the box, offering bread to an empty chair—all revealing a consistent, embodied yearning. His motivation (“to find the sacred in the ordinary”) drives action without diagnostic label-speak. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he moves with near-unbroken reverence, missing friction that would deepen stakes. The final renunciation (leaving crumbs behind) feels earned but costless—no path is truly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chief’s motivation—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is rooted in childhood memory and embodied through meticulous actions. Her interiority is concrete (“catalogued every echo,” “precision of a surgeon”), not abstract, and her emotional arc ties directly to the luminous vows. The final renunciation isn’t stated but enacted through ritual recording, earning Charged Poise. No diagnostic label-speak or unmotivated epiphanies mar her portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s motivation—to capture “the sound of trust breaking”—is poetically rooted but lacks concrete behavioral contradiction under pressure; her steadfastness reads more as label than tested trait. Her actions align with goals, yet internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied (e.g., no hesitation or misstep when lunged at). The watch fob functions as emotional anchor but doesn’t force a renunciation with visible cost. Final endurance feels earned but leans on lyricism over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arin’s luminous skepticism is embodied through consistent micro-choices—tasting the air, pressing the ring to his tongue—that reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in empirical doubt yet open to wonder. His internal contradiction (skepticism vs. yearning) operates simultaneously, not as alternating moods. The final realization that his own aura is “a quiet storm” feels earned, not diagnostic, and carries the cost of relinquishing pure objectivity. However, the weather carriers remain underdeveloped foils, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motivation is vividly rooted in her mnemonically gifted artistry and fractured inspiration, driving her toward the lock with emotional urgency. Her interiority is richly embodied—charcoal fingers, trembling care, heart untangling—but leans slightly into diagnostic phrasing (“knot of suppressed ideas”) that borders on label-speak. The final choice to align mirror and lock feels earned by her unique perception, though the guardian’s silent urging risks bordering on externalized convenience rather than fully internal causality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The calligrapher’s motivation—truth as restorative force—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (refusing the council, rereading fragments). Her internal contradiction (hope vs. despair in a toxic world) manifests in tactile actions, not summary. The zinc plate’s reaction to dishonesty externalizes her moral compass without diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of silence for speech is earned, with visible cost implied in societal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bell tuner’s motivation—to preserve “the color of wonder”—is vividly embodied in his daily ritual with the iceberg and copper arm, revealing interiority through tactile action rather than exposition. His micro-choices (tightening joints, watching gulls fall silent) reflect a hierarchy of values with quiet cost: isolation, seasonal muteness, the surrender of speech. However, internal contradiction remains muted; we see devotion but not struggle or doubt, limiting emotional complexity. The character reads as poetic archetype more than flawed individual, though his endurance qualifies as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vira’s motivation—resolving inner static through containment of chaos—is consistent and rooted in her nostalgic android nature. Her micro-choices (approaching the box, whispering code, activating suppression) reveal a hierarchy of values: order, memory, harmony. However, emotional embodiment occasionally slips into abstraction (“fragmented wholeness,” “reclaimed memory”) that borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient sensory grounding. The final smile as a “fleeting glitch” is poignant but risks sentimentality without deeper struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (“to prove that listening heals”) is clear and consistent, and her actions—cataloguing letters, guiding the boy—align with it. However, her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“sandstorm calm,” “narrative pulse”) rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. The child’s arrival at the end introduces a second character effectively, but Mara’s emotional arc lacks friction; her epiphany feels smooth rather than earned through conflict. A stronger sense of personal cost or doubt would elevate this to high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selene’s interiority is richly embodied—her braid sings, her journal fades when read—but her vulnerability-to-strength transformation lacks concrete contradiction or struggle. Motivation is consistent yet abstract; we’re told she encrypts weakness as strength, but never shown a competing impulse that resists this act. The final choice feels earned by atmosphere more than causality, with minimal visible cost beyond poetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, curiosity, and ritualistic discipline feel specific and consistent. Her micro-choices (pressing the wildflower, reading coffee grounds) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in loss and memory. The final act of reclaiming memories feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost implied in the whale’s absence and the chamber’s instability. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The summoner’s motivation is clear and consistent—she acts to silence a dangerous prophecy—but her interiority remains largely atmospheric rather than psychologically specific. Emotions are embodied through sensory immersion (e.g., “hush settle into her lungs”), yet lack contradictory impulses or tangible struggle. Her choices feel inevitable, not fraught; no visible cost emerges beyond the ritual’s success. The final renunciation of the prophecy is earned, but without internal friction that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s patient nimbleness and the narrator’s conflicted desire to decode stone feel embodied and consistent, but her motivations remain partially opaque—why she engages in “agreed upon lies” lacks a micro-choice that reveals cost. The narrator’s shift from interrogation to collaboration is earned through sensory immersion, yet the emotional contradiction (desperation vs. scholarly pretense) resolves too cleanly. Their relationship crystallizes without visible friction or power shift beyond ritualized tea. Still, interiority avoids diagnostic labels and stays anchored in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s motivation is conceptually clear but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; her transformation feels asserted rather than earned through struggle. Interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“archive of quarantined memory”) rather than concrete, character-specific perception. No visible cost accompanies her shift from skeptic to resolved—her “ghostly resolve” arrives without friction or sacrifice. The seashell and garden reflect theme more than reveal character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation—to forgive the unfinished—is compelling and consistent, rooted in her relationship with her late master. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied actions (tracing ink, handling the thorn) rather than abstract reflection. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphanic clarity without sufficient friction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The “wisely enduring” trait feels more asserted than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon echo singer’s motivation is vividly rooted in her perceptive nature and grief for untold stories, driving every action with emotional coherence. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying sorrow through tactile interactions with stone, shell, and song. The final choice—to mend the shell and release echoes—feels earned by her progressive revelations and carries the quiet cost of bearing witness forever. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her resolve never wavers, softening the edge of human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ghost whisperer’s motivation—to salvage purity from wreckage—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (palming the globe, whispering truth). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction via her delicate, almost ritualistic handling of volatile emotional material. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive internal reversal; she endures rather than transforms, which is valid but undercharged for Earned Stasis. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but micro-choices (e.g., embedding dream cameos) reveal value hierarchy with subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The net-mender philosopher is vividly rendered through sensory perception and symbolic action, but his interiority remains abstract rather than contradictory or embodied. His motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—is stated more than dramatized through genuine struggle or flawed choice. The character functions as a vessel for theme rather than an individual with specific contradictions under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; he merely reaffirms his stance without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation as a conspiracy debunker is consistent and embodied through her methodical reassembly of fragments, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she moves from suspicion to revelation without meaningful struggle or self-doubt. Her “sharply observant” trait enables action but never imposes a tangible cost or forces a difficult tradeoff. The final realization feels earned by plot logic but not by internal tension; the epiphany arrives cleanly rather than through flawed perception corrected by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lonely visionary’s motivation is vividly rendered but remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or tangible micro-choices. His actions (arranging mirrors, binding darkness in copper coils) align with his goal yet lack internal friction or visible cost that would deepen characterization. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, and interiority leans toward lyrical declaration over concrete, character-specific perception. A compelling figure, but more symbol than person.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation—to translate ancestral music—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions with the music box and jars. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he moves from wistfulness to redemption without meaningful resistance or struggle. His transformation feels lyrical but unearned by prior causality, as no live path is foreclosed with visible cost. The child’s arrival shifts dynamics, but the poet’s choices remain reactive rather than driven by layered desire.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “logically emotional” duality is embodied in tactile, sensory choices—measuring frequency while feeling poetic tremors—but her internal conflict lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. The tear at the end reads as earned, yet her motivation remains declarative rather than dramatized through struggle. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but her professional identity as engineer shapes perception credibly. However, her flaw never actively complicates a key decision—it decorates rather than constrains.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—her “calm fire,” the cooling of impatience to “steady ember”—and her micro-choices (placing the compass, whispering the mantra) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany: the “unyoke” realization arrives with minimal friction or contradictory impulse in-scene. The lack of active resistance to her goal flattens internal conflict; patience is won more by environment than struggle. Still, her restraint feels character-particular, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“fortified vulnerability,” “watchfully calm”), and her motivation—to expose systemic neglect—is consistent. However, her transformation leans on abstract epiphanies (“forged in the same fire of resistance”) rather than concrete contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. The mentor memory feels illustrative, not catalytic. Her final act lacks a visible tradeoff that would ground the emotional shift in tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chaplain’s motivation—turning apology into action—is compelling and consistent, rooted in his vocation and personal ethics. His interiority is concrete (“mind moving aptly deliberate,” “fingers tracing filigree as if reading a prayer”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, the shopkeeper remains underdeveloped; her wisdom feels archetypal rather than individualized, limiting relationship-as-crucible depth. The final choice is earned, but the cost of redemption remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—ringing an inaudible bell—is vividly tied to her “steadily curious” nature and manifests through embodied choices (e.g., engaging the transliteration protocol, whispering jokes to gears). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and instead reveals contradiction through action: irreverent awe paired with obsessive focus. The yearning algorithm functions as an extension of her psyche, not a crutch. However, the lack of interpersonal pressure or external resistance slightly limits the depth of her stakes within this compressed frame.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lia’s motivation evolves credibly from abstract curiosity to urgent purpose, anchored in micro-choices like fabricating the tribute post and deliberately spreading the lie. Her interiority is concrete (“brightly attentive,” sensing “absence as silence”) without diagnostic over-explanation. The final renunciation—accepting her role as guardian—carries quiet cost through earned stasis. However, her emotional shift lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; desire intensifies cleanly without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The peacekeeper’s motivation—rooted in memory, intuition, and empathy—is consistent and compelling, driving her toward reconstituting the crystal. Her interiority is richly embodied (“calmly intuitive,” sensing rhythms, feeling unspoken hopes), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her choices lack visible contradiction or struggle; she moves with near-perfect clarity, minimizing internal conflict. The final act feels earned but leans toward epiphany over tension.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—fever-dream transformation, lace tip as compass, skin “thinner”—yet their motivation (“euthanasia tourist”) remains abstracted into lyrical longing rather than dramatized choice. Micro-choices (joining volunteers, tracing buoy) reveal values but lack tangible trade-offs; the renunciation of death-seeking feels earned more through tone than causal pressure. No secondary characters exert meaningful relational pressure, limiting crucible depth. Still, emotional contradiction (“gripped reality loosely” while seeking endings) sustains credible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sentinel’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied sensation and poetic metaphor, yet his motivation leans on abstract yearning rather than concrete contradictions. His “patient cool” contrasts with the letter’s “fierce fire,” but this dichotomy remains thematic rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in real time. The final renunciation—burying the letter—is poignant but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses a tangible alternative. Emotional progression feels lyrical but risks therapy-speak (“nurture intersubjective understanding”) without grounding in specific past trauma or present dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Keeper’s motivation—to preserve wisdom’s echo—is consistent and embodied through ritualized action, not exposition. His half-mask and peripheral awareness reflect internal discipline without over-explaining. However, his emotional landscape remains abstract; we’re told he feels “dew on his inner landscape” rather than shown contradiction or struggle. The final departure lacks a micro-choice with visible cost—his devotion reads as preordained, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—collective healing through photo arcs—is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction (“whispered to the air,” “transmute pain into a masterpiece”) rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. She exhibits no meaningful blind spots or flawed choices; her competence is unchallenged, flattening emotional risk. The child’s question and villagers’ tears function as external validation, not internal conflict. Her calmness borders on invulnerability, undercutting the “wounded spirits” she seeks to mend.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her reticence, weathered innocence, and scholarly obsession feel embodied rather than declared. Her micro-choices (placing the notebook, writing, leaving a page) reveal values with quiet cost. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see resolve, not struggle. The final renunciation lacks a visible foreclosed path—her offering feels additive, not sacrificial.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The junkyard prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness is vividly embodied—his actions (carving runes, arranging driftwood, recording on cassette) stem from a coherent, contradictory desire to preserve what he cannot hold. His emotional state avoids diagnostic labels and instead manifests through tactile, sensory choices. The final act of inscribing chalk dust feels earned by prior micro-choices, though the internal conflict occasionally leans into lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction. No secondary characters dilute focus, allowing interiority to dominate with consistent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sage’s motivation—to harness the ephemeral—is consistent and embodied through ritualized action, but his internal contradiction remains abstract rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses. His “changelessly constant” hands contrast with the trembling world, yet this trait functions more as lyrical refrain than a source of genuine struggle or cost. The final screw-tightening reads as earned endurance (Earned Stasis), but the emotional progression leans toward poetic resolution over psychological complexity. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, keeping focus cleanly on solitary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic abstraction (“quiet duty settle like dew,” “hymning the mundane”) that borders on label-speak. Her motivation—executing a flawless goodbye—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (placing the vinyl, selecting chords), though internal contradiction is muted. Mr. Harlan functions more as a symbolic presence than a fully pressured counterpart, limiting relational crucible depth. Still, her decisively kind trait shapes tangible actions with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—finding where shadows go at noon—is vividly personal and consistent, rooted in childhood curiosity rather than abstract questing. Her “quietly deliberate” nature manifests in embodied actions: breath-pausing, tracing glyphs, listening for the key’s tick. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; emotion emerges through tactile ritual (amber on copper, wind through arches). However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored—she acts with near-perfect competence, lacking a visible struggle that would deepen the cost of her success.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—“shrewdly innocent,” “forgiving skeptic”—and her micro-choices (e.g., placing the tooth, recalling past bone-setting) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. However, her motivation leans slightly on abstract self-conception (“turning mistakes into constellations”) without sufficient friction between desire and cost in-scene. The resolution feels earned but borders on epiphany without enough prior struggle against tangible limits.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The star watcher’s motivation—to share light without fire—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with sea glass and the pearl of stillness. Her interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic abstraction (“a core concept that promised calm”), slightly undermining emotional authenticity. Micro-choices (polishing, arranging shards) reveal values, yet her transformation lacks a decisive renunciation or cost that forecloses a prior path. The epiphany feels earned by atmosphere more than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied, with grief filtered through tactile interaction (moss, stones, pendant). Her motivation—to graft meaning onto wounds—is dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling, placing stones, offering the pendant). However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward unearned serenity; the shift from viral trauma to “honeyed hush” lacks friction or contradiction in scene. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the single-POV execution remains coherent and sensorially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The novelist’s internal conflict between doubt and purpose is rendered with lyrical specificity, and her micro-choices—placing fragments on trembling pages, recording cameos—are consistent with her motivation. However, emotional embodiment occasionally slips into abstraction (“doubt gnawed at the edges of her resolve”) rather than concrete sensation. Her renunciation of conventional narrative currents feels earned, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The spiral seashell fragment grounds her agency, but her transformation lacks a decisive physical or psychological pivot that would elevate this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in reverence, not ego, and her micro-choices—reaching with a copper-capped finger, adjusting the lyre—reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete (“heart beat with purpose,” “felt the resonance… vibrate within her chest”) without diagnostic labels. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves with near-unbroken certainty, softening the cost of her devotion. The final renunciation (laying the tendril back) carries quiet weight but feels slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, glacier-slow movements, and heartbeat-synced perception reveal a character defined by tactile ritual rather than exposition. Her motivation (translating heartbeats into luminous maps) emerges organically through action, not declaration. The covenant she forms feels earned because it arises from repeated micro-choices of tending, returning, and sealing—not epiphany. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Corin’s reflective nature and quiet obsession feel consistent, embodied in tactile actions (polishing quartz, angling plates) rather than abstract musing. His motivation—to store wonder—arises organically from his profession and environment. However, the internal conflict lacks true contradiction; he faces no resistance to his project, only procedural hurdles. The “paradox” of capturing echoes is noted but not dramatized as a struggle that alters his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fractal weaver’s motivation is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the grotto, but her internal contradiction remains abstract rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Emotions are rendered poetically yet lack the irrationality or hypocrisy that would ground them in human complexity. The final renunciation feels earned by ritual logic but not by psychological causality. Her agency is clear, yet her struggle lacks tangible resistance beyond atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the carving and kettle, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices—pressing glass over sap, placing the lantern on the hearth—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; the emotional arc leans toward resolution without sufficient friction between opposing desires mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her chronological confusion, eroded ambitions, and regret manifest through tactile actions (gripping the camera wheel, aligning story-shards) rather than diagnostic labels. Her negotiation with her ghost crystallizes a credible renunciation: she trades regret for memory, accepting diminished ambition while reclaiming wonder. The ghost functions as both mirror and antagonist, forcing a micro-choice with emotional cost. However, the ghost’s agency occasionally blurs motivation—is it Mara’s projection or independent?—slightly weakening causal clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The intern’s motivation—resurrecting hope through engineering—is clear and consistent, and her “functionally creative” mindset drives key decisions. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; she moves from stoic wonder to success without meaningful struggle or doubt. Emotions remain abstract (“quiet anthem inside her engineered heart”) rather than physically rendered. Her competence borders on effortless, undercutting the cost of her achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scribe’s introversion and emotional arc are vividly embodied through tactile interactions with tools, crystal, and memory. His internal conflict—between guild pragmatism and sentimental longing—is rendered without therapy-speak, grounded in specific sensory recall (rain, petrichor, lullabies). The renunciation of perfectionism in favor of “quiet friendship” with his dream feels earned, though the transformation leans slightly toward lyrical ease over visceral struggle. A single meaningful micro-choice—inscribing numerals as memory—carries the weight of reconciliation credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seeker’s motivation—to understand the architecture of lies—is consistent and compelling, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; instead, he moves with serene certainty. His actions align with his motives, and the sundial use reveals character under pressure. However, the epiphany about “hindsight clarity” feels slightly over-articulated rather than embodied through struggle. The final resolve is credible but leans toward conceptual elegance over visceral contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seed collector’s motivation is clear and consistent—preserving ancient knowledge—but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene. Emotion is embodied through tactile interactions (knots, fulgurite), yet his "infinitely patient" trait borders on static idealization rather than tested endurance. The final whisper of thanks feels earned but carries minimal visible cost; the burden of centuries is stated more than dramatized. His micro-choices (kneeling, tracing knots) reveal values, but no meaningful tradeoff or foreclosed path sharpens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The traveler’s motivation—mapping “the geography of healing” through obituaries for the living—is consistent and embodied in tactile actions (kneeling, withdrawing thread, writing). His internal contradiction between solitude and connection surfaces subtly in gestures like smiling “a solitary curve against the twilight.” However, his emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice under pressure; he observes, projects, writes—but never wrestles with whether to continue or stop. The final renunciation of closure (“his work was never finished”) is stated rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prince’s internal conflict—between mechanical inheritance and yearning for organic beauty—is embodied through tactile actions (assembling the cradle, whispering theories) and specific emotional textures (“voice trembling like a violin string”). His flaw is consistent and consequential, yet his transformation avoids diagnostic self-awareness. However, the epiphany arrives with slight ease; the “flaw melt[ing] away” lacks the grit of sustained struggle expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars, fire lineage, and compassion intertwine in micro-choices like tracing the red thread or kneeling by the graft. Her motivation (“to prove scars can sing”) is consistent and intensified through action, not summary. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; grief and resolve alternate rather than collide in-scene. The final renunciation of her father’s legacy feels earned but leans slightly on lyrical assertion over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s luminous skepticism is embodied through consistent micro-choices—tracing symbols, whispering names, waiting with “sidereal patience”—and her internal contradiction (doubt vs. devotion to liberation) drives the arc. However, her transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany: the shift from skeptic to “keeper of light” lacks a concrete moment of struggle or sacrifice that would ground the cost. Her flaw (skepticism) recedes rather than being integrated or paid for. The final smile feels affirming but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The otherworldly sentimentalist’s motivation—to share light without fire—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (placing the gear, releasing sonar pings). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, expressing sorrow and resolve through sensory perception (“feeling the weight of every generation’s sigh”). However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; the renunciation of fire feels more inherited than wrestled with. The final choice is earned but lacks a visible micro-struggle that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eliam’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and poetic metaphor, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His motivation—to map collective grief—is consistent and intensifies through ritualized action. However, his choices lack tangible friction or cost; the spectral mentorship removes struggle, making his epiphany feel granted rather than earned. The absence of contradictory impulses in scene weakens emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her “ethically diligent nature” drives her ritual of repair—but internal contradiction is underdeveloped; she experiences no resistance, doubt, or cost beyond abstract weight. Her actions align with motive, yet the absence of struggle or misstep flattens her arc into serene certainty. The final promise feels earned by pattern, not pressure. A single-POV piece this lyrical demands more embodied friction to reach the 8.5+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gardener’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire to recover truth, but his interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. His micro-choices (handling the case, tracing threads) reveal values, yet emotional complexity remains muted—no visible struggle or flaw complicates his actions. The final renunciation (“seed, not weapon”) feels earned but lacks tangible cost beyond poetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartographer’s motivation—to seed innovation within constraint—is compelling and consistent, driving every major choice. His internal conflict between empirical rigor and mythic aspiration is embodied in tools (surveyor’s instruments vs. kingfisher quill) and crystallizes in the final realization about ignorance as canvas. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the “humbled by his own ignorance” moment feels earned but borders on diagnostic phrasing. No secondary characters exert real pressure, limiting relational depth, though this fits the single-POV scope.

    Mara’s motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her transcription of the pirate broadcast with quiet urgency. Her internal state is rendered through poetic but precise sensory detail (“thistled calm,” “dust that hung like old parchment”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her transformation lacks a visible cost or contradictory impulse in-scene; she moves seamlessly from observer to conduit without struggle, weakening the emotional stakes of her choice. The absence of friction between desire and limitation prevents full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to crystallize a fleeting emotion—is embodied through deliberate, tactile actions (sprinkling powder, pressing palm to floor) that reveal interiority without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (aligning mask shards with powder, whispering incantations) consistently reflect a hierarchy of values centered on truth and memory. However, the character remains slightly archetypal; her contradictions are implied but not dramatized in simultaneous impulses. The final renunciation—letting the powder dissolve—is earned and carries bittersweet cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—“rationally rebellious,” agonizing over narratives while sifting sediment—and his final synthesis feels earned. His micro-choice to preserve both stories forecloses the path of singular truth with conceptual cost. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward intellectual resolution over visceral struggle, softening the felt weight of his renunciation. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The choir teacher’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and micro-choices, especially her decision to invite the child and veteran to sing—a pivotal act that reveals her hierarchy of values. However, her “expectantly resigned” trait borders on label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves from resignation to quiet thrill with minimal internal friction. Secondary characters remain atmospheric rather than pressurizing agents, limiting relational crucible depth. Her motivation feels consistent but leans toward idealized competence without tangible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her sensory gift and moral stance, and her micro-choices—whispering to vines, placing the seed in broth—are consistent with her role as memory-taster and gardener of ideas. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied perception (“flavors of childhood, loss, and hope swirled on her tongue”). However, the absence of genuine struggle or blind spots softens the cost; her competence borders on effortless, diluting tension. The final renunciation—pruning old ideologies—is conceptually rich but lacks a tangible personal sacrifice that would ground its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s involuntary truthfulness is embodied in her trembling voice and confessional tolling, not just stated. Her motivation to preserve wonder drives concrete action—retrieving the box, speaking the riddle—and culminates in a renunciation of silence, foreclosing the path of passive guardianship with visible emotional cost. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves cleanly from hope to realization without competing impulses clashing in-scene. The drone’s return feels slightly externalized, reducing the sense that her flaw directly enables or complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., buying the shard to “sanctify my own restless mind”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Motivation—understanding why houses feel alive—is consistent and deepens into catalytic agency. The elderly woman functions as a mirror, not a crucible, but her brief presence reinforces the protagonist’s role without muddying pressure. Final renunciation of passive observation for active noticing is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The living statue functions more as a symbolic conduit than a psychologically complex character. While its motivation (“to welcome nuance”) is consistent and drives action, interiority lacks contradiction or embodied struggle—emotions are stated (“incisively kind”) rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The sea urchin interaction gestures toward empathy but doesn’t reveal hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Character remains a vessel for theme rather than an individual with blind spots or evolving tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aric’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his grim optimism, obsession with the chipped die, and evolving relationship to failure feel specific and non-diagnostic. His micro-choices (building the contraption, incorporating the flaw) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient dramatized struggle in the middle beats; the shift from capturing to honoring missed chances feels earned but compressed. No secondary characters dilute focus, and his flaw actively shapes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her insomnia, hope, and artistic ritual feel specific and lived-in. Her motivation (to resurrect lost languages as acts of kindness) is consistent and quietly compelling. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive internal conflict or contradiction; she remains methodically hopeful without meaningful resistance or doubt. Jiro’s brief appearance serves thematic resonance but doesn’t pressure Mara’s choices, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motivation—to rescue dying arts—is vividly tied to her identity and trauma, embodied through the bread ritual and lens use. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward revival without meaningful hesitation or self-doubt that would deepen psychological realism. The mute potter and vanished poet remain symbolic rather than pressured relationships, limiting crucible dynamics. Her final choice feels earned but leans on thematic inevitability over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The clock maker’s motivation—to step beyond fate—drives every action, and his neatly inventive trait manifests in tangible choices (e.g., crafting a key from rope and brass). Interiority is vividly embodied (“bleak exhilaration pulsed through his veins”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see resolve but not simultaneous competing impulses that would push this into the 9s. His transformation feels earned, yet the cost of rewriting fate is implied rather than viscerally dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her phosphorescent skin, swallowed clasp, and whispered command all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her final choice to “vanish” feels earned through escalating dread and prior micro-choices (swallowing the clasp, placing it on the bridle). However, her motivation leans slightly on external instruction (“to trick fear…”) rather than fully internalized contradiction, softening the psychological depth just enough to keep this below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prophet’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is consistent and embodied through action, not declaration. His internal drive manifests in micro-choices (e.g., striking the mallet with syncopated force) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his interiority remains largely abstract; we see what he believes but not the contradictions or costs beneath it. The final smile lacks emotional granularity—gratitude is asserted, not dramatized through specific, flawed human behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role and environment, with micro-choices (e.g., tracing shell ridges, blowing the whistle) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and stays embodied through tactile engagement with maps, shells, and sound. The shift from seeking answers to vowing to listen feels earned by her pattern-based epiphany. However, her internal contradiction remains subtle rather than dramatized under pressure, slightly limiting emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s “emotionally rational” trait is vividly embodied in his scholarly caution and empathetic analysis, particularly when he weighs poetic allure against cold fact while handling the letter. His internal contradiction—valuing noble lies yet seeking unblemished truth—fuels credible micro-choices, like prying open the mailbox with a salvaged rod. However, his transformation feels slightly too smooth; the dissolution of the noble lie lacks friction or personal cost beyond abstract realization. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but his solitude intensifies thematic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s stoic sensitivity is vividly embodied—her hammering heart versus calm face, tactile engagement with moss and marble—but her internal contradiction lacks escalation under pressure. Motivation (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) feels lyrical rather than causally tested; no tangible cost arises from her choices. The inkwell ritual reveals character but doesn’t force a trade-off that forecloses options. Final renunciation is resonant but not earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a logical page indexer seeking honest origins. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she remains unflappably tranquil throughout, with no visible struggle or moral ambiguity. Her choices feel competent but consequence-free; the cost of her quest is abstract rather than embodied. The final renunciation or endurance isn’t dramatized with personal sacrifice, undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern maker’s grief-driven motivation is vividly embodied through origami cranes and gem-polishing, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His internal contradiction—ascending toward hope while descending into loss—is rendered in concrete ritual rather than abstraction. Every action aligns with his motive to transform sorrow, and the final renunciation (empty lantern, lifted gaze) carries visible emotional cost. No secondary characters dilute focus; interiority remains specific, tactile, and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s grief and motivation are vividly embodied, especially in tactile details like the “suit still scarred by the blast” and “breath that tasted of rust and ozone.” His internal contradiction—grief as fuel yet seeking awakening—is consistent and compelling. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over earned causality; the shift from mourning to clarity hinges more on symbolic resonance than micro-choices under pressure. The final smile feels emotionally coherent but lacks a decisive renunciation or cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s “perpetually surprised” trait is named but rarely embodied in micro-choices with cost; her interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“thrill,” “recognition”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The pilgrim functions more as thematic echo than crucible—his presence enables the ritual but doesn’t alter Lira’s tactics or force renunciation. Final vow to “guard the chip” feels unearned by prior struggle, lacking visible tradeoff or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s guilt and moral struggle are vividly embodied through tactile details (the watch hand, driftwood carvings) and internal contradiction, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. However, the character’s transformation hinges on a single epiphanic moment—“the weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown”—that borders on thematic declaration rather than fully dramatized reckoning. Micro-choices (sifting carvings, placing the watch hand) reveal hierarchy of values, but the final renunciation lacks a concrete, irreversible cost beyond abstract “tempered regret.”

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator’s motivation—recycling past failure into wisdom—is clear and consistent, driving his cautious choices. His interiority is embodied through tactile interactions (the drawer pull, the rope) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. However, the “scarred veteran” counterpart remains a cipher; their relationship lacks reciprocal pressure or status shifts. The protagonist’s emotional arc feels earned, but secondary character flatness limits relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The navigator’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied emotion and consistent contradiction—hope buoyed against sorrow, faith flickering yet persistent. However, his transformation leans on lyrical assertion (“sorrow dissolve into the light”) rather than micro-choices under pressure. The betrayal backstory anchors motivation but lacks a present-tense decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. His final resolve feels earned emotionally but not causally tightened by on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—redemption through empathy—is clear and consistent, driving every choice from the lake’s edge to the mirror chamber. Interiority is vividly embodied (“skin still tingling,” “jaded wonder softened”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (tossing the baseball) earns a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: surrendering a relic of alternate hope to kindle present compassion. However, the internal conflict leans slightly toward resolved clarity rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation—to reforge a bond beyond death—is clear, emotionally grounded, and drives every action. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“bones might become bark,” “heart remained paradoxically steady”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The reluctant metamorphosis crystallizes her contradiction: desire for reunion vs. fear of transformation. Final choice is earned through prior buildup and carries visible cost—her flesh marked by bark, mortality fused with spirit.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is richly embodied—her “willingly perplexed” state, grief, and ritual devotion manifest through tactile choices (unfastening the clasp, whispering names). Her motivation ties cleanly to the twins’ birth and lost time, though her emotional arc leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction. The final renunciation—unfastening her heart’s knot—is earned by prior gestures but lacks a visible interpersonal cost due to the absence of on-page relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nara’s pacifism and emotional embodiment are consistent and vividly rendered, especially in how joy physically lightens her—tying interior state to action. Her micro-choices (smiling against the void, pressing the crystal) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; grief and compassion coexist but don’t clash under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned, yet the absence of genuine struggle beyond endurance slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to understand “the texture of transformation”—is vividly embodied in her handling of the fireflies and her exhaustion from charity, but her internal contradiction lacks active tension; she shifts from skepticism to acceptance without meaningful resistance. The fisherman appears as a thematic echo rather than a crucible, limiting relational pressure. Her destitution is stated but never concretely felt in choices or cost. Final renunciation (releasing the fireflies) is resonant but not earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—sparking a silent revolution—is consistent and compelling, rooted in his “calmly inventive” nature. His interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“eyes scanning… with calmly inventive precision”) rather than abstract labels. However, the absence of internal contradiction or tangible struggle flattens his arc; his success feels frictionless, lacking a meaningful cost that would elevate his renunciation or endurance to Earned Stasis. The bronze quill functions more as symbol than crucible for flawed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selene’s precognitive curse and yearning for sacred patterns create compelling interior tension, but her emotional arc leans on abstract longing rather than embodied contradiction. Her final shift from burden to beacon feels earned thematically yet lacks a visceral, costly renunciation—her “smile” reads as resolution without sacrifice. The curse’s transformation into a compass is conceptually satisfying but minimally dramatized through action or physiological detail.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s interiority is richly embodied—“furiously tranquil,” scars as cities—but his motivation leans on abstraction (“cartography of scars”) without sufficient micro-choices under pressure. His actions (setting timer, placing envelope) feel ritualistic rather than driven by escalating conflict. The epiphany arrives with lyrical grace but lacks a prior contradiction that makes it earned. Still, the voice and emotional texture are singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The characters are vividly sketched with evocative traits—the mechanical arm, the “diplomatically fierce” resolve—but their interiority remains abstract. Motivation (“to turn questions into destinations”) is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The final bow feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice revealing cost. Their roles serve the allegory more than individual psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s molting personas and Rook’s quiet constancy create compelling interiority, but their motivations remain poetic rather than causally urgent. The molting trait is evocative yet lacks concrete trade-offs—no moment shows Lira sacrificing something vital to adopt a new identity. Their bond feels lyrical, not crucible-forged; the coffee tin catalyzes plot, not character evolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pianist’s motivation—rewriting fate through an unplanned encore—is compelling and consistent, rooted in "steely longing." His internal conflict between resignation and defiance manifests in embodied choices (e.g., pressing the chord, stepping through the film). However, his traits remain slightly abstract; “strategically creative” is asserted more than dramatized with concrete trade-offs under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a specific, visceral cost beyond atmospheric resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “empirically whimsical” mind is vividly embodied in her method of translating dream symbols into factual anchors, revealing a coherent interior logic. Her micro-choices—naming vines as maps, orchids as rhythms—show a hierarchy of values that privilege communal memory over individual doubt. The luminous doubt she feels is not abstract but propels her toward the incantation, making her final act feel earned. However, her emotional contradiction lacks visceral physicality; fear and hope remain lyrical rather than somatically rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tutor’s motivation—to find “the color of unspoken apologies”—is evocative but borders on abstract; his interiority leans lyrical over embodied, risking diagnostic label-speak (“sorrow that clung like mist”). Yet his micro-choices (tying knots in lace instructions, placing the compass) concretize his quest. The final breath of apology feels earned through ritualized action, though emotional contradiction remains muted rather than dramatized.
