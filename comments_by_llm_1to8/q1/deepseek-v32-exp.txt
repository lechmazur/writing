    Elara's motivation is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The piece tells us she is "steadily adaptive" and molding "fear into focus," but these traits function as labels without forcing difficult trade-offs or micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The rival artist reveal arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized recognition, and the final resolve to "create something new" reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. Interior texture leans on stock phrasing ("drifting resonance," "harmonic emptiness") that could apply to any contemplative protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("desperate need," "sole compass") rather than embodied contradiction. The heat-mapping method provides concrete action, yet the capsizing trauma remains told rather than lived—"She pressed the cool metal of the fork to her forehead, recalling the boat's violent tilt" summarizes memory without showing how it complicates present choice. The final stance ("she had found her peace") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; we see completion but not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elijah's motivation is present but largely told through abstract phrases ("inadvertently stubborn," "motivation...sharpened into a specific need") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The underwater sequence shows competence and patience but lacks genuine struggle or cost-driven micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The transformation from weariness to "quiet satisfaction" is asserted rather than earned through on-page forfeiture. Internal voice relies on elevated register ("ethereal distress signals," "chased stillness") that reads more thematic than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interior remains abstract—"thoughts as heavy as the humid night air" and "quiet determination" are label-only. The "gently persistent" trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a costly trade-off or mistake under pressure. The youth and elders populate the frame without individual agency; they function as backdrop rather than sources of conflicting demands that would test Elara's hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. The past-life memory arrives as exposition, not lived contradiction; her "spiritually curious nature" is a label without embodied cost. The breathing-change method and tear-touching feel mechanical rather than rooted in character-specific vulnerability. No meaningful internal conflict constrains her choices—she moves through the quest without friction, renunciation, or visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. The retrocognitive visions are told as burden but never shown constraining an on-page decision with visible cost. Interior experience relies on abstractions ("texture of time," "prison of shadows") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "smile" and newfound peace feel unearned because no prior moment shows her genuinely struggling between contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara exists purely as label-only motivation ("chained liberator," "patiently strategic") with no contradictory impulses or embodied interiority. The guard appears without prior establishment, serves as a prop to be tripped, then vanishes without reaction. The chains "loosen" symbolically at the end with no earned causality—no dramatic event motivates their release, only thematic convenience. Micro-choices are absent; Elara's actions read as plot mechanics rather than decisions under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("quest born from personal loss") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The synesthesia trait remains ornamental—colors are "heard" but never constrain a single decision or create embodied cost. Interiority consists of generic reflection ("she realized," "she hypothesized") and therapy-speak abstraction ("trust breaking," "collecting absences") without character-particular perception. The ending's "strange peace" and tool-packing arrive without visible foreclosure of a live option or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("press her ear against destiny's door") is evocative but remains abstract; the story never dramatizes a micro-choice that reveals genuine cost between competing goods. Her "quietly savvy" nature is asserted twice but never constrains a tactic—she slips through danger without meaningful friction. The flower-code competence and moonbeam tool feel like stock fantasy-thief kit rather than flaws forcing mistakes under pressure. No visible internal contradiction acts in scene; the final escape reads convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (crafting safe zones) is clear but remains abstract throughout; the emotional thaw is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The decision to leave her former studio is recounted in reflection without on-page cost or friction. Embodied emotion is largely absent—grief and thaw are declared ("her heart thawed") rather than shown through specific physical sensation or contradictory choice under pressure. The final departure carries no visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The phobias are told ("of heights, of enclosed spaces, of falling") but never tested on the page—no embodied terror shapes a choice. Internal conflict is summarized ("he remained firmly adaptive, using each panicked breath") instead of shown as simultaneous warring impulses. The final confrontation declares transformation ("his vulnerability became his power") without earning it through prior scene work where fear constrained a micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Oracle's "mild obsession" to draw a map is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost. Her meditation and focus are described at length, but no on-page choice reveals internal contradiction or forces a trade-off. The ending grants fulfillment without visible sacrifice; she simply completes her task and descends with "profound peace," leaving motivation static and the final moment unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    J-7's motivation to find where thoughts originate is declared but never generates on-page contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final "realization" that thoughts emerge from questioning and uniting fragments reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through summary rather than dramatized struggle. Internal experience remains static throughout; the robot's "remarkably composed" state persists without embodied cost or degradation under the temporal stress it encounters. Diagnostic label-speak ("burning curiosity," "profound connection") replaces specific, embodied perception at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared clearly but her interior life remains thin—we're told she seeks transparency but her moment-to-moment choices feel procedural rather than embodied. Marco's admission arrives late and his guilt is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The climactic mutual acknowledgment ("After words became unnecessary, a simple nod between them…") tells the emotional shift rather than showing it through embodied tension or cost. Emotional progression is summarized ("spirits lifting as if a burden had vanished") rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared repeatedly rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her "wisely pragmatic" nature functions as a label without internal friction—she never wavers, doubts, or pays a visible personal cost for her convictions. The marbles operate as symbolic tokens rather than embodied choices that foreclose options. Emotional states are asserted ("she smiled") without embodied contradiction or degradation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, but his interior life remains thin—we see his "quiet thrill" and validation without contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Dr. Aris functions primarily as witness rather than pressure source; her skepticism dissolves instantly without friction. The "obliging sky mechanic" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. Emotional progression is linear and tidy, lacking the irrational complexity that would elevate characterization above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained (unravel the ghost's code), but her interior life remains thin—she observes and reacts without embodied contradiction or genuine cost. The ghost encounter feels obligatory rather than character-driven; her choices never force a trade-off between competing wants. The final "inspired to compose anew" is an asserted epiphany, not earned through on-page struggle. Emotional states are labeled ("felt a chill," "inspired") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior state is established through concrete details (fever-broken body, swaying certainties), and her motivation to confront buried truth feels genuine. However, her transformation arrives through reflective summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure—"she realized," "she saw," "she felt" dominate the closing third. The final acceptance (pinning the illustration back with a new smudge) reads as symbolic gesture rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority remains abstract in peak beats: "swaying certainties," "fault-tolerant oracle," and "peripherally aware" function as labels more than embodied contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clearly established and his skepticism shapes his interpretive lens throughout. However, interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("drowsy alertness," "religiously skeptical") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic understanding—connecting valve wheel to confession—feels somewhat passive; he receives the epiphany rather than earning it through a difficult micro-choice. The final gesture of placing the valve back is symbolic but doesn't foreclose a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    The chronicle keeper remains an abstraction throughout—"they" observe and witness but never make a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. Interiority consists of philosophical labels ("grips reality loosely," "witnessing change without judgment") rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. The journey to the refuge and return involves no decision or renunciation that alters their state; the keeper begins and ends in the same stance. No micro-choices under pressure appear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a static therapist-archetype throughout; her "mellow" and "cautious exuberance" are asserted labels rather than embodied contradictions. Leo's transformation from withdrawn to wonder-filled is summarized across years without on-page struggle or credible resistance. The baby hair curl functions as a declared totem but never constrains a choice or creates internal friction. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("nurture lifelong wonder," "link") and stock phrasing without character-particular texture or embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian is defined by labels—"odd historian," "sensitively perceptive"—rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is declared sacred but never tested by a competing want or cost that would reveal his hierarchy of values. The final "mending the rift in time itself" arrives as assertion rather than earned change, with no visible forfeiture or mistake that foreclosed a path. Interiority remains generic and over-articulate for crisis conditions: "he sensed," "he deduced," "he realized" scaffold every beat without embodied perception or irrational self-deception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara and Leo read as functional archetypes (cryptic writer, ex-spy) rather than individuals with contradictory impulses. Motivation is declared ("transpose life into a new key") but not embodied through micro-choices under pressure; the meeting unfolds as scripted plan rather than through genuine struggle. The phrase "accidentally prophetic" remains a label without cost or friction—no on-page moment shows her wrestling with unintended consequences. Emotional states are asserted ("heart racing") rather than enacted through contradictory action or embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Father Elian's motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions—remains abstract and is never embodied through contradictory impulses or internal friction. His method unfolds without visible struggle or cost to his own certainty; he executes a plan rather than wrestling with doubt. The possession entity is told rather than dramatized, reducing the antagonistic pressure to conceptual narration. Interiority relies on stock metaphysical phrasing ("muffled clarity," "unraveled stillness") rather than character-particular perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to conduct unheard symphonies is declared but never tested by any countervailing desire or meaningful choice. Her interior is a catalog of abstract longings—"chronologically homesick," "aching for lost summers"—delivered as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The mapping activity proceeds without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses an alternative path. The final "smile" and contentment read as assertion, not earned transformation grounded in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's interiority is almost entirely abstract—"fractured reflections," "labyrinth of self"—with no concrete contradiction or embodied emotion. The character operates as a philosophical mover through allegorical space rather than a person with recognizable impulses. The final "simply Kaelen, at peace" reads as unearned summary without prior micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Motivation is declared rather than dramatized through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's journey from numbness to reawakening is clear and her agency drives the phonograph experiment, but key moments rely on telling rather than embodied contradiction—"no longer numb" is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in action. The backward-song transformation occurs too smoothly without visible resistance or cost beyond tears of reawakening. Interior voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("filament of hush had guided her") that reads more thematic than character-particular under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior relies heavily on abstract labels ("credibly curious," "nurture integrity") rather than embodied contradiction. The collaboration with the stranger occurs without visible internal friction—her "intuitive" trust bypasses any dramatized risk calculus. Motivation is declared ("to nurture integrity") but the turn from solitude to partnership lacks a felt cost that forecloses the former path. The ending asserts growth ("integrity could flourish in communion") as thesis rather than earned realization through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and his final choice is concrete—sacrificing memories to free the energy beings. The interiority tends toward abstract philosophizing ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful nature") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice itself is dramatized but his internal conflict feels more declared than lived; the "laughed softly, a sound without mirth" moment gestures toward complexity but doesn't sustain contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Backstory is managed efficiently via the rope memory, yet the decision hinges more on thematic irony than on a felt hierarchy of values with visible cost scaled to character.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her "acoustically perceptive" trait remains label-only; we never see her hear absences in a way that constrains a choice. The nightly ritual unfolds without internal friction—she never questions whether releasing echoes honors or exploits her family's memory. Emotional progression is smooth and therapeutic rather than jagged and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's transformation is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The piece tells us she "decided to subsume her own crafted personas" and "felt a surge of genuine empathy" without dramatizing the internal conflict that would make such a shift credible. Her motivation "long buried under years of deceit" appears as exposition rather than embodied struggle. The final change reads like a declaration of intent rather than a foreclosed path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivations are stated rather than embodied in present conflict ("motivation, long simmering" is told directly). The character remains externally functional but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; her "shrewd" nature and "whimsical attentiveness" are labels without visible cost or tradeoff. Anya appears late and her interiority is accessed only through summary, weakening the relationship crucible. The final "transformation" is declared across weeks in summary rather than earned through a single pivotal choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly signaled but her choices lack meaningful internal contradiction. The "luminescent ache" is asserted repeatedly rather than embodied through conflicting impulses in action. Her discovery of the tag feels passive—she happens upon it rather than earning it through a choice that forecloses another path. The welcome at the end arrives without visible cost or renunciation on her part.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly (free the echoes) but her internal contradiction or struggle never materializes on the page—she executes her plan without genuine cost or hesitation. The "borrowed time aged her slightly" arrives as告知 summary rather than embodied consequence that alters a subsequent choice. Her occupation as illustrator is ornamental; it never constrains a decision or filters perception in a character-specific way. Interiority remains generic ("peace in her heart") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his interior life is established through his work with the glass eyes and memories of Lyra. The shift from "solving a problem to accepting a mystery" reads as told epiphany rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ambiguous loss is more thematic backdrop than lived pressure that forces micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority remains somewhat abstract ("buried optimism," "faint hope") rather than embodied through concrete perception and action under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is stated but remains abstract throughout; "to become visible to those who needed him" never faces a concrete cost or meaningful internal contradiction on the page. The "kindly methodical" trait is declared repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates friction—he moves through the story without genuine struggle or competing impulses. Sense memory is told as emotion ("tears to his eyes") rather than embodied through contradictory physical reactions or micro-choices under pressure. The ending fulfillment reads as a summary of impact rather than an earned shift in self-knowledge or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal arc from control to surrender is clearly motivated and tracks through concrete micro-choices (releasing the leaf, placing her hand on the tree without tying it down). The interiority leans heavily on reflective summary rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene—"reluctant metamorphosis" and "sustaining transformation" are stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses. The final gesture of solidarity carries visible cost (foreclosing her rigid methods), but the change feels more narrated than inhabited under pressure. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("circuitously sincere," "monumental") slightly dilutes character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clearly stated and embodied through his painting practice, and the exchange with Elara represents a genuine choice that forecloses solitary interpretation. However, the character arc relies heavily on summary and reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final shift—sleeping better, dreams of understanding—is told rather than dramatized through a concrete micro-choice that costs him something visible on the page. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than embodied in simultaneous, competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's motivation (guard the cave, dedicate himself to magnifying everyday magic) is stated rather than tested by conflicting impulses. Elara's arrival catalyzes change, but her interiority remains thin—"wide-eyed" and "trembling" are stock gestures. The final transformation ("her spirit intertwined with the unseen forces") is declared, not earned through prior micro-choices that show her wrestling with a cost. Internal contradiction and embodied emotion are largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—compiling fragments to reveal buried truth—but her internal experience remains abstract. The "reactively visionary mind" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to hold the ceremony feels orchestrated by plot need rather than earned through visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. Embodied emotion and genuine struggle are largely absent; she moves through the narrative without friction or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by internal conflict or competing impulses. Her "meticulous route mapper" trait and "analytically artistic approach" remain labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final "redemption" and transformation are asserted through summary ("her spirit renewed," "peace") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock epiphany language ("trembling certainty solidified into peace") and therapy-speak ("healing the cracks in her own soul") that flattens emotional particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared ("to offer solace," "brave compassion") but remain abstract throughout. Her transformation from skeptic to believer occurs through passive reception of visions rather than active contradictory choices under pressure. The tile's memories simply flow into her without visible internal conflict or cost. Her "courageously kind heart" is told rather than demonstrated through a difficult trade-off that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is established early ("to discover what happens after goodbye") but his interiority is abstract and label-heavy rather than embodied. The final moment offers a shift ("his boredom shattered into something akin to awe") but it reads as assertion rather than dramatized contradiction. Micro-choices are missing; he proceeds through the plan without genuine internal conflict or divergent impulses acting simultaneously. The ending renunciation (the fragment gone, question unanswered) arrives without visible cost that forecloses a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo's interiority is largely abstract and philosophical rather than embodied—he calculates "angles of approach" and "probabilities" without concrete struggle or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic exchange with the security chief reads as assertion rather than earned transformation: "his eyes flickered to the pot, and Leo saw his rigid thinking liquefy" tells the reader the effect rather than dramatizing resistance, confusion, or visible cost in the moment. The protagonist's motivation remains a declared thesis ("to find the mathematics of a fair trade") that never collides with competing desires or generates genuine internal conflict. Therapy-speak labels ("liquefies rigid thinking," "deathly vitality") replace character-particular perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent—collecting textures of time—but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The "earnestly studious focus" is told repeatedly without contradictory impulses or genuine struggle on the page. His choices (waiting, noting, descending) follow a routine with no visible cost or path foreclosed; the ending returns him to the same cycle without alteration or renunciation that would earn closure. Emotional states are summarized ("feeling the weight of the textures") rather than dramatized through specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is established and pursues his goal coherently, but interiority relies on elevated, abstract phrasing ("filtered reality differently," "palimpsest of a life") rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization—piecing together his attempted murder—arrives through accumulation but lacks a visible micro-choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost; he simply "stands there" with knowledge. The absence of embodied tension at closure and the reliance on summary over dramatized choice prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority consists largely of abstract epiphanies ("The universal riddle was decoded...through resonant hums of life itself") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "reimagined conversations" are told rather than dramatized with micro-choices that foreclose paths. Her final acceptance arrives through philosophical summary rather than a decision with visible cost on the page. Motivation remains declarative—"to decode a universal riddle"—but never crystallizes into conflicted action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior shows orderly planning layered with intuition, but her dual allegiance remains declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The foundation stone chip appears as a recurring object, yet its handling doesn't reveal character under pressure beyond symbolic attachment. Micro-choices exist (selecting wall, composing symbols) but feel illustrative of her role rather than foregrounding competing loyalties with visible cost. The final "weary accomplishment" reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (preserving Cassini's Tear) is clear and sustained, but her interior remains static across the vigil—no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "purposefully curious" trait is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting actions. Embodied emotion is present (warm grain against palm, breathing focus) but the final act—pressing the shutter—carries no visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply completes her mission as planned. The nightwatch grain functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a choice-forcing object.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's blindness is mentioned but never meaningfully constrains a choice or creates visible cost; she works "with unwavering patience" through a repair that encounters no genuine setback. The drone repair proceeds in a smooth, competence-only arc with no mistakes or contradictory impulses forcing a trade-off. Her "heartfelt" quality and "magnetic calm" remain label-only; we never see her under pressure making a choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The successful repair feels automated rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows consistent interiority tied to his quest, with micro-choices like tracing condensation and comparing the phrasebook. However, his dry wit feels asserted rather than embodied through specific perception—"Glaciers make poor cartographers" lands as a writerly quip, not organic thought under pressure. The final revelation at the fissure lacks visible cost; he feels peace but immediately second-guesses it in abstract terms ("What if this discovery altered nothing"), which reads as philosophical musing rather than a stakes-driven trade-off. Internal contradiction is present (peace versus worry) but never forces a choice that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is stated ("to restore shared balance") but never internally tested or contradicted; he proceeds methodically without visible doubt or competing impulse. The "infinitely patient" attribute remains label-only—no moment where impatience would cost him, no tradeoff dramatized. Embodied emotion is absent; he "does not smile" and "nods" but never experiences contradictory feelings or stakes that would force a hierarchy of values. The final departure reads as inevitable completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to capture the gathered hush is declared but never tested by a competing want or fear; he executes a linear plan under time pressure without internal contradiction. The "override instinct" moment ("His every instinct screamed at him to rush...But he knew success depended on his ability to override instinct") is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("touching something eternal," "lonesome splendor etched into his soul") rather than character-particular perception. The final self-rescue metaphor arrives as summary wisdom rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation (redemption through threading his story) is stated but his choices feel abstract—whispering lies to walls rather than concrete trade-offs. The hovering wardens dissolve without resistance, and the bodies' discovery arrives too late to create genuine friction. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves with singular purpose through a labyrinth that listens rather than tests. The final choice lacks visible cost: he "offers his story" and is granted passage without foreclosing a credible path.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian has minimal internal contradiction or on-page struggle—his emotions are labeled ("mournful elation") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ghost bride's motivation spans lifetimes but her present agency is thin; she appears, offers the bead, and vanishes without a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("his heart heavy," "wave of...grief and joy merging") instead of character-particular perception. The resonant awakening floods Elian with memories, but this is a convenience unlock rather than a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("carve a path from ruin to reverence") but never tested by a competing desire or external pressure that would force a hard choice. Her "hauntingly optimistic" attribute is labeled but not dramatized—no on-page moment where optimism costs her tactically or forces a trade-off. The sewing action proceeds without friction or blind spots; she moves with "dreamer's certainty" and succeeds linearly, foreclosing the possibility of earned change or credible endurance. The closure restores the labyrinth without visible cost to Elara herself; she simply "stood, her task complete," leaving no forfeited path or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "warmly curious" nature is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interior access remains shallow—her motivations are declared ("to restore the lost faith") but never tested by contradictory impulses or credible obstacles that force visible trade-offs. The work of excavation and reconstruction is summarized across weeks without embodied struggle, cost, or mistakes that compound. The final "restored heart" reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a transformation forged by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("deep-seated need to discover meaning in the margins") but never generates an on-page contradiction or cost. Her actions—tracing, chalking, checking—read as competent task completion without visible struggle or trade-off. The "carefully inventive grace" and "carefully inventive approach" are label-only repetitions that do not constrain a choice. No internal conflict dramatizes competing impulses; she simply executes her process and feels "accomplishment."

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's foolish-disguise trait is clearly established and constrains her interaction with the captain, creating a motivated pivot when discovered. The interior work is specific ("using the threads as a conduit," "navigating through adjacent possibilities"), though the embroidery-as-truth-seeking mechanics remain somewhat abstract. Embodied emotion is present in the slumped return to persona and the breath before extinguishing the candle, but peak-beat interiority leans toward explanation ("This was how she worked") rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final choice to blow out the candle carries cost but arrives quickly after discovery without sustained internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—finding the unspoken apology moment to decide on forgiveness—but interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("knot of unsent letters," "fierce tenderness") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The decisive shift to forgiveness at the end is declared more than earned through embodied struggle; we're told she chooses it "not for him, but for herself" without prior on-page micro-choices that dramatize the competing pulls. Emotion is often labeled ("fierce tenderness," "aching love") rather than shown through specific physical sensation or perception under pressure. The gargoyle shard and spirits function as externalized devices rather than forcing internal conflict that shapes her stance.

    Elara's motivation (grafting new meaning onto old wounds) is established but mostly remains abstract until the Kaito memory provides concrete footing. The interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent") that reads as label rather than embodied contradiction. The decryption work shows agency but unfolds in summary narration rather than moment-by-moment discovery with micro-choices under visible cost. The anesthetic frame allows reflection but flattens present-tense pressure, making the final "completion" feel declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established (rediscover lost joy) and drives her actions throughout. However, interiority often tilts toward label-only emotion ("pensive mirth," "quiet warmth") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final epiphany—"joy was not lost, merely waiting"—reads as declared rather than earned through a difficult choice with visible cost. Minor issue: no genuine internal conflict complicates her pursuit; she moves smoothly from discovery to light-painting to satisfaction without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("exchange certainty for curiosity") but never dramatized through a genuine decision with cost. Her actions—prying the coin, tapping the crystal, tossing it—read as curiosity-driven exploration without internal conflict or competing impulses. The "methodically playful" attribute appears only as a label repeated across multiple beats without constraining a single choice. Interiority consists largely of abstract epiphanies ("nested awakenings," "infinite wonder") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("stand guard over her own spark of defiance") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her actions—shaking the rattle, scattering seeds—feel generic and interchangeable rather than arising from character-specific choices under pressure. The club members are flat props with no distinct voices or pressures. The "candidly cryptic" attribute is label-only; the single example ("beetles dance to a tune we cannot hear") feels inserted rather than woven into her natural speech pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The insomniac poet remains abstract—a collection of labels ("shyly unstoppable," "trembling hand") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of atmospheric claims ("centuries of longing") rather than character-particular thought. The final "rest" and palm-tattoo moment lack causal grounding in prior struggle; no path is foreclosed with visible cost tied to specific wants in conflict. Motivation is declared ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") but never dramatized through a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established—preserve forgotten names—but her interior life remains largely one-note reverence without contradictory impulses. The "foxglove regret" label recurs without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal competing values. Her actions follow a gently systematic path with no visible struggle or genuine flaws that complicate the resolution; the crack is mended through discovery and application without cost to her person or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore trust is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses; her actions follow a smooth, calculated path without genuine struggle. The "carefully reckless" trait appears as a label rather than embodied tension—her plan proceeds methodically without visible cost or misstep. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "cautious exuberance") and the final reunion dissolves conflict too easily. Kaelen's arrival feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to bridge council and historians is clear, but her interior life remains thin—motivations are stated more than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The chain and envelope work provide concrete actions, yet the protagonist's emotional progression reads smooth and declarative rather than irrational or conflicted. The final "trembled with quiet joy" and whispered assurances feel performed rather than discovered through dramatized cost. No evidence of blind spots or credible mistakes that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs is declared but never pressures a present choice; her "reinvented history" remains label-only until Leo discovers the letter, a reveal that arrives via convenience rather than earned contradiction. Internal conflict is summarized rather than shown in simultaneous impulses. The meteorite chip and pigeons function as props without constraining her decisions under stress, and the final "learning to trust and love again" arc telescopes emotional recovery without embodied cost or credible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to discover why some thresholds feel sacred") but never tested by a genuine on-page choice with cost. Her "featherly determined" trait is label-only, appearing as repeated description without constraining action. The final realization ("thresholds are doors to becoming") arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing and therapy-speak ("emotional and temporal gaps that honored transition") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "learn the rhythm of belonging" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("deep motivation," "profound connection") and label-only emotions without embodied contradiction. The burnt feather discovery and final epiphany arrive without visible cost or foreclosed options; she simply accumulates insights in a therapeutic arc. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs—she leaves enriched but unchanged, violating the requirement for credible endurance or alteration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is declared but never tested through competing impulses or genuine difficulty. The character observes and conjectures throughout but makes no choice that forecloses a path or costs him anything tangible. Emotional states are labeled ("cheerful gloom," "pang," "determination") rather than embodied through contradictory action. The final "vow" arrives without prior struggle, reading as summary rather than earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her choices never face meaningful resistance or contradiction. The performance is executed flawlessly without struggle, blind spots, or genuine internal conflict—she orchestrates petals and a balloon with complete control and watches satisfied faces, never risking failure or paying an embodied cost. The analytical street performer trait remains label-only; we're told she's analytical and that her mind "constantly deconstructs rhythms" but we never witness her problem-solving under pressure or making a difficult micro-choice that reveals competing values. The bishop piece is handled but functions as symbolic window-dressing rather than constraining action or revealing character through use.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is heavily abstracted through labels ("obsidian grace," "cosmic verse") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to create forbidden art never faces a concrete choice that would reveal competing impulses—she proceeds through the ritual without hesitation or visible cost. The exile backstory is exposition-only; no micro-choice in the present dramatizes what she's renouncing or risking. The final collapse feels decorative rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to find profundity in the mundane—but her interior life remains largely abstract and declarative rather than contradictory or embodied. The stone-casting moment offers a practiced ritual, yet no genuine internal conflict surfaces; she observes, interprets, and arrives at her insight without struggle or cost. The final "smile, ready for whatever came next" registers as summary rather than a foregrounded choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward philosophical narration ("noctilucent reckonings," "custodian of illumination") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (translating pain into universal language) is clearly stated but remains abstract rather than embodied through concrete choices under pressure. The walk itself is passive observation; no on-page decision alters her state or forecloses a path. Interior reflection dominates without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves steadily toward acceptance without genuine struggle. The "gently skilled" trait and scars are labeled repeatedly but never constrain a choice or create visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's attribute "logical dreamer" and "lucidly watchful" remain label-only; her choices to adjust stone patterns feel automatic rather than driven by internal contradiction or visible cost. Interiority is heavily declarative ("her motivation was clear," "she was lucidly watchful") rather than enacted through embodied perception under pressure. The final placement of the pearl completes a task without foreclosing a live alternative or dramatizing a trade-off. Emotional progression is absent; she moves from serene observation to serene completion without any internal friction or degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to discover what walls dream about") is present but remains abstract throughout; her interior reactions to the diary discovery are summarized ("felt that burden now") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The choice to carry the diaries forward lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page—she simply places them in her satchel and continues. Her perceptive trait is asserted repeatedly ("sensitively perceptive," "perceptive nature," "perceptive heart") but never dramatized through a micro-choice constrained by that sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's motivation is declared but never tested by concrete opposition or cost. Interior states are asserted through labels ("perceptively calm," "borrowed heartbeat") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The work complete, she "slips away" without any visible forfeit or transformation—no path is foreclosed, no flawed choice compounds. Agency reads as observation rather than decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is dominated by abstract declarations ("price of redemption," "anchor ideals in practice") rather than embodied contradiction. The sacrifice decision arrives pre-made; we never see her wrestle with whether to pay the cost, only narration asserting she "had accepted this." The warring clan representatives are placeholders with no distinct voices or micro-choices. Diagnostic therapy-speak pervades peak beats: "muster every ounce of courage and compassion," "operatively gentle manner," "fragile trust."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's amoral/sentimental contradiction is stated repeatedly rather than enacted in a scene that forces choice between these impulses. The egg ritual unfolds without genuine internal resistance—his "amoral nature argued" is summary, not dramatized conflict. The "fractured grace" of his movements and the final "sliver of fractured grace" are label-only; no micro-choice under pressure reveals competing values with visible cost. His knowledge of the drought's origin and the echo-release mechanism appears fully formed without discovery beats that would ground his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to defy conformity is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The piece tells us she's moved by "defiance" and collects echoes, but we never witness an internal struggle between safety and liberation that would earn the transformation. The final state—"a woman composed of her own choices"—arrives as assertion rather than visible cost; no prior comfort or relationship is forfeited on the page. Interiority leans heavily on abstract poetry ("bodily poetic grace," "symphony of defiance") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to explore ethical storytelling is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized—she "contemplates," "realizes," "decides" in exposition without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The micro-choice to "reverse" her approach is explained but not earned through on-page pressure; Marco's threat vanishes without forcing a trade-off. Therapy-speak ("half-lit epiphanies," "introspection," "inner resolve") replaces embodied emotion at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear—to honor overlooked histories—but his choices feel contemplative rather than pressured. The act of building the arch and tying the moth wing reads as ritual observation; no contradictory impulses or visible cost complicates the decision. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("heart ached," "tears pricking his eyes") rather than embodied emotion. The final act of releasing the wing arrives without a dramatized tradeoff that would foreclose a path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads as decorative rather than contradictory. Phrases like "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" function as labels rather than embodied emotional states with competing impulses. The final transformation lacks visible cost—she achieves her goal without struggle, renunciation, or meaningful failure. Her competence faces no genuine obstacle that forces her to trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    Foresight Hindsight's motivation (discovering why paths choose walkers) is present but underdeveloped through concrete action. The "decaying directive" provides backdrop but her internal conflict never manifests in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves smoothly from preparation to realization without embodied struggle. The final transcendence reads as an asserted epiphany rather than a choice earned through prior contradiction and cost. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphysical concepts ("essence resonates with path's inherent nature") rather than character-particular embodiment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aris remains a conceptual vessel rather than a living mind. His "frugal" trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatizes a meaningful choice or cost—he never weighs reusing materials against urgency, never sacrifices comfort for calculation. Internal contradiction is absent; he paces, chuckles dryly, and trembles on cue without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic covenant-sealing unfolds without visible struggle or foreclosed paths, reducing agency to ritual choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Kael's transformation unfolds through imposed "cellular memory" rather than earned internal choice, bypassing genuine struggle.

Emotional progression follows a therapeutic template ("Remember the joy," tears, smile) without embodied cost or resistant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation to "capture that dream" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His interior life consists largely of task-oriented narration ("He felt it snap into place") without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. Lyra exists only to provide synchronized breathing; she applies no pressure and has no stakes. The final "changed" state is asserted, not earned through visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared rather than tested on-page—her desire to bridge generational wisdom drives narrative summary but never forces a contradictory choice under pressure. The feisty trait is labeled repeatedly but does not constrain any action with visible cost. The reunion with Lyra arrives off-stage (weeks pass) and the embrace feels awarded rather than earned through dramatized renunciation or trade-off. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("deciduous vows," "accidental insights") and stock gestures rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is established, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet") rather than embodied contradiction. The bathroom breakthroughs feel declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her final acceptance reads as an insight delivered to her rather than earned through visible struggle, and the cost of placing the cameo back among the roots remains conceptual without a felt trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "carefully resourceful" trait surfaces in several beats (consulting the diary, cross-referencing gaps), but her interior life remains thin—she "assessed their scant options without panic" tells rather than embodies contradictory impulses. Kael's fear is asserted ("grew impatient, his fear palpable") but never dramatized through embodied perception or micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final choice—Kael confronting his error—lands without visible struggle or cost on his part; the botanical diary does the heavy lifting while both characters glide through the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through a meaningful on-page choice with visible cost. Interior states are labeled abstractly ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The twin's absorption is told in retrospect without dramatized tension, and the final "recapture" arrives as assertion rather than earned through struggle. The ending claims wholeness but no path was foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated ("to translate confusion into clarity") but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The phrase "warmly methodical precision" recurs as descriptor rather than constraint; we never see her warm impulse war with methodical habit under pressure. Her arc from confusion to clarity feels declarative—"The fable was no longer one of absence, but of completion"—rather than earned through embodied choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to find quiet in chaos—but her interior experience remains abstract and label-driven ("profound connection," "fulfilled"). The mapkeeper role shapes perception (reading ice cracks) but micro-choices under pressure lack embodied contradiction; she moves through the task smoothly without visible internal friction or cost until the end. The final kneeling moment ("exhausted but fulfilled") tells emotional state rather than showing degraded thought or conflicted relief. Competence is high, struggle is declared more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to prove coincidences have meaning—but her interior life leans heavily on abstract formulation ("thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The retrocognitive visions provide texture but function as passive receipt of information rather than forcing trade-offs or mistakes. The final choice to align the prism feels inevitable given her skillset, with no visible path foreclosed or cost paid; she succeeds without meaningful struggle or renunciation. Embodied emotion is thin; the moment of success lacks physical specificity or a felt price that would anchor the change.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The archivist's motivation ("to sculpt identity from experience") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. "Preemptively nostalgic" appears as a label without constraining on-page choices—he moves from monument to monument without genuine friction between desires. The final epiphany ("identity wasn't carved from solitary events, but from this shared reservoir") lands as an unearned declaration rather than emerging from embodied struggle. Internal voice remains coherent but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian remains a stock "wandering artist" with stated rather than embodied motivation. His interior consists of declarative mood labels ("serious playfulness," "defiance") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic choice—lighting the fireworks—feels inevitable from the outset rather than earned through on-page pressure that forecloses another path. No visible cost or renunciation shapes the ending; he simply executes a plan and walks away lighter.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's trait of "warmly observant" is embodied through her attention to tidal pools and peripheral details, and her final choice to leave is contextualized through this lens. However, interiority often defaults to abstraction—"texture of time," "overlapping layers"—rather than concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. The internal conflict between staying with Kael and leaving never manifests as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; instead we get contemplative distance. Kael remains underdeveloped, a cipher whose "fear of change" is told rather than dramatized through competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and pursuit of silence remain internally consistent, and her decision to ascend is grounded in established desire. The porcelain doll provides embodied comfort across beats. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summary interiority ("felt something sprout," "defined her entire quest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment of peace lacks visible cost beyond the return journey—no felt sacrifice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is stated but never dramatized through a choice with cost. Her actions—humming, monitoring the vial, drifting—proceed without internal conflict or competing impulses. The "fluidly logical" trait is merely a label; no scene shows her reasoning constrain or enable a specific choice. Emotional states are abstract ("deep satisfaction") rather than embodied, and the piece offers no visible cost or renunciation that would earn the transformation it claims.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is introduced with a clear mission but remains largely functional across ~800 words. Her "wisely adventurous" trait is labeled rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses; she encounters obstacles that dissolve without meaningful resistance or cost. The final throne-claiming moment declares knowledge flowing into her rather than showing an embodied transformation or foreclosed path. Interior life is generic ("heart heavy," "heart pounding") and motivations are told rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper's interiority is poetic but abstract—"loaded emptiness" and "teach suffocating to breathe" read as theme labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure; the encounter unfolds passively with the keeper observing resonance and then inviting the visitor. The closing "practiced breathing together" offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the keeper's isolation expands without friction, undercutting the stakes of his severance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's motivation to "translate pressure into diamonds" is stated but never dramatized through micro-choices under live pressure. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is mentioned twice but never constrains an on-page decision with visible cost. Interior life is thin—the peak transformation moment ("he didn't fight the pressure but instead focused his will") tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. The final smile declares emotional resolution without embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is abstract and unembodied throughout; we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Lines like "his muse deepening with each passing moment" and "eloquently silent" remain label-only without grounding in concrete perception or micro-choice under pressure. The revelation that he was manipulated arrives via summary rather than dramatized discovery, and the final transformation ("dynasty ender had become a dynasty healer") is asserted without visible cost or foreclosed path. Therapy-speak pervades peak moments without earning the insight through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Sir Alaric's interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical language ("capture the shape of possibility," "serve the unseen") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by a competing want or fear that would force a difficult trade-off. The "murmured allegiance" and "shivering bliss" read as labels rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation ("no longer felt withdrawn") is asserted without prior causality showing what specific cost or renunciation earned the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" is clear and her heartbreak established, but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven ("tactfully hopeful demeanor," "fragile hope"). The archivist performs research actions competently but without visible internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure—she moves through discovery beats smoothly rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The final "sense of peace" arrives as summary rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a live option with visible cost. Her professional competence (dust-pattern reading, cross-referencing) never encounters friction or mistake that would reveal genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael remains a surface construct—"carefully resourceful" and "quiet archivist" are labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. His internal experience is externalized through stock phrasing ("surge of coded freedom," "felt desperation creeping in") rather than embodied perception. The climax at the phone booth involves no visible trade-off orforfeited path; he simply records voices and returns empowered. Motivation is declared but never tested by competing goods or unavoidable harms on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's duty is clearly established and his method of "negative space" music demonstrates specific professional competence, but his interiority remains abstract—phrases like "eerie nostalgia" and "vested hush" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The character performs his ritual without meaningful internal conflict or tension between competing impulses; he simply executes his task and leaves. No visible cost or choice forecloses a path; the prophecy will return, and he will return, creating a static loop rather than character evolution. The final renunciation ("he knew he would return, again and again") reads as duty accepted rather than a path foreclosed with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains an abstract symbolic figure rather than a character with embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Her transformation is stated repeatedly ("emerged transformed always") but never rendered as a felt choice with visible cost—we're told she becomes a guardian and teacher, but no on-page decision forecloses a path or reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. The repeated phrase "emerged transformed always" functions as a label, not a dramatized internal shift, and her motivations expand from curiosity to sacred duty without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's initial unease and yearning for change feel genuine, but her transformation reads primarily through summary reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final state ("befriended uncertainty") is told rather than shown through a choice with visible cost at closure. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("heart full of questions," "uncertainly certain") without sufficient embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior landscape is vivid and embodied ("her balance, usually as steady as her scales, felt precarious"), and her contradiction between professional pride and existential doubt drives the quest for meaning. The exploration moves through concrete actions—igniting flame, channeling energy, mixing gold—that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, the final shift to understanding feels more asserted than earned; the kintsugi meditation delivers an epiphany ("to name something was to define its limits, but to accept its brokenness was to redeem it") that reads as thematic closure rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Lysander remains an absence rather than a person, which is intentional but limits the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is presented through consistent external description ("modestly fearless," "quiet bravery") but her internal life remains flat and label-driven. The soul-collector premise never generates contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; she executes her method without friction, cost, or surprise. Lyra's chuckle-to-laugh progression is mechanically narrated rather than earned through a dramatized choice that forecloses an alternate path. The ending recycles opening labels ("luminous ache," "modest fearlessness") as static decoration, not as evidence of change or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is vivid and body-anchored through proprioceptive enhancement, creating a specific perceptual signature. The motivation—discovering "the mathematics of mercy"—is present but remains abstract; his quest is asserted rather than tested through meaningful on-page choices that foreclose paths. The climactic realization ("mercy was the interruption of a cycle") arrives as epiphany without dramatic cost or sacrifice visible in the moment. Internal contradiction is minimal; he moves from panic to insight too smoothly given the trauma responses that dominate the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Her "intuition" and translator role are label-only traits; we see her observe Anya's vision but make no decision that forecloses a path or alters her situation. The lens fragment grows warm and she feels urgency, yet no internal contradiction or embodied struggle emerges—she simply watches, returns, and resolves to document. The final paragraph claims her work "made the world more whole," but this is assertion without dramatized trade-off or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's motivation to discover what ceilings hide is consistent, and his dual role as repairman-medium is internally coherent. However, the emotional arc remains largely flat—his "weightless burden" is labeled repeatedly without embodied contradiction or visible cost in his decisions. The ghost interactions feel passive; Leo listens and promises rather than facing a choice that forecloses a path. The closure moment (packing the barrel, feeling "quiet pride") asserts change without dramatizing the price or tension that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated but never tested against contradictory impulses or genuine obstacles in scene. The "desire born from watching time stretch and thin" remains abstract exposition rather than embodied stakes. Her decision to use the whisper unfolds without visible internal conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The ending shifts to weaver-custodian mode without dramatizing the cost of losing the library's stability through specific renunciations or embodied consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to reimagine the civilization is established, but her interior life remains abstract—"burnished sorrow" and "poetically inclined mind" function as labels rather than embodied contradictions. The experiment sequence shows goal-directed action, yet the emotional arc from failed revolutionary to fulfilled scholar feels too smooth, lacking the irrational friction or self-deception that would ground her transformation. The final museum visit gestures toward peace but doesn't dramatize what path she foreclosed or what specific want she sacrificed to arrive there.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's motivation is declared ("to reclaim the light stolen by midnight") but his interior life remains flat and generic throughout. The townsman scene attempts internal conflict via the covenant's test, but Elian's response is immediate and competent with no visible struggle or contradictory impulse. Emotions are labeled ("awe," "wonder") rather than embodied through perception or gesture. The final smile and "heart light" reads as summary reward rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find "where explanations failed" is coherent but the interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("hinged awakenings," "resonant hush") that reads more as thematic labeling than embodied experience. The psychometry reading delivers vivid images (men in oilskin, cave-ins, dark water) but the transition from terror to serene acceptance feels unexplained—no on-page struggle bridges the gap. The final choice to leave the compass is legible but arrives without visible internal conflict; the cost (leaving behind her quest for bottled petrichor) is stated rather than felt in contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's core motivation (reimagine work as dialogue with ghosts) is signaled early, but the emotional stakes remain abstract. The "perpetually learning" trait is stated repeatedly without visible contradiction or cost—she watches, absorbs, carves without struggle or mistake. The slide's projections guide her hands frictionlessly; no botched attempt, no tension between her vision and the wood's resistance, no moment where her learning hits a wall. The final sculpture emerges through intuitive flow rather than earned choices that foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "quietly driven" attribute remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final understanding feels delivered rather than earned through on-page struggle; she observes patterns and connects dots without meaningful internal conflict or cost that forecloses other paths. Interiority leans toward summary ("She reckoned with the silence of her own heart") and therapeutic framing ("umbral tenderness") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The children scene at the end offers no complication—they simply receive her wisdom without challenging her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to uncover truth is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her choices in the vision feel guided by plot convenience (the diary conveniently unlocks as she completes the cipher) rather than earned struggle. The woman-from-mist functions as an exposition device rather than applying genuine pressure. Interiority relies on abstract phrases like "profound sense of reverence" and "strange peace" instead of embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical positions ("rejected false comfort," "conceived a plan") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The piece tells us he is motivated but never dramatizes a micro-choice that reveals competing desires under pressure. The final paragraph claims he "found his place," but no on-page moment shows him wrestling with solitude versus community; the arc is summarized rather than earned through scene-level decisions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation to archive emotional patterns is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The childhood memory functions as a static flashback device rather than pressing against present choices. His reaction to the prophecy—"velvet disquiet"—reads as label-only emotion without specific physical manifestation or micro-choices that alter his stance. The final vow to "understand emotional patterns that could predict destiny" lands as an assertion rather than a choice forged under pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to discover the texture of borrowed time") reads as label-only poetry rather than a felt need that drives concrete choices. Her interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("wild serenity," "furious tranquility") that never lands in embodied sensation or contradiction under pressure. The peak choice—placing the acorn cap on the vortex—lacks internal conflict or visible cost; she simply executes a predetermined ritual. The "texture" epiphany ("smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone") arrives as convenient fulfillment rather than earned discovery through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "credibly curious" trait drives the bell choice, but her interior life remains thin—we see decisions without the embodied contradiction or struggle that would make them costly. The villagers' calm recognition feels convenient rather than earned through prior dramatization. The choice to use the bell lacks visible internal conflict or a moment where competing impulses act simultaneously; it reads as a pre-decided plan executed smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("spiritually curious," "flourishing stillness") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation "to find strength in vulnerability" is declared repeatedly but never tested through a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Emotional states are summarized in therapy-speak ("empathize with their solitude") instead of dramatized through concrete perception under pressure. No genuine internal conflict appears; the character arc is a smooth epiphany without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The recluse's "tranquilly perceptive" nature is label-only; no internal contradiction or choice-forfeiting moment dramatizes this trait under pressure. His motivation to preserve unspoken words is told rather than tested through competing desires. The opening of the stained glass box and ghost-watching involve passive observation, not decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. Embodied emotion is minimal—"heart pounding" appears once, then vanishes into declarative calm.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "understand the texture of time" remains abstract throughout; her interior life is summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The stranger Leo arrives late and resolves the plot through exposition rather than earned discovery. Emotions are labeled ("heart still," "joy") without specific physical anchors, and the ending grants epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed paths—she simply "felt woven into the very fabric of moments" after a conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interiority reads as contemplative and consistent, but his agency remains observational rather than dramatized under pressure. The interaction with the child offers warmth yet lacks internal contradiction or visible cost that would earn transformation. Motivation is stated ("to discover beauty in the incomplete") but never tested against a competing desire or fear. The embodied emotion is gentle throughout, never degrading under stress or forcing a hierarchy of values with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes clearly from diagnosis to legacy work, and the progression from physical weakening to spiritual peace reads credibly. However, interiority remains abstract—"brazen calm," "profound sense of peace"—without embodied contradiction or micro-hesitation under the terminal pressure. The stag's bow and birds nesting feel like external validation rather than internal struggle with cost. No competing impulse complicates her systematic approach; she moves through the work without friction between desire and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is established through labels (luminous skeptic, academically rebellious) rather than embodied contradictions. Her motivation is clear but articulated via exposition: "Driven by a need to understand the chemistry of homecoming" tells rather than dramatizes the internal pressure. The final "found her own way home" reads as a tidy epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost. Internal conflict is absent; she pursues her goal without genuine friction or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The coachman remains a static archetype throughout—his motivation is declared but never tested by internal contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure. The piece tells us he "honored the memory of the fallen" and felt "satisfied," but these are labels rather than embodied states that shift tactically. No micro-choices reveal competing impulses; he completes his task without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The dead-language attribute and bird-call understanding are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a decision or create friction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Baron's interior motivation is consistently embodied through the leaf, phonograph, and final walk, though his bloodhound past remains largely ornamental rather than shaping choices. The interiority reads as particular—"translate distance into closeness"—and the final decision to walk toward the coordinates carries visible cost (leaving sanctuary for wasteland). However, the emotional arc relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("wild hush," "tinted revelation") that occasionally substitutes for concrete contradictory impulses. The closure choice feels earned but the tension between competence (tracking skill) and struggle is underplayed; he decodes the riddle too smoothly without genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His choice to journey toward the star feels more like a logical next step than an earned sacrifice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority leans toward abstract self-reflection ("blessed pariah," "temporally stretched") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final decision arrives without internal friction or a credible on-page trade-off that would elevate characterization into the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's "chivalrous thief" archetype and "apprentice of wonder" motivation are stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. His actions at the summit—bowing, swapping pieces, placing the sundial lid—proceed without visible internal conflict or cost that would reveal character particulars. The "sacredly playful grace" remains a label; we never see him struggle or forfeit anything personal. Emotional states are asserted ("heart full of purpose," "profound connection") rather than embodied through specific sensory degradation or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's core motivation—to document small gestures—is declared but rarely tested in scene; her walking patterns and survivor guilt remain told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The "benevolently ruthless" trait is label-only; no on-page choice shows her discarding a narrative or destroying an illusion with visible cost. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The final "forgive" pattern and emotional release read as summary rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand "home" is present but remains abstract; her choices to use the feather and stone feel more inevitable than conflicted. Internal contradiction is thin—she moves from avoidance to acceptance without dramatized competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "painful remembering" is told rather than embodied through specific sensory breakdown or contradictory pulls during key beats. Emotional progression reads as a smooth upward arc rather than the messy, contradictory layering expected under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and drives the journey, but his interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("tempest of regret," "anxious guilt") rather than embodied contradiction. The final acceptance arrives through puzzle-solving rather than a genuine fork in values with visible cost. Productive fidgeting is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates friction. The arc reads as contemplative processing rather than a character under pressure making a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—to refract truth into multiplicity—but her interiority remains abstract and label-dependent ("innocently mischievous," "defiant artist"). The piece tells us she smiles and finds joy in unraveling rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Her choices (reciting poems) are repetitive rather than escalating through genuine internal conflict, and the final smile reads as static confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elian's motivation is stated clearly but interior contradiction never surfaces; he moves through the dive with single-minded focus and no competing impulses that act simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse—"heart pounding with dire enchantment" reads as label-only, and the acid's sting is mentioned but doesn't degrade perception or force micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final collapse feels like a punctuation mark rather than an earned transformation with visible cost that forecloses a path. Agency is present but the character reads more as a vehicle for the concept than a mind under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete sensory anchors (faded blue paint, salt-stung air), and her motivation to confront buried memory drives the cave journey. The final choice to leave the shell behind enacts visible cost—she walks away lighter, unburdened—but the epiphany ("nostalgia had been a cage") edges toward therapeutic label-speak without fully embodied struggle in the moment. Internal contradiction is present (clinging to memory vs. seeking peace) but could layer more viscerally under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior life relies heavily on abstract concepts ("vibrations of intent," "purifying intentions") rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's year-long absence and her refusal to believe him gone could generate genuine internal conflict, but the piece bypasses doubt or fear in favor of serene certainty. Her climactic whisper feels more like enacted metaphysics than a choice under pressure with visible cost. The final tears arrive as confirmation rather than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "navigate the geography of loss" remains abstract and declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The building action shows purposeful micro-choices, but interiority relies heavily on label-like phrases ("raw solace," "geography of loss") rather than embodied emotion. The final realization that "the voice had been her own all along" arrives as a tidy epiphany without prior dramatized self-deception or visible cost. Internal conflict is told through metaphor rather than shown through simultaneous, contradictory wants acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation (psychological safety from involuntary truth) is clear and her foraging profession is established, but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The ritual sequence shows deliberate choice under risk, earning the piece's lone meaningful micro-choice. Internal contradiction is absent; her rationality remains unchallenged by impulse or fear in dramatized form. The final stance—calm after occlusion—reads as achieved without visible struggle in the ending beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's eccentricity and isolation are clearly drawn, and his motivation to decode the stranger's mystery is established early. However, his character operates primarily through reflection and observation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final "choice" to write a letter feels like a graceful completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Interiority leans toward summary and label ("lonely need," "strange peace") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his final renunciation earned through the cavern journey, but interiority leans toward summarized emotion rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to step back from the doorway reads as rational acceptance without embodied hesitation or competing desires dramatized in real time. "He understood that some promises are kept not by changing what was, but by embracing what is" arrives as insight-summary rather than felt discovery through micro-choices. The lingering promise functions more as thematic frame than visceral driver that complicates choice at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but remains abstract throughout; her "disenchantment" and the bleeding starlight dreams are told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The climactic moment in the grotto offers a revelation that feels delivered by narrative voice rather than earned through her micro-choices under pressure. Interior monologue relies on stock phrasing ("weight of her crown feeling like a cage") and the final transformation from disenchanted to guardian lacks visible struggle or felt cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("capture the density of presence") remains abstract and never translates into concrete choices with visible trade-offs. Her "scientifically romantic" trait is asserted through label rather than dramatized through action—no moment shows her weighing empirical rigor against wonder. The "revalue" arc is told rather than shown; her internal shift is declared ("she must first revalue herself") without embodied contradiction or struggle. Kael's presence anchors spatially but exerts no genuine pressure; his secret reframes context yet Elara's response is immediate acceptance rather than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"feral nostalgia had me in its jaws, shaking me like a rag doll" embodies rather than labels. The jealousy of past selves is grounded in specific images (thirty-year-old planting a tree, knowing the marriage will crumble), creating genuine internal contradiction. However, the final turn to "quiet…soar, inside my chest" feels somewhat asserted rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose options; the cost of chronicling is articulated but the renunciation or stance crystallization remains diffuse. Motivation is present and intensifies, but the ending resolves tension through summary reflection rather than a decisive micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is abstract and never tested by concrete stakes. Her interiority consists of thematic labels ("ordinary miracles," "occluded views") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The elderly repairman delivers exposition but applies no dramatic friction. The final "shift" is asserted, not earned through on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform scars into stories is clearly stated, but her interior journey remains abstract and summary-level. The piece tells us about crystallization and shedding rather than embodying contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice—completing the ceremony and exhaling—feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle, and the "crystallized doubts" metaphor substitutes for concrete emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's profession is established and her method is concrete, but her interior life remains thin—we see technique without meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ghost reconciliation unfolds more as procedure than as a choice that costs her something personally. Alistair's apology moment has embodied sorrow, but Isabella's response via petal-dew feels convenient rather than earned through prior character pressure. The final line's "ethereal grit" claim tells rather than shows a toll on Elara's psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The "end of history witness" remains a labeled abstraction throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses in scene, no micro-choices under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists entirely of thematic summary ("His motivation was to unravel cosmic illusions") rather than character-particular thought. The final "smile" arrives unearned by prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. The piece reads as allegorical tableau rather than dramatized human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The shepherd's motivation to understand time's substance is stated but never tested against a conflicting want or cost. His "insight" that clocks measure resistance arrives as assertion in the final third without prior dramatized friction. Interior voice relies on therapy-speak abstractions ("sharp edges of doubt," "desire to carve permanence from flux") rather than embodied contradiction. The mantle clock key shifts from control tool to metaphor without an on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early ("widen perspectives responsibly") but her interior life relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The father exists primarily as backstory and symbol; his journal appears late without prior setup. Agency at closure—deciding to teach—feels summarized rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Label-heavy interiority ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions") substitutes for character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("cultivated estrangement," "teach endings how to begin") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Elara's grief is told through summary ("crying, her words tumbling out about a life she was losing") without concrete embodied detail or micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The protagonist functions primarily as a facilitator-mirror rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Leo's backstory mention ("He had once been like Elara") arrives too late and remains summary-only, failing to anchor present stakes or alter a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to preserve the weight of small moments") is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice with visible cost. Her actions proceed without friction: she soaks the locket, writes in her ledger, and the covenant regenerates without obstacle or sacrifice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("haunted euphoria," "bittersweet triumph") rather than embodied contradiction, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals her values. The grandmother's rescue exists only as backstory summary; Elara herself makes no decision that forecloses a path or demonstrates internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains largely summary-level ("diagnosed loneliness," "desperately jocular") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Leo's arrival and his agreement to listen read as passive compliance rather than a choice with cost. The final paragraph asserts that her "desperately jocular facade" softens, but this transformation is told, not dramatized through scene work or a foregrounding moment that costs something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (grief navigation) is established and embodied through her dowsing quest, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—"vast, unmapped sea" and "transforming chaotic storm into structured composition" read as elevated metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final acceptance moment lacks visible micro-choices that would foreclose a path with felt cost; she kneels, pours intention, and finds her way without dramatized struggle or trade-off. Interiority stays consistent and grief-driven, but the closure renunciation feels declared rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "thresh meaning" from failure is clear and drives the signal responses, but interior contradiction is largely told rather than embodied—"confidently uncertain" reads as a label applied rather than two impulses warring in scene. The pen-tracing moment and trembling hands provide some embodied emotion, but peak beats lean on abstract self-awareness ("accepting that some truths are only visible when reflected through the lens of others"). The final choice to send the synthesis signal feels earned by prior causality, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's isolation is established, but his interiority remains thin—emotion is labeled ("joyful sorrow") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The advisor's motivation and the relational dynamic lack friction; both characters converge on shared understanding without visible cost or internal conflict. The final choice (clutching the camera, leaving) feels more like thematic closure than an earned shift driven by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kaelen's transformation from arsonist to preserver is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "analytically intuitive" nature remains label-only; we never see him intuit hidden meanings under pressure with visible cost. The vandalized portrait insight arrives as convenient epiphany rather than emerging from established character limits. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("volcanic tenderness," "desperate need to cleanse") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "experimental treatment guinea pig" status is declared but her interior life remains abstract—entangled memories are told as concept ("a soldier's terror," "a lover's kiss") rather than shown through embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The drumming is labeled "her cipher" and "quiet rebellion," yet no on-page moment reveals her weighing cost or altering tactics; she simply drums and the garden responds. Motivation is asserted ("breathe life into a shared dream") without friction between want and fear, and the ending's "fragile sense of triumph" lacks visible forfeiture or a path foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's unique walk-identification trait is introduced but used only twice (Kael, dockworkers) without meaningful cost or contradiction. Her motivation—proving whispers travel farther—is declared but not meaningfully tested by a choice that forecloses an option; Kael follows her without her facing doubt or paying a visible price. Internal contradiction is absent; she remains uniformly calm and correct. Embodied emotion is sparse; her smile and whisper are performed gestures rather than physiological states under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to teach the encroaching darkness the value of stars") but never tested by a conflicting impulse or cost on the page. Her actions—adjusting shutters, angling a mirror—proceed without friction, mistake, or trade-off; the child's spirit softens offstage with no dramatized resistance. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels: "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "silent empathy" repeat without embodied contradiction or specific sensory grounding. The final release ("a release of tension that left only a profound, spiraling calm") summarizes emotional change rather than showing a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("plant forests of second thoughts") but never tested by genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her choices feel illustrative rather than character-driven—organizing displays, retrieving the chess set—without visible cost or trade-offs. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("unspoken words," "tapestry of unease") instead of embodied, particular emotion. The ending grants success without dramatizing struggle or renunciation, leaving her arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are established early—guarded heart, desire for freedom—but the internal contradiction needed for high scores is largely abstract. The "combative tenderness" is told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The walk to the island feels more like yielding to external summons than a choice forged from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The scrimshaw dissolving registers as poetic closure but the cost of leaving behind her life feels asserted rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's blank-faced compliance and secret carving of sorrow symbols establish moral ambiguity, but her interiority consists almost entirely of narrated performance rather than embodied contradiction. The reporting of neighbors is mentioned once without dramatized weight or visible cost in a choice moment. Emotional states are labeled ("emotional void," "dense grief") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The whittling and narration feel like static ritual rather than micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cloud-shadow poet remains abstract throughout—"aesthetically driven soul" and "agent of transformation" are labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is declared ("to stride through boundaries once thought sacred") but never tested by a competing want or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The "tremor of certainty" arriving as insight lacks embodied struggle; no micro-choice forces a visible trade-off. The final walk-away feels unearned because no path was foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation to "awaken his sight" is clear but remains abstract; his renunciation of color-fixation for form appreciation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The "innocently cunning" trait appears as a label when he carries the broken concertina but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. Maestra functions more as a magical dispenser than a character under pressure, with no internal conflict or embodied reaction beyond serene gestures. The final epiphany—"beauty lies not in perfection"—reads as summary rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to discover connection through sound is established early and her "powerfully gentle" nature appears repeatedly, but the attribute functions primarily as ornamental labeling rather than constraining choices with visible cost. The shift from isolation to "channeling the prism-song outward" demonstrates agency, but the key insight arrives through contemplation rather than a dilemma that forces contradictory impulses to collide. Internal conflict remains conceptual; the "frustration" is mentioned but never dramatized as a choice between competing goods. The ending gesture—assembling the symphony—reads as culmination rather than renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's journey from grief to healing is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract label-speak ("subdued ardor," "quiet but fierce determination") without embodied contradiction or on-page struggle. The protagonist receives transformative objects passively (origami figures appear; she follows) rather than making choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The ending woman's moment reads as testimony to Elara's success but lacks the protagonist's own contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through conflicting impulses. Her "steadily curious" nature remains a label rather than a trait that constrains choices under pressure. The confiding to Leo is pure exposition dump—"I've seen a pattern emerging"—without embodied tension or micro-choices that alter present options. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending declares transformation without dramatizing the struggle that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "anguished joy" is asserted via therapy-speak labels ("transcendent joy," "anguished joy") rather than embodied through action or contradictory micro-choices. The final collapse reads as externalized exhaustion without visible internal cost foreclosing a path. No genuine flawed decision or renunciation emerges on the page; she succeeds without visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final "luminous regret" arrives as abstract philosophizing ("she wondered if it could still be called hope at all") without embodied cost or a visible foreclosure of options. The river stone functions as symbolic décor rather than constraining choice. Internal conflict is summarized ("her heart full of a beautiful, sorrowful light") instead of shown through competing wants acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to balance self-respect and compassion is established, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The "shedding layers" sequence reads more as contemplative summary than moment-to-moment struggle under pressure. Her decision to help the chameleon heal rather than reattach the tail is earned, but the path lacks micro-choices that expose competing impulses in real time. The closing stance is credible but arrives through reflection rather than dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("closure seeker who only opened wounds"), with embodied emotion in his restless picking at the bandage. The telepathic-plant trait generates micro-choices (using roots to tunnel) that reveal priorities under pressure. However, the final acceptance ("he found the closure he had always sought") reads as a tidy epiphany without the contradictory impulses or visible cost that would earn higher bands; the arc feels declared rather than dramatized in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is declared but never tested by conflicting impulses or visible cost. Her psychometry reading produces a vision that she passively receives; no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The final "promise to all the unheard goodbyes" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("spatial dimensions of memory," "emotional cartography") rather than embodied, character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to free trapped creativity is declared but never tested through on-page choices with competing costs. Her interiority consists of label-only feelings ("shadowed rapture," "profound longing") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "transformation" from dreamer to bard occurs via summary assertion rather than earned agency; no visible action or renunciation forecloses a path. Internal conflict is absent—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interior is abstract label-speak ("hollowed-out shell," "dreamless nature") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to "cultivate sparks" is told and generic; no micro-choices reveal competing impulses under pressure. The ending pivot—"did not guard against dreams but welcomed them"—lacks prior causality showing what forecloses the dreamless state. Agency reads passive: she performs cultivation without visible trade-offs or mistakes that compound.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("rediscover the wild frontier of her own mind") but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible trade-offs. Her emotions remain abstract—"the hum of insight," "promising revelation"—without embodied particulars or stress-specific degradation. The translocation and gear-finding are conveniences that advance plot without foreclosing paths or creating micro-choices under pressure. The final "unlocking" reads as a told epiphany rather than a decision earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's journey from constraint to agency is visible through the broken leash image and her choice to follow the guides, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("quiet hum," "unused courage") rather than embodied contradiction. The guides remain thematic figures without distinct pressure or choices that test Elara's values in conflicting directions. The star-stamp moment offers a concrete beat, yet the epiphany about courage being "in the journey itself" arrives as gentle realization rather than hard-won through dramatized stakes. The ending stance feels earned by accumulation but lacks a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path with sharp cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to understand the cost of safety is clear and consistent, driving his investigative actions through the archives. His internal state during nerve regeneration provides embodied grounding. However, the character remains largely observational; his final "resolve" to remain and bear witness feels asserted rather than tested by a difficult choice with visible cost. The piece tells us he "refused to pardon" the silence but never dramatizes what that refusal forecloses or risks on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lorian's motivation is clear and sustained, but his interiority remains abstract—"weight of epochs in his eyes" and "diminutive titan" are labels rather than embodied contradictions. The climactic confrontation with Theron reads as a set-piece reversal without prior dramatic friction between them; Lorian's calm declaration feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal struggle. The final choice (activating the rune) is motivated by his goal, but the emotional stakes lack embodied cost—no hesitation, no bodily manifestation of the decision's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in the bleaching trauma, but interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("drifting," "mooring") rather than embodied contradiction. The tapping method is introduced as characterization but functions more as décor than a pressure-driven compulsion. The "delayed revelation" moment reads as intellectual summation rather than earned discovery through concrete struggle; the shift from doubt to hope arrives via data correlation, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal experience remains largely explanatory rather than dramatized under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interior life is present but thin—her "awkward confidence" is told more than enacted through contradictory impulses. The transformation from observer to agent lacks friction; she steps into the stone circle and the surge of purpose arrives fully formed without visible cost or genuine struggle. Motivation ("discover meaning in the mess") remains abstract and never dramatized through on-page micro-choices that force trade-offs. Emotional progression reads as declarative rather than embodied: "solidified into unwavering purpose" tells us the change without showing contradictory pulls in action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "evolve tradition with intent" is present but operates more as told philosophy than embodied contradiction. Her plant telepathy functions as a convenient solution rather than a trait that creates genuine dilemmas or costs—she extends it effortlessly to decode destiny without struggle or tradeoff. The council shift from skeptical to agreeable happens off-page in summary ("The council, once skeptical, listened"), undercutting what should be a pivotal relational pressure point. Internal conflict is asserted through labels like "chafed" and "insurgent" rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her somatic-awareness method is consistent, but interiority leans heavily on therapeutic vocabulary ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") that reads diagnostic rather than embodied. The final grafting action offers symbolic closure, yet the path from freeze to thaw feels more told than dramatically compelled by contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices (pruning, smoothing the photograph, whispering names) are present but lack visible cost that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority remains consistently abstract and philosophical throughout, with thoughts that read more as theme statements than embodied crisis ("Why had he ever believed he could capture the truth…"). The "untangling threads" progression structures clear micro-choices (examining the mayor's daughter memory, the patron's rage), but the emotional register stays elevated and distanced even at peak moments. The final shift from "crestfallen" to purposeful cartographer is declared rather than dramatically earned through a visible choice with immediate cost. Backstory dominates but anchors to the present tarot cards; the reflection doesn't flatten pressure, so no BRR penalty or cross-cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to understand time dilation is stated early, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("consciously wild," "serene anger") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization—that time slows as "mental clarity, a survival mechanism"—arrives as告知 epiphany without prior dramatized struggle or micro-choices that test his commitment. The character reads more as a vessel for the concept than a person with genuine internal conflict; his "acceptance" at the end lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to expose genocide is signaled early, but her internal conflict ("bravely conflicted") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The vanished archivists memory and her trembling fingers offer embodied detail, yet the decision to act feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final "strange peace" and shift from conflict to certainty reads as emotional summary rather than a credible progression with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's pacifist stance is declared but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Her "senselessly perceptive nature" and ability to "feel the emotions of the plants" read as label-only magic rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The wanderers arrive and depart without forcing any decision that would foreclose a path or reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is summarized ("she rejected his violence") rather than dramatized through simultaneous, contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's cool-headed trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His motivation remains abstract—catching the echo—without embodied cost or foreclosed paths until the very end. The "transliterating emotions into physical vibrations" attribute is described but never dramatizes a trade-off or mistake that compounds pressure. Interior texture relies on stock fantasy-quest phrasing rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover truth is clear and her devotedly observant trait shapes her investigative method. Her internal conflict between wanting her father innocent and needing to know the truth drives the archive scene effectively. However, the emotional progression feels overly smooth—the "cold fury" at the journalist's call doesn't complicate her methodical descent, and the final resolve arrives without visible struggle between inherited loyalty and truth-telling. The choice to publish feels determined rather than earned through on-page wrestling with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared but rarely tested through on-page choice under pressure. The guilt over abandoning her niece is told via letters and summary rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "translation" attribute remains a label without visible cost or trade-off shaping a key decision. Interiority relies on abstract constructions ("the weight lift," "sharp sting") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "whimsical" label is asserted but her interiority remains generic—"felt the need to interject, not with words, but with the language of her art" reads as scaffolding rather than embodied choice. Her socially perceptive nature is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or flawed judgment under pressure. The final smile is a told epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path; her goal ("discover meaning in the mess") is achieved through observation, not agency-driven sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The retrocognitive trap functions largely as told backstory rather than embodied constraint that forces micro-choices under pressure. The renaming feels declared rather than earned through visible cost; the "aberrant mercy" that loosens her visions arrives without dramatized struggle or forfeiture. Internal states are often summarized in elevated register ("profound, weary protection") rather than shown through embodied perception and contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early ("eternally encore-seeking") but remains static throughout; her choices (raising the coin, singing) feel procedural rather than rooted in contradictory impulses. The synesthetic gift is label-only—"tasting colors of dusk as tart citrus"—without constraining a single on-page decision or creating embodied friction. The final fulfillment ("a spirit fulfilled") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply performs successfully and fades, rendering the arc more wishful than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    Alex's motivation (retrieve Mara's memories) is clear and his affectionate skeptic trait appears, but internal contradiction is absent—he moves smoothly from doubt to determined action without simultaneous opposing impulses. The somatic marker method produces embodied sensation ("muscles relaxed or tensed"), yet the interiority often defaults to abstract phrasing ("strange urge," "willowglass hope") rather than character-particular texture. The final choice to show Mara the image carries stakes, but we never see him wrestle with fear of failure or cost during the process; the arc reads as linear accomplishment rather than earned struggle with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's interior life is almost entirely abstract self-narration ("I remained awake as a sensory map maker," "my purpose is to become the voice of the unknown") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The floating fossil triggers awe but no difficult trade-off or renunciation; Kaelen simply documents and follows. Emotional language defaults to stock labels ("wonder," "hope," "enlightening") without character-particular embodiment. The final claim of achieving the goal arrives through passive elevation rather than earned causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    The hourglass turner remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under genuine pressure. Her "quiet inspiration" is declared but never dramatized as a trait that constrains action or creates cost. The cataloging work unfolds without struggle or mistake; she simply succeeds, flattening any sense of internal conflict. The final "transformation" is told rather than earned through visible stakes or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear but interiority leans heavily on stock spy-thriller phrasing ("burned spy," "prudently daring") and poetic abstractions ("where unused courage waits") rather than embodied contradiction. The partnership with Anya adds a relationship under pressure, but her arc from "wary" to "courage fully awakened" reads as summary rather than dramatized struggle. Wound and sacrifice at the end provide cost, but the emotional progression feels mechanically staged rather than grounded in micro-choices that reveal competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The coachman's interiority is heavily reflective and abstract rather than embodied in present pressure. The motivation "to distill complexity into essence" reads as label rather than conflicted action; no on-page choice forces a trade-off between wants. Memories "percolate" but do not alter present stance until the final beat, where forgiveness arrives cleanly without visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal contradiction is absent; the character moves smoothly from guilt to resolve without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority relies heavily on meditative observation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. His "phototropic to kindness" trait remains label-only until the vision sequence, where he watches rather than chooses. The final gesture of holding the lantern glass aloft feels unearned—no prior micro-choices dramatize the cost of becoming "a participant in this eternal now." Embodied emotion is largely absent; tears are noted but not felt through contradictory sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's wistfully pragmatic nature is presented but not contradictory in scene; her interior states lean toward label-driven reflection ("protected vulnerability," "instilling light") rather than embodied tension. The micro-choices—untying the boat, angling the mirror—lack visible cost or meaningful foreclosure. The rosebud discovery at the end offers symbolic renewal but feels externally bestowed rather than earned through conflicted agency.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared (translate isolation into independence) but her interior remains abstract and label-driven ("raw and unsettled," "profound isolation"). The reincarnation memory surfaces "only days prior" yet her emotional progression feels summary-only, moving from isolation to peace without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final smile and declaration of peace read as unearned epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("ghost of her former life," "brittle awakening") that never particularizes her thought patterns under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's profession as ghostwriter and her motivation to "rejoin" remain abstract; the piece tells us she "felt she had lost" something but never dramatizes the loss or what she's returning to. Her "whimsical" trait is asserted ("inevitably whimsical, seeing patterns") but not shown constraining a choice. The kneeling revelation—"vulnerability itself"—reads as a delivered epiphany rather than one earned through on-page struggle with contradictory impulses. The move from ghostwriter to public artist happens without visible cost or renunciation of her prior mode.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation (outwit cosmic tricksters) is clear and drives the central choice to broadcast the counter-signal, though his interior remains somewhat thin—we see determination but little contradictory impulse under pressure. The relationship with Dr. Evans functions adequately as external pressure but lacks genuine status friction; her shift from fury to respect feels unearned by prior causality. Embodied emotion is present in isolated gestures (weary eyes, steadying breath) but the peak broadcast moment leans on stock interiority ("wave of relief, tentative and fragile") rather than character-particular perception. The final stance—guardian in the static—forecloses the path of caution with visible cost (career risk), meeting the length requirement, but the turn lacks the contradictory layering that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's claustrophobia is labeled frequently but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she simply "presses on" without visible internal friction. Her "prudently adventurous" nature and "wistful rebellion" remain abstractions; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The keeper's sudden appearance and explanation replaces earned discovery, and Elara's transformation is asserted in summary ("eternally transformed") rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Motivation is declared but not tested in conflicting pulls.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's face-blindness is well-integrated as a perceptual constraint that shapes her methodology (measuring features, noticing shoulders and gait). Her motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" drives her to the quarry, but the peak realization—that the ribbon reveals a relationship rather than an identity—feels more narrated than earned through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final "hope to awaken empathy" reads as abstract goal-restatement rather than a visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal contradiction is present (compulsion she "barely understood"), but the climactic insight arrives via summary rather than a choice that alters her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but not dramatized under pressure—her "nervously confident" trait appears as label only without embodied contradiction. The ancestor's story dominates via backstory dump rather than present choice; Roy exists solely to grant access without applying meaningful resistance. Internal experience remains thin: we're told about "spongey dread" and "frantic energy" but never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias remains a collection of ornamental labels rather than a dramatized consciousness. "Dynamically observant" is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates a visible tradeoff; his "recounting" is passive narration dressed as action. The hitchhiker exists only in summary, denying any relational crucible. The final "transformation" from despair to wonder arrives via declaration ("no longer haunted, but illuminated") without embodied cost or contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's motivation is signaled early and his internal contradiction between inheritance and escape is present, but the squatter encounter feels engineered rather than organically discovered. The father's territorial markers serve plot convenience more than Leo's embodied choice-making. The final renunciation lacks visible cost on the page—Leo simply "steps onto a new path" without forfeiting anything concrete or facing a genuine pull to stay. Interiority tilts toward abstract philosophizing ("they do so because we carry our past within us") rather than lived contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared (promise to mentor, desire to help others) but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels—"shared burdens," "midnight solace," "healing with words"—rather than embodied, character-particular perception. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the "understanding dawned" moment arrives without dramatic struggle or trade-off. Emotional progression is smooth and therapeutic rather than contradictory or irrational under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a label-only protagonist whose "guarded" trait is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies on abstract summary ("her emotions locked away like seeds in winter") rather than embodied perception that would reveal character-specific ways of processing stress. The climactic moment—pressing the seed against ice—lacks genuine struggle or visible cost; she simply "wills" success without foreclosing any live option. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending declares her guardedness has "unbent" without showing the internal contradiction or price that would make transformation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to find the intersection of dreams") is abstract and remains largely label-only; her "purposefully curious" trait appears as description rather than driving contradictory on-page choices. The root-binding provides embodied constraint, and the final loosening carries visible cost, but the journey relies heavily on summary ("her curiosity fulfilled yet forever burning") rather than dramatized internal conflict. Interiority leans toward elevated, therapeutic register ("anxious elation," "weaving threads of memory and vision") that flattens rather than sharpens her particular way of processing crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("patch holes in her soul") is clear and drives her journey through the orchard, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—the reckless idealist label doesn't generate specific on-page tension between competing impulses. The keeper's appearance forces a micro-choice (shifting from dominance to surrender), though the transition feels more told than embodied. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("voids left by years of poor choices") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure. The final acceptance carries some weight, but the path from "reckless intensity" to "quiet healing" lacks visible struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's motivation is clear and the confidently uncertain trait is shown through appraisal expertise versus internal doubt. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("echo valley longing," "hollow quiet") rather than embodied contradiction. The closing choice to combine roadie knowledge with appraisal work emerges quickly after Mara's prompt rather than through sustained internal wrestling. The speaker grille cloth functions more as symbolic talisman than a constraint that forces visible tradeoffs in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent—he seeks to understand spiritual transition physics—but interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing ("haunted ambitions," "kindly methodical") that functions as label rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist's choices are present (placing the seed, tracing imaginary cuneiform, reestablishing the lattice) but feel more like deliberate steps in a tutorial than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Emotional progression is tidy: "haunted by fear of inadequacy" transforms cleanly to "purified" wisdom without the messy irrationality or self-deception that marks genuine struggle. The final transformation—"never be haunted again"—reads as declarative closure rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's motivation to "preserve wonder" is stated but never internally contradicted or tested by a choice that costs him anything. His actions are serene observations and ritual completion without hesitation, fear, or competing impulse. The "identities" he tends remain abstract vessels; we never see him struggle with one that resists his method or forces a sacrifice. Interiority consists of poetic assertions ("You are both storm and calm") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's interior life is conveyed primarily through summary ("he felt compelled," "tears welled") rather than embodied contradiction. The turn from bunker inspector to advocate for hope is declared via epiphany ("his motivation became clear") without prior friction between competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final decision to include hope in reports reads as therapeutic self-awareness rather than a choice forged under pressure with visible cost. No relationship crucible on the page; the confessions are static voices, not dynamic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (self-forgiveness) is clear and her journey shows embodied grief through the accordion handling. However, the interiority leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene—"she had been blaming herself for the unavoidable" tells the insight rather than dramatizing cognitive friction. The graffiti epiphany arrives too cleanly without visible resistance or cost to acceptance. Stopping medication is mentioned but never constrains a choice or complicates her perception on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains externally motivated by a declared goal but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "cautious exuberance" is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The watch and cipher constrain tactics, but her micro-choices (documenting, measuring echoes) do not reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The journey feels like puzzle-solving without personal stakes that alter her internally by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's telepathy with plants and her central choice are present, but her internal conflict feels asserted rather than lived. The plants' "silent, green whispers" and "telepathic gratitude" remain atmospheric labels without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final decision to play the violin lacks embodied hesitation or visible cost in the moment; the "mulberry ache" is repeated as a poetic placeholder rather than a character-specific emotional signature that degrades under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or internal conflict. The piece relies on label-only interiority ("lucidly watchful," "sacred duty") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The infusion succeeds without friction, foreclosing no path and paying no visible cost. Emotional progression is absent; she completes the task and feels "profound completion" without dramatized struggle or earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through competing desires or contradictory impulses in scene. Her "kindly decisive" attribute functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choices under pressure. The epiphany about contentment arising from rebirth cycles is asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle; the hairpin's glow delivers insight without dramatic cost. Internal experience remains diagnostically self-aware ("hollow ache," "yearning for deeper understanding") and never degrades under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris is characterized through his professional role and philosophical stance ("sincerely insincere"), but internal contradiction never acts in scene—he remains smoothly detached throughout without embodied tension. Elara's shift from certainty to nuance is told through metaphor (cloak, mirror) rather than earned through concrete micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final moment—"her heart lighter for having embraced the gray areas"—reads as summary rather than dramatized cost. Interiority leans on abstract philosophical language ("vulnerability no longer fragile but protected") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested; her backwards aging is an ornamental trait that never constrains a choice. Kael exists as recipient, not agent—his "fear flickering" and gasping are told reactions without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that alter the lesson's path. The climactic "understanding" arrives as epiphany summary ("he understood then") without prior interiority building contradictory impulses. Interior voice is generic meditation-speak; neither character's perceptual signature is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to learn to navigate without moving") but never tested through contradictory impulses or meaningful choice under pressure. The "historically reverent" trait operates as label-only decoration; no on-page moment shows Elara sacrificing efficiency or comfort to honor the past. The final "shift" and "clarity" are asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and the protagonist remains passive—observing birds, humming a tone—without agency that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elian's motivation ("to find the sacred in the simple") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist's underachiever status is declared but never tested under pressure—no meaningful struggle or blind spot complicates his journey. The transformation from "underachieving mage" to teacher feels unearned, summarized across "the ages" rather than fought for on the page with visible cost. Interiority remains generic ("felt an urge," "realized") without embodied emotion or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation ("discover the color of sound") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His internal experience remains abstract; we never witness him struggling with competing desires or making a meaningful renunciation. The final "vow" and transformation feel unearned—no on-page cost forecloses a prior path. The characterization relies on summary exposition ("haunted by," "believed") without embodied micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "quiet enthusiasm" is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory action; her casting of coins feels ritualistic but lacks moment-to-moment stakes that test her resolve. The "stellar doubt" paragraph mentions internal conflict but it evaporates immediately without altering her next move. The final realization that "purpose was ever-present" reads as an unearned epiphany—no prior scene dramatizes the cost of doubt or the friction between preservation and futility. Interiority remains at a declarative, summary distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    The reaper's grief is omnipresent but never particularized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he moves smoothly through emotion without genuine friction. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("sorrow was a familiar weight," "distant intimacy") rather than embodied perception. The final acceptance arrives without visible struggle or trade-off—no on-page micro-choice that costs him something he values. Motivation is declared but never tested against competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's motivation is declared ("earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The cut finger moment gestures toward struggle but resolves instantly without altering tactics. Interior experience relies heavily on label-speak ("lukewarm talent," "tepid magic") instead of showing capability limits through failed attempts with visible cost. The final success feels unearned because no prior choice forecloses a path or demonstrates what his "brittle devotion" actually costs him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his actions consistent, but internal contradiction is absent—he moves smoothly from discovering photographs to community gathering without meaningful friction. The pivot from solitary guilt to collective storytelling feels unmotivated by on-page pressure; no moment forces him to choose between conflicting impulses. Emotions are largely told through labels ("profound satisfaction," "boyhood helplessness") rather than embodied through contradictory action. The change at closure—moving from guarding water to preserving heritage—is declared rather than dramatized through a costly micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's stated goal (harmonize logic and intuition) is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her "hesitation" and eventual warming gesture do not show genuine internal conflict or cost—she simply executes a successful technique. The sentimental backstory is label-only; no on-page micro-choice tests or reveals her secret sentimentality under pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("ached with memories," "emotion welled within her") and the final "transformation" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's solitary vigilance is established early, but her "attentively inventive" trait functions mostly as label rather than embodied contradiction. The muscle-memory action sequences tell rather than show internal conflict; we're assured she's anxious but her fingers move with "confidence her mind struggled to feel"—a neat summary that flattens the contradiction instead of letting competing impulses collide in real time. The parachute buckle receives symbolic weight ("a testament to resourcefulness") but her choice to tighten it carries no visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The final discovery validates her but doesn't dramatize a meaningful change or renunciation with on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's ego-death survivor status reads as a static label rather than a lived contradiction; his numbness is asserted repeatedly ("his numbness a fortress") without embodied micro-choices that show competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "spark" arrives through an external ritual rather than earned internal conflict, and the emotion-flood ("grief, joy, fear, and hope") deploys therapy-speak labels at the pivotal beat instead of specific perception. Rin and the faction representatives remain one-dimensional conveniences—grey-robed Archivists versus green-clad Vitalists—without distinct voice or status friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Conductor is a spectral archetype rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mournfully eager," "centuries of unshed tears") without embodied micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The motivation to restore laughter is declared but never tested by a competing want or on-page friction that would make the final choice costly. The ending dissolves him into mist without a visible renunciation or alteration earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guardian's interior state is established—dimensionally homesick, seeking to befriend uncertainty—but contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene. The final transformation ("became the mist, the light, the waiting") arrives as assertion rather than earned choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the piece favors abstract philosophical labels ("interiorizing exteriors," "foggy lucidity") over concrete micro-choices under pressure. The renunciation of the library lacks dramatized friction that would make the trade-off felt.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian is defined by declared traits ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("sharp, internal wound," "surge of defiance") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The climactic decision to "embrace creative destruction fully" reads as a conceptual epiphany rather than a choice forced by competing wants with visible cost. Emotional progression is overly tidy: fear → insight → resolution without credible irrationality or layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority reads as abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her "celestial signal interpreter" role is stated but never pressures a difficult choice; she performs a technical task with no visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The final "tuning her spirit" and similar phrases rely on therapy-speak metaphor instead of dramatized decision. No credible vulnerability or mistake shapes the arc; she succeeds through insight without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eli's "ardent deckhand" trait and "resiliently positive outlook" are asserted but remain label-only throughout; no on-page contradiction or cost tests these attributes under pressure. His interiority relies on stock metaphors ("burning need," "stubborn belief") and lacks embodied emotion or conflicted impulses at peak beats. The final choice to "align the patterns" materializes via external mechanics (hourglass + radio) rather than a visible internal trade-off, leaving the closure gesture unmotivated by prior struggle. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation "to discover the texture of connection" is declared but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority consists of abstract philosophical musings ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary constructs") rather than embodied contradiction. The weaving continues "methodically" through the eruption without visible struggle, fear, or cost that would reveal character under stress. The final realization that "she was the connection" reads as unearned epiphany rather than hard-won insight.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (learning celestial navigation) is clear and consistent, but her choices feel more pedagogical than pressured. The shift from disengaged Kael to fascinated student is telegraphed rather than earned through embodied struggle. Interiority leans abstract ("surge of purpose," "somber marvel settling deep") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization arrives as epiphany rather than through a micro-choice that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to protect vulnerable voices") is stated repeatedly but never tested by on-page conflict or internal contradiction. Her "persistently curious nature" and inherited role are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The character executes a ritual without obstacles, embodied emotion, or any moment where her values compete. Eleanor's ghost appears and tells her story, but Elara's reaction is generic assurance rather than character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to honor the unremembered is stated but never tested by an on-page conflict between competing goods. Her claustrophobia is mentioned three times yet never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it simply evaporates when convenient. The ghostly researchers materialize as reward rather than complication, and her "healing" is asserted in the final paragraph without embodied cost or visible forfeit. Interior voice relies on abstract labels ("swell of peace," "purpose clear") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand her catastrophic failure and her constant heartbeat counting are established early and consistently embodied. The transition from counting obsessively to final acceptance is earned through the ink-defragmentation sequence, with the porcelain shard materializing internal change. However, interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("graceful acceptance," "newfound clarity") that abstracts rather than dramatizes the shift. The digital ghost Kael functions more as narrative device than pressuring presence—his warnings and fears are shown through ink patterns but don't create genuine conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her patient observation of the starlings demonstrates consistent characterization. However, her interior life during the climactic diamond confrontation relies heavily on narrated emotion ("Desperation clawed at her") rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from fighting the curse to harmonizing with it feels stated rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal her internal hierarchy of values. Her copper veins glow but serve more as visual decoration than a constraint that shapes her decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aris's motivation—transforming bitterness into cosmic absurdity—is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. His "laughter" at confessions occurs off-stage; we're told he "weaved their pain into tales so ridiculous" without seeing the weaving or the internal struggle. The changed ones metamorphose wholesale without individual agency or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on abstract claims ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by internal conflict or competing desires. She moves through beats without embodied emotion—"felt despair," "smiled," "felt peace"—all label-only states. The locust shell discovery triggers a plan without dramatized hesitation or cost. The statues' awakening unfolds as convenient external response rather than protagonist struggle with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The "respectfully rebellious" trait functions as a label without generating visible tradeoffs in the single action depicted—placing the bottle in the drone. Interiority consists largely of abstract reflection ("finding where broken promises heal") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The piece tells us he has fostered unity for years but shows no on-page micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to interpret silence as possibility") is asserted in the opening but never tested through contradictory impulses or genuine resistance. His transition from silent work to singing feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page friction. The "quietly persistent" trait manifests as smooth competence without blind spots or costs that would complicate his choices. Interior life reads as poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early and her action (tracing hyperbolic curves) propels the climax, but her interiority leans abstract ("her mind navigating the intricate folds of negative curvature") rather than embodied. The "sanely eccentric" trait remains a label without constraining a difficult choice; her solitude is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final step through the doorway reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a renunciation or trade-off with visible cost, and the scarf's dissolution feels convenient rather than forfeiting something she needs.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to capture the dream is clear, but her interiority reads as label-heavy ("cipher of longing," "luminous absence") rather than embodied contradiction. The final recognition of her mother provides emotional clarity, yet the progression feels more like unveiling a hidden fact than wrestling with contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices under pressure are present (adjusting exposure, blending light) but these feel more like technique demonstrations than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elian remains a cipher throughout—motivation is stated ("to free an idea trapped behind fear") but never internalized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "unassumingly bold" trait is label-only; no on-page moment shows him negotiating risk versus caution with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("improbable longing," "pure, unshackled truth") rather than embodied sensation or character-particular thought. No meaningful change occurs; he walks away unchanged, already "turning toward the next hidden prison."

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established—recovering stolen memories—but her interior life leans heavily on label-speak ("chronically curious," "hands-on resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic memory recovery arrives without meaningful friction; she simply aligns mushrooms and the past floods back, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority during the peak beat remains descriptive rather than urgently felt: "the clarity of the recovered memory as sharp as the day it was formed" tells rather than enacts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's backwards-walking habit is embodied and recurring, but her interior reasoning for mentoring remains abstract rather than rooted in contradictory impulses. Elian's arc from anger to vulnerability follows a credible path, though the epiphany ("it's not about geography, but perception") arrives with minimal internal resistance. The final choice—leaving—feels earned by the lesson structure but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options on the page. Interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("heart a mix of stern duty and deep care") that dilutes character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is presented entirely through abstract labels ("wise," "insatiably creative") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivations are declared but never tested by a competing desire or blind spot that would create genuine internal friction. The climactic weaving sequence shows no meaningful choice—she simply performs a technique she's done before without visible cost, struggle, or trade-off. The final paragraph's "insatiable creativity was already brewing new ideas" reads as a therapy-speak tag rather than embodied character tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to ground spirits is declared but remains abstract; her choices (picking at knots, continuing despite danger) lack contradictory impulses or visible internal friction. Kael functions solely as audience surrogate with no pressure of his own. The "lucid unrest" is labeled repeatedly rather than embodied through perception or micro-choices that reveal competing desires under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation remains declarative rather than embodied—her "methodically curious nature" and "empathy for silence" are asserted labels that never constrain a choice. The story tells us she "felt a pull" and "allowed herself to feel the stories," but no on-page micro-choice reveals competing impulses or a hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is absent; she moves through beats in smooth analytical mode without ambiguity or genuine struggle. The final discovery feels convenient rather than earned by prior characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("understanding the physics of letting go") is present but never creates a live choice with visible cost—she observes, descends, finds artifacts, and ascends without contradiction or competing impulse. The final "vowing to release the ghosts she carried" is asserted, not earned through on-page trade-off; no prior beat shows her clinging costing her something concrete. Interiority defaults to label-level summary ("sophisticated melancholy," "quietly analytic") rather than embodied perception or micro-choice under pressure. The character functions as a receptor for theme rather than a contradictory agent whose flaws drive mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" remains abstract throughout; no on-page micro-choices reveal contradictory impulses or earned cost. The ghost in code connection feels declarative rather than dramatized through embodied action. Interiority relies heavily on label-like statements ("her motivation burned brightly") instead of concrete, character-particular perception. The final "smile" and emotional resolution arrive without visible renunciation or trade-off that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to seek out the joy beneath anguish") but remains largely abstract; the diary unlocking provides some micro-choices, yet her transformation at the summit reads as summary ("understanding that joy wasn't the absence of anguish") rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority leans toward label-only feelings ("heart swelled") and the final realization lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed. The captain exists only as text, so relationship pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to prove empty spaces remember is stated but never dramatized through conflicting wants or embodied struggle. His "quietly explosive" interior is asserted repeatedly ("quietly explosive tension," "quietly explosive realization," "quietly explosive joy") without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The catalog work unfolds as a series of labeled observations rather than choices under pressure that reveal character hierarchy. No meaningful cost or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's face blindness is character-particular and shapes her reliance on texture/scent during the search, but her motivation to "imprison the sky" reads abstract rather than viscerally rooted in contradictory impulses. The final acceptance ("learned to let it go") arrives without on-page struggle between her defiance and the sky's resistance; the renunciation feels asserted rather than earned through embodied micro-choices. Internal conflict operates as summary of her realization rather than simultaneous contradictory pressures in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "diligently curious" nature is established early and her observation-to-action arc is coherent, but her interior life reads generic—"heart raced," "trembling with excitement"—without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The captain remains functional but flat, present only to approve her work. The final shoulder-clap gesture attempts camaraderie but lands as a token beat rather than a crucible moment that alters their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to learn repair is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; her yearning remains abstract throughout. The discovery of the gear assortment and uncapping moment feel externally driven rather than emerging from internal conflict or embodied struggle. Interiority leans heavily on label-only feelings ("wistful ache," "renewed determination") without physical specificity or genuine friction between competing desires. The final understanding arrives as assertion—"She understood now"—without dramatized cost that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to follow the ghost's guidance is largely told rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices. The group dynamic reads generic ("ragged group of strangers who had become family") without individual tensions or status shifts visible in action. Jax's doubt ("We're following a ghost based on sidewalk scribbles") arrives late as a lone beat of internal conflict, then dissolves without cost. The ghost's altruism is asserted through summary ("Its altruism had never wavered") rather than dramatized through choices that reveal contradictory impulses or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her occupation established early, but her interior life defaults to elevated register ("bruised awe," "sacred offering") that reads as imposed rather than earned through embodied choice. The final smile is asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The "beautifully flawed" attribute remains label-only; scars are mentioned but never constrain a tactic or force a visible tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—stubborn need to guide vs. resentment—is clearly established and drives her rescue choices. Internal conflict is present but often stated rather than embodied; "motivation flared within her" and "feeling less like a burden" lean toward summary. The shift from reluctance to acceptance at closure is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices under pressure (timing the projections, ducking the bird) are present but emotional embodiment remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's grief and professional identity are established, but his emotional progression relies heavily on therapy-speak ("loosened grief," "symphony of regret") and on-the-nose articulation ("translate separation into connection"). The chrysalis moment and foam-tracing offer embodied beats, but the final transformation from grief to acceptance arrives through summary ("his grief, once a heavy weight, now felt loosened") rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (insistence vs. regret) but not active in scene; the resolution feels declared rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a cipher throughout: her motivation to "find the place where stories begin" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible stakes. The transformation from vendor to guide happens through abstract actions (tracing moonlight, stepping through a doorway) without embodied struggle or contradictory wants. Internal experience is summarized in generic epiphanies ("profound connection," "fragments integrating") that lack the specific embodiment required. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is declared ("needed to subsume this remorse") but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout. The story tells us he "let the emotions flow through him" and that he "worked methodically," yet we never witness contradictory impulses or embodied struggle—only narrated summary of his process. The final smile and declarative closure ("his work complete") lack the visible cost or foreclosed path required for earned change. Phrases like "emotionally contagious attribute" and "sturdy brittle resolve" read as diagnostic labels rather than lived experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is assigned traits ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetically decisive") but they function as labels rather than embodied contradictions. Her motivation to unite villages is declared in exposition rather than tested through on-page choices with cost. The three representatives arrive as functional tokens who point out features without distinct idiom or status friction. Internal conflict is absent; she guides smoothly without visible struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined entirely by abstract labels ("helix-minded," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") without concrete contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation is asserted through metaphysical exposition rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Interiority remains generic and philosophical throughout, using therapy-speak constructions ("synaptic plasticity," "neural changes") that distance rather than embody emotion. No genuine flaws complicate her journey; she executes her mystical task without mistake or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but her choices feel passive and inevitable rather than conflicted. The "prism-minded archivist" trait remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal experience is summarized through abstract concepts ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") rather than specific sensory embodiment under pressure. The final transformation is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to create music is clear and intensifies across the story, though her internal contradictions remain shallow—we see symphonic understanding but not the cost of silence on her personally until the final act. The empathy-in-motion practice is labeled more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is present ("her symphonically minded soul swelled") but leans toward stock phrasing. The final choice to play feels inevitable from her established traits, earning the change, but the journey lacks visible struggle or mistake that would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("to discover beauty in the difficult") but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice under pressure. His actions are largely passive observation and memory recall; the climactic stone-placement reads as ritual fulfillment rather than a decision with visible cost or foreclosed path. The "thoughtfully precise" trait is asserted but not demonstrated through contradictory impulses or tradeoffs. Internal conflict is absent; he experiences hopeful melancholy as a static mood rather than wrestling with competing desires in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined by labels ("eclectic pacifist") rather than embodied contradictions. Her interiority consists of abstract declarations about empathy and silence without competing impulses or genuine friction. The ending announces fulfillment and renewed commitment through summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's herbalist ambition and olfactory sensitivity are established early, but her interior contradiction remains abstract—ambition as "sharp thorn" is asserted rather than shown through simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene. The epiphany ("serenity wasn't found in stillness") arrives through summary reflection rather than emerging from a difficult on-page choice with visible cost. Her shift from frustration to calm feels declared rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and the final "smile" performs serenity without embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is signaled early but never tested by contradictory impulses—he moves through the story with unopposed clarity of purpose. The "discovery" at the cavern arrives as exposition via arrow-tip visions rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the stomach lurch is the only visceral marker in a journey that should carry physical and emotional cost. The ending secures knowledge without visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's professional interiority is present but largely label-driven ("hazy precision," "rapidly adapting") without embodied contradiction under pressure. His discovery of the patch produces a declarative emotional jolt ("sent a jolt through him") rather than layered, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to leave is framed as mission clarity rather than a renunciation with visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, tucking the patch) but remain observational rather than stakes-altering decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "certify wonder as essential" remains abstract throughout; her choices are ceremonial rather than conflicted. Synesthesia is label-only—colors and textures are declared but never constrain a beat or reveal internal contradiction. The climactic bell-ringing unfolds without struggle, cost, or renunciation; the amber simply dissolves on cue. No embodied emotion or micro-choice under pressure earns the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clearly established—harvesting insights from failure—but his internal journey lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. The piece tells us he "observed, seeking patterns" and "felt a shift, a culmination of understanding," but these realizations are summarized rather than dramatized through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final stance ("no longer driven solely by duty; he was guided by hard-won wisdom") reads as declared growth rather than earned through visible cost. Interiority remains abstract ("fear had clouded his judgment, how haste had undone his care") without specific, character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "understand the mathematics of emotion" is declared but her internal contradictions remain abstract. The "borrowed personalities" function as labels—widow's grief, child's joy, cartographer's loneliness, poet's passion—without embodied specificity or simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final moment ("she was herself again, no longer borrowing, but whole") reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through concrete, contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The mechanics of "transposed empathy" are told, not dramatized through action that reveals character limits.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's jitteriness is established early but remains a static label rather than evolving under pressure. The encounter with the traveler should test his motivation to "coax wonder," yet his internal shift from jittery to calm feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or micro-choices with visible cost. The absent mentor Elara functions as backstory decoration; her lessons are summarized but never force a present trade-off. The final vow feels like summary rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's internal state is label-heavy ("attentive mystic," "firmly grounded") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The frost-vision scene shows concrete sensory engagement, but her pivotal realization—that the prism absorbed her guilt—arrives as a declared epiphany without prior dramatized micro-choices that telegraph the underlying doubt. The final acceptance feels summarized ("allowing it to wash over her") rather than enacted through a visible on-page cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (reaching Liam) is clear and her final sacrifice is on the page, but her internal experience remains abstract throughout. The piece tells us she is "wistful" and feels the silence's "chill in her bones," yet these states are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The sacrifice itself—dissolving into threads—reads as a predetermined script rather than a decision forced by competing desires. Liam appears only in memory and the final beat, preventing any relational crucible that might test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian is defined by a single trait ("quietly determined") repeated throughout without internal contradiction or embodied pressure. The story tells us he is meek yet defiant, but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in a choice. Key moments—bartering the silk, learning the secret—are summarized rather than staged with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The "azure defiance" remains a label rather than a lived tension that costs him something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's motivation (the withheld truth) is clear and consistent, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory terminology ("murmur of dreams," "latent energy") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The climactic revelation—"crushing weight of a love so fierce it demanded sacrifice"—arrives as告summary rather than lived contradiction; we're told the sensation without witnessing Kaelen process conflicting impulses in scene. His micro-choices (touching the shard, raising it, focusing will) read as ritualistic steps rather than decisions that foreclose live options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's reticence is shown through concrete behavior ("more comfortable with the sea's whispers"), and his observant nature enables key choices. The motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" remains somewhat abstract despite the final gesture of leaving a note. Interior work is strongest when he handles the sea glass and builds the cairn; the confrontation with the "haunting presence" feels told rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. Cora's presence enriches backstory but remains off-page, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael remains opaque throughout; his motivation is declared ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The "laughing storm herald" descriptor is recycled without revealing character-specific perceptual filters or micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent—he moves through an "otherworldly routine" with robotic precision, no friction between wants and costs. The ending offers no earned change or credible endurance; he simply completes the task as foretold.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's motivation to "learn why some people magnetize stories" is abstract and never tested by concrete choices on the page. The heart transplant backstory consumes opening real estate but doesn't create internal contradiction or force a difficult trade-off—he simply observes light patterns and reaches a conclusion without visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("fervent curiosity," "blend of awe and wariness") rather than embodied perception. The final realization that he "had become a story himself" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered by narrator summary, not dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to discover what trees witness") reads as abstract quest rather than embodied need under pressure. Interior voice relies heavily on therapeutic framing ("quantified sorrow," "deconstruct," "burden") that feels diagnostic rather than lived. The healing attribute and dream-mapping method are declared but never constrain a choice with visible cost; she adjusts dials and traces lines without friction or failure. The final "lightening" arrives without dramatized struggle—sorrow dissolves because the text says it does, not because we witness her forfeit something concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her choices feel predetermined rather than discovered under pressure. The "scattered memory keeper" trait is told repeatedly but never complicates a decision—she simply proceeds through her task without internal contradiction or genuine doubt. The climax (singing, swaddling light) lacks embodied struggle; emotions are labeled ("courage," "yearning") rather than shown through contradictory impulses. No meaningful cost forecloses a path; the ending grants full restoration without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's compassion and empathy are asserted repeatedly but rarely embodied in contradictory action under pressure. The decision to attend and share her story feels pre-determined rather than wrestled from competing impulses. Her mistake (trusting a stranger) is told in summary without the texture of self-deception or visible internal conflict in the present moment. The elder's therapeutic framing and her tidy self-forgiveness read as label-speak rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal stance is consistently rendered through sensory and embodied detail (the bread as touchstone, heuristically gentle movements). The journal's discovery creates a meaningful external pressure, and her response—recognizing the gardener's parallel journey—feels earned. However, the final shift remains largely conceptual rather than enacted through a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice is strong but the arc reads more as recognition than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is stated ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") but never tested by conflicting wants or material cost. His "gently meticulous" trait appears as label and summary rather than driving a choice under pressure. The story provides a single continuous task without internal contradiction or a moment where his values force a trade-off. Emotional interiority remains abstract ("heart ached") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—capturing the sound of trust breaking via a magical watch fob—reads as whimsical abstraction rather than grounded human need, weakening the stakes throughout. Her "curiously steadfast" resolve is asserted repeatedly but never tested by internal contradiction or meaningful cost; she observes Silas rather than making choices that foreclose paths. The interiority relies heavily on stock phrases ("heart pounding a rhythm," "fear that prickled her spine") and the climax lands entirely off-stage through overheard voices, denying the protagonist agency at the decisive moment. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's luminous skepticism is stated but never concretely embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her "motivation" to learn why people carry weather is declared, yet when she meets the weather-man, she passively listens to his exposition rather than pursuing her goal through questions or tests. The final "realization" arrives via explanation rather than earned discovery through on-page struggle. Interior texture relies on filter verbs and abstract claims ("her skepticism wavering") instead of embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (uncork suppressed creativity), but her interior voice relies heavily on abstract labels—"ache of her current emptiness," "broken pieces of her confidence"—rather than embodied contradiction. The cave sequence provides micro-choices (lifting the canvas, sketching faces), yet the final shift ("a seal had been broken inside her chest") reads as declarative rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Mnemonic gift functions as a plot device (remembering the combination) without imposing visible cost or trade-off in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria's motivation is clearly stated but her interiority reads generic and over-explained ("memory of the oasis," "heart ache"). The wilting-leaves mechanism provides a concrete constraint that shapes her journey, but emotional progression is largely summarized rather than embodied. Internal conflict is minimal; she pursues her quest without meaningful contradiction or competing impulses that would raise the stakes of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is presented through labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she works in silence but would be tuning bells regardless. The "success" at the climax arrives without prior struggle or mistake; she simply fine-tunes and the symphony works, offering no earned transformation or renunciation. Interiority defaults to abstract claims ("her heart sang") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's interior is anchored in the "inner static" premise and his nostalgic drive, but embodied emotion is scarce—most internal experience is labeled ("fragmented wholeness," "strangely organic awareness") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The miniaturization plan and controlled burn are explained more than inhabited; we watch mechanics unfold without friction or micro-hesitation that would reveal values under pressure. The final walk offers resolution-by-assertion ("peaceful silence," "quiet joy") without visible cost forecloses a live path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to prove that listening heals") drives her investigation, but interiority remains declarative rather than contradictory—her listening unfolds without internal friction or doubt. Mr. Hemlock's grief is told through summary ("his eyes clouded with years of silence") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (unlocking the mailbox) arrives without visible cost to Elara; his transformation feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Secondary characters (Mrs. Gable, the baker) deliver exposition without applying immediate pressure that forces Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to encrypt her own vulnerability as strength") is declared rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. Her competence is total—she dances, decodes, and liberates without visible struggle or cost—resulting in a functionally invincible protagonist. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through the mission with serene confidence that never wavers or forces a trade-off. The subjects she liberates register no agency or complication, reducing them to inert props.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find deleted memories is clear and sustained, driving her choices from coffee-grounds divination through exhumation to acceptance. Interiority relies heavily on summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene: "she made peace with the pain" tells resolution instead of showing conflicting desires clash. The letters reveal a deliberate self-forgetting, which adds complexity, but the final emotional arc resolves too tidily without visible struggle in the closure moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feelings are labeled rather than enacted through specific physical or perceptual detail.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elian remains a label rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Motivation is declared ("to hush it") but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator's motivation to learn architectural language is sustained, and the interiority remains consistent through the teaching sessions. However, the protagonist's emotional arc lacks concrete contradiction or micro-choices that test commitment; the acceptance of Finch's ghostly nature arrives fully formed rather than earned through on-page friction. The final moment—receiving the seal—feels like inheritance rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Finch remains more atmospheric device than character with agency that pressures the narrator's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior life remains abstract—"ghostly resolve" and "tragically radiant" function as labels rather than embodied contradictions. The quarantined memory unfolds cleanly but the processing feels summarized: we're told she translates isolation into independence without witnessing micro-choices that dramatize the friction between wanting connection and choosing solitude. The final transformation from "charmed skeptic" to self-reliant individual happens off-stage between paragraphs twenty-three and twenty-four, announced rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is present but abstract, relying on therapy-speak like "burden that had weighed upon her soul" and "chains of that treachery." The motivation to forgive is declared repeatedly rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The blood-and-thorn gesture at the end substitutes for earned character change; we see ritual action but no internal struggle that makes renunciation costly. Embodied emotion is thin—trembling hands appear once, then vanish into summary reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen remains a voice delivering narrated states rather than a person making choices under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract labels ("richly perceptive," "reed-blown melancholy") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation into "an echo himself" is asserted rather than earned through prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Motivation is told repeatedly but never tested by a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's interiority is largely absent; we see only his movements and backstory summary. His motivation "to salvage something pure" is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or genuine doubt. The visit to Anya proceeds without friction—no micro-choice reveals what he risks or sacrifices, no embodied emotion beyond "tears welled." Internal conflict is missing; decisions feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen remains a static contemplator throughout; no contradictory impulses or difficult choices emerge on the page. His "demure audacity" is asserted in narration but never tested by pressure that would force a trade-off. The tea ceremony and net-mending are pure exhibition without internal friction or visible cost. Reflection dominates nearly every paragraph, yet no micro-choice alters his stance—he begins appreciating hidden effort and ends appreciating hidden effort, unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—excavating truth from comfortable lies—but his interiority remains largely abstract and label-driven. The piece tells us he's "sharply observant" and "skeptical" without embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (whether to share the truth or bear it alone) arrives suddenly without the internal friction or embodied cost that would make it feel earned; the winds "creep back" as a mechanical pressure rather than one arising from his own contradictory desires.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is almost entirely summarized through elevated abstract labels ("tuning fork for truths," "gritty whimsy") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her descent and speech ignite change, but we never see her wrestle with a concrete dilemma on the page—she observes, interprets, and acts without visible cost or foreclosed options. The prophet and factions remain offstage voices; no secondary character applies immediate pressure in scene. Motivation is declared poetic but never tested by a choice that reveals competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The vagrant poet's motivation (translator between generations, seeking redemption) is coherent and his method (jarring sounds) is specific. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("weight of his quest," "gleaned redemption") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The backstory of former renown is told rather than dramatized through present action, and the final "contentment" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path—he simply walks on with his jars. No on-page choice alters his stance or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen is introduced with label-only traits ("logically emotional mind") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to protect the artifact is declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost that would force a genuine dilemma. The climax relies on vibrational matching without showing what he risks or sacrifices; he simply "poured his will" and succeeds. Interiority consists of abstract statements ("analyzing pitches while feeling the urgency") instead of embodied, character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The collective at the end ("they began to unyoke themselves") diffuses agency into a faceless group without individual struggle. Interior life consists of label-only declarations ("her impatience was a old, sharp thing") rather than embodied tension. The piece describes her shaping patience but never shows her failing, hesitating, or paying a visible cost for this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to expose the cover-up is clear and drives her forward, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories") rather than embodied contradiction. The confrontation with Thorn reads as outline—she refuses, he lunges, she sidesteps—without visible internal cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously in the moment. Emotional progression from discovery to defiance is linear and tidy; no messy self-deception or irrational loyalty complicates her stance. The final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle between wants and fears.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chaplain's motivation is clear and his quest concrete, but interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("a guilt he had carried for years," "his own heart thudding a slow, penitent rhythm"). The shift from passive observer to active learner ("I want to learn") is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Elias remains a ghost—his presence shapes the chaplain's guilt but never complicates the present action with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared but never tested by pressure; the yearning algorithm's "desire for connection" and her goal to "ring a bell no one hears yet" remain abstract metaphors without forcing a choice that forecloses options. Interiority stays generic ("steadily curious," "irreverent awe") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The arrow-tip insertion and kaleidoscope work proceed without resistance or cost, leaving the protagonist's "success" unearned by struggle. The ending laugh and departure read as triumphant summary rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find deleted files is stated early but never contradicted or deepened by on-page choices under pressure. The "brightly attentive" trait appears as label-only descriptor without dramatized cost. Her lie to the supervisor is functional but not freighted with internal conflict or visible consequence that alters her stance. The ending declares a sensed absence "permanent" without showing what path she has foreclosed or what competing desire she has sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's "shadow-laced" trait and "calmly intuitive" stance appear as label-only descriptors through most of the narrative. His motivation ("map empathy onto action") is told repeatedly but never tested by a genuine internal conflict or competing impulse. The orb-reconstitution sequence unfolds without friction; he knows what to do, does it, and succeeds—no embodied struggle, no visible cost that forecloses another path. The climactic soothing of the leviathan is asserted rather than dramatized, robbing the ending of earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's transformation is asserted in the opening but her on-page choices feel contemplative rather than pressured by contradictory impulses. The parasol tip functions more as talisman than active constraint on her behavior. The shift from euthanasia tourist to disaster volunteer is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices that reveal competing motives under stress. Interiority leans toward lyric reflection without the embodied friction that would ground her internal conflict in the trawling action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The sentinel's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical reflection ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation from grief-holder to wisdom-curator unfolds through summary statements ("he realized," "he saw how") without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final vow to "listen more deeply" reads as a therapeutic epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost. Motivation remains declarative rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation to preserve wisdom is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost. His "strangely honest" trait appears as a label repeated six times without constraining a single choice or creating friction.

No contradiction between impulse and action; he simply executes his stated goal without obstacle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains fundamentally flat—a vehicle for thematic delivery rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "perceptively calm" trait is stated repeatedly but never tested or complicated; no micro-choice reveals competing desires. Mr. Hemlock's moment ("That's my wife and me, before the accident took her") is the only beat with embodied grief, but Elara's response is passive absorption, not agency. The closure substitutes collective mood for individual cost; we never see Elara forfeit anything or wrestle with a decision that would charge her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (decode linguistic growth patterns) is clear and consistent, but she remains largely unopposed and her interiority is thin—"weathered innocence" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The final choice to testify carries stated cost ("reticence made the action daunting") but is not dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose a live path; the voice simply comes and the transition is summarized. No secondary character applies pressure, and the arc from silent scholar to confident speaker feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's "precognitively forgetful" attribute operates mostly as a label rather than generating embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract assertions ("tidal longing," "rhythmic ache") instead of concrete perception. The final renunciation—accepting echoes as transient—arrives through summary reflection rather than dramatized agency with visible cost. Agency remains passive throughout; the chalk breaks and purpose evaporates without a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's expertise is asserted but her motivation—capturing the solar flare—unfolds more as poetic backdrop than embodied struggle. Internal conflict is minimal; she moves through technical adjustments with competence but without contradictory impulses or visible cost that would reveal character under pressure. The "luminous ache" is named repeatedly rather than dramatized through specific sensory or bodily experience. Backstory is integrated without swamping the present, but micro-choices lack friction that would elevate her beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by meaningful internal conflict; she executes her method flawlessly without struggle or cost. Alistair's reconciliation with Lena feels mechanical—his dictated message and the vinyl gift resolve the estrangement without dramatized friction or trade-offs. The "decisively kind" attribute appears as a label rather than a trait that constrains choices. Elara's competence is unbroken, leaving no visible mistakes or blind spots that would compound pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her internal experience remains largely label-driven ("gnawing curiosity," "surge of triumph") without embodied contradiction under pressure. The scholar role functions as exposition delivery rather than shaping micro-choices through professional bias. Her decision to use the key and perform the ritual follows a straight line without meaningful internal conflict or cost visible in her stance. The final moment with the broken key gestures toward future struggle but doesn't alter present options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior state is present but generic and abstract—"forgiving skeptic" and "yearning" function as labels rather than embodied contradictions. The character performs a ritualistic arc (retreating, gathering herbs, performing bone-setting) but micro-choices under pressure are absent; she moves through beats without visible hesitation or cost. Emotional progression is smooth and ascending (grief → purpose → luminous clarity) without credible irrationality or setback. The final transformation ("weight of her journey lift, replaced by luminous clarity") reads as therapeutic summary rather than earned stance shift with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and interiority is present throughout, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sea-glass polishing provides meditative texture, yet the decision to share it with villagers arrives through contemplation rather than pressure-driven choice.

The final choice to leave the grotto lacks visible cost that forecloses a live alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the amber pendant gesture, showing contradiction between public exposure and private meaning-making. However, interior processing leans heavily on abstract constructions ("watchful dreamer," "protected vulnerability") that label rather than dramatize psychological states. Leo's silent acceptance and the final shared stance feel earned by the pendant exchange, but his agency remains largely reactive. The piece avoids therapy-speak at peak moments yet some phrasing ("the watchful part of her settle, the dreamer part awakening") edges toward diagnostic self-awareness during resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—collecting hopes to fuel creativity—is stated rather than earned through conflicted micro-choices under pressure. Her internal contradiction (novelist's doubt vs. purpose) appears only as tell ("her conflict… melted away") without simultaneous opposing impulses dramatized in scene. The seashell mechanic substitutes for agency; Elara performs capture gestures without visible cost or meaningful hesitation that would test commitment. Embodied emotion is absent; "tears to Elara's eyes" labels rather than enacts grief.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("profound peace," "whimsical nature") and abstract labels without embodied tension.

No meaningful internal conflict complicates her arc; she executes a plan smoothly from hum to crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is dominated by declarative statements about her craft rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The motivation to "translate heartbeats into maps" is told but never meaningfully tested—no choice forces her to weigh cost against desire.

The ritual unfolds without genuine struggle or renunciation; completion feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to collect the weights of different burdens") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or meaningful choice under pressure. The weaving process unfolds as a sequence of completed tasks without internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final image claims she is "enriched by the journey" and "no longer boundary-lessly trapped," but this transformation is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

    Elara's motivation to negotiate with her ghost is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies on abstraction ("chronologically confused mind," "eroded ambitions") rather than embodied sensation or contradictory wants acting simultaneously. The final gesture—leaving the camera wheel—reads as symbolic closure without visible cost that forecloses a live option. Agency is present but the inner life remains labeled rather than enacted in scene.

His "bedraggled appearance" and "trembling resolve" are asserted labels without embodied hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final moment—watching the ghostly bird emerge—reads as passive witnessing rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists largely of abstract hypothesizing ("flawed genesis," "pure organic beauty") rather than character-particular perception or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is label-driven rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" traits are declared but never constrain a choice with visible cost—she moves smoothly from fountain to fountain without genuine internal conflict or credible mistakes. The final moment ("her skepticism washed away by the flood of truth") reads as summary rather than earned transformation through prior causality. Diagnostic label-speak ("luminous doubt now a beacon of hope") replaces embodied emotion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is signaled early and remains consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("profound unease," "troubling serenity") rather than embodied contradiction.

Emotions are declared more than inhabited: "profound peace mixed with sorrow" tells rather than enacts the cost of letting the garden fade.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)

Her interiority relies on stock phrases ("felt a pull," "profound bond") and label-only emotions without embodied contradiction. The climactic "realization" that she must continue the work is delivered as summary rather than earned through a visible choice with cost. Mr. Hemlock exists only as a framing device; his death mid-game never complicates Elara's actions or forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen remains a concept-vehicle rather than a person making contradictory choices under pressure. His motivation is declared ("to seed innovation within a constraint") but never tested by an on-page dilemma that would force him to choose between competing goods or pay a visible cost.

The grandfather exists only in backstory and objects; no on-page relationship pressure tests her choices.

    Elara's interiority is well-developed and her journey across unlearning hatred is clear, but her agency in the present scene remains passive—she searches, finds, and demonstrates, without meaningful contradiction or internal struggle in the library-to-rehearsal sequence. The transition to the choir's transformation happens too smoothly; their shift from "hesitant voices" to "braided into a chord" occurs in one paragraph without dramatized resistance or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotional progression reads earnest but tidy, with "expectantly resigned" stated rather than embodied in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by meaningful contradiction or internal conflict. Her "synaptic plasticity" operates as label-only exposition—she rewires memories via tell, not dramatized struggle. The widow's bitter soup memory is mentioned as needing to be "pruned from her spirit," yet no on-page choice forces her to sacrifice or endure cost tied to that lingering sadness. Actions align mechanically with stated goals; no flawed impulse complicates her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "involuntarily truthful nature" is asserted but never tested with cost—she speaks freely to empty air and willing ears, no dilemma forces her candor into conflict. Her motivation "to preserve wonder" remains a label recycled across paragraphs without embodied contradiction or a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Kael appears functional but flat, existing to receive exposition. The ending choice—spray water, recite riddle—feels mechanically solved rather than earned by prior struggle or competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to understand alive vs. inert houses is declared but not embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her interior remains abstractly poetic ("hushed blaze within her," "quest") rather than character-particular; no visceral contradiction drives the sanctification scene. The cottage awakening reads as convenient vindication rather than earned through prior struggle or foreclosed paths. Backstory reflection exceeds 30% without anchoring to present micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    The statue's transformation from "certain of its isolation" to "welcoming the nuance of community" is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority remains abstract ("incisively kind mind," "pierced the solitude") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance of community lacks visible cost; no path is foreclosed, only expanded through convenient essence-application. Motivations are declared but never tested by competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (capturing texture of missed opportunity) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout; her "balancedly daring" trait is asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The final shift from "chasing a ghost" to acceptance lacks causal grounding—no on-page choice forces the renunciation, only declaration. Interiority relies heavily on conceptual abstractions ("texture," "resonance in chaos") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The dice become symbolic markers without constraining tactical choices that would reveal character hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's insomniac restlessness is established but functions primarily as context rather than complicating choice. Her motivation to "prove" kindness is declared repeatedly yet never faces on-page friction or cost—she collects visions without struggle, error, or trade-off. The "methodically hopeful" tag appears three times but constrains no decision; the final descent carries assurance without forfeiture. Interiority remains abstract ("surge of emotion," "calm certainty") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to rescue dying arts is consistent and her agency drives the climax through problem-solving (lens inscription discovery, succulent honey harvest). Internal experience shows embodied frustration ("cold of the grotto seep into her bones") and the bread-baking success earns the thaw moment. However, the elders' interviews feel perfunctory—no genuine friction or mis-aim complicates her search—and the breakthrough via lens inscription arrives conveniently rather than through cost-bearing choice. The final act demonstrates competence but lacks contradictory impulses or a visible sacrifice that would elevate the change.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "step beyond fate's design" is stated but never meaningfully tested or contradicted on the page. Her interior is more concept than embodied struggle—"bleak exhilaration" and "terrifying joy devoid of hope" read as label-speak without the grounding of contradictory impulses in action. The final moment offers no visible cost or renunciation; she stands "at peace" after shattering destiny, which undercuts the stakes and feels like abstract triumph rather than earned transformation. No micro-choices under pressure force her to trade competing goods or face a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is told rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The core fear—being "just an echo of a person"—arrives abruptly at the climax without prior dramatization of that internal split. Interiority leans on abstract labels ("foreign rhythm," "hollow space") and diagnostic language ("paradoxical," "embodiment") instead of character-specific perception. The final peace feels unearned; no visible cost forecloses a prior path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prophet remains a conceptual vessel rather than a contradictory human under pressure. His motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is stated and demonstrated but never tested by failure or internal friction—he succeeds smoothly at every turn. Embodied emotion is absent; we see technical actions (striking, drawing, naming) without visceral cost or genuine struggle. The wave encounter offers no felt stakes because we never doubt his mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is rooted in Aris's absence and his training, creating a coherent through-line. His micro-choices—correlating patterns, playing the whistle sequence—show agency under pressure. The final shift from cartographer to translator feels earned, though the "quietly driven" trait is more asserted than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Internal conflict remains somewhat muted; we see determination but not the friction of doubt or cost during the peak act.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "emotionally rational" trait is mentioned repeatedly, but it reads as a label rather than embodied contradiction—she channels anger into "focused determination" without genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The parallel-drawing to her own past sacrifice is brief and functional but doesn't deepen her present choice. The final "profound peace" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options; she completes her mission cleanly, which undercuts earned transformation. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("cold and sharp," "thrill coursing through her") and diagnostic framing ("emotional rationality at work") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is stated but never faces meaningful internal contradiction or on-page trade-off. His "stoically sensitive" nature functions as label rather than forcing competing impulses in scene—he wades, writes, and reflects without genuine struggle between granite exterior and silt core. The final confession of "abandoned dream of a quiet life" arrives as told backstory rather than dramatized cost that forecloses a live option. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the prose prefers abstract terms ("rising sorrow," "flood of futility") over physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her perceptive trait is consistently shown through tactile navigation and pattern recognition. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The final discovery feels more like intellectual satisfaction than a choice with visible emotional cost—she smiles in triumph rather than grappling with what honest complexity demands of her. Micro-choices exist (probing seams, stamping pages) but they advance method more than they reveal internal conflict or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation (fold grief into cranes) is declared but never tested by competing impulses or meaningful sacrifice. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through prescribed actions (polish, fold, reunite) without genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The shadow reunion at the end feels unmotivated by prior escalation; no on-page tension forces her toward or away from reattachment. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("hollow ache," "luminous torment") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is concrete and drives action throughout—his hunt for "unused potential" is rooted in the wedding strike trauma and embodied through his interaction with the geode. The final shift from searching for pooled potential to recognizing it as "woven into the very quantum foam of reality" feels epiphanic rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior voice remains consistent, but the awakening moment relies on assertion ("he simply *knew*") rather than dramatized contradiction. The renunciation is present but the cost could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's "perpetually surprised" expression is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice or reveals internal contradiction under pressure. His motivation to "decode the frequency of belonging" remains abstract—told rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The pilgrim appears as a convenient oracle who validates his success without applying pressure or creating relational friction. Interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("profound sense of belonging," "inner truth") that replaces embodied emotion at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's guilt is clearly established and her profession as a genealogist shapes the backstory, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract recounting ("gnawed at her," "twisted her insides") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shore sequence shows her kneeling and tracing carvings, yet the decisive moment—accepting the brother's death—arrives through narrated memory rather than a present micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final walk away reads as summary resolution ("a little lighter in spirit though heavier in heart") rather than earned transformation through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated but her internal conflict remains largely abstract. Her "uncommonly thoughtful" trait is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to exchange prisoners feels foregone rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. Kael's admission about his brother provides a moment of embodied emotion, but Elara's interiority relies heavily on therapeutic phrasing ("untether," "recycle mistakes into wisdom") without the messy irrationality that high-pressure negotiation would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his internal contradiction (broken yet determined) operates throughout. However, the interiority often slides into abstract label-speak: "merrily melancholic," "align heart and action," "backlash of regrets" are repeated as phrases rather than embodied in distinct, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of the compass is earned, but the emotion is performed through laughter and declarations rather than shown through incompatible desires colliding on the page. Cost is legible but the path feels more summarized than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo's motivation to "kindle empathy" is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice under pressure. Interiority relies on abstraction ("jaded wonder," "fragile empathy growing") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation is told—"memories flooded in…as lessons"—not earned through on-page struggle. The procedure setup creates a clean-slate premise, but Leo never wrestles with a live decision that costs him something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated (reforge bond with Kael), but her internal experience during the metamorphosis relies heavily on abstract labels ("terrifying unraveling," "paradoxically steady") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation forecloses her human form with visible cost, but the choice itself feels pre-determined rather than dramatized through competing impulses in the moment. Kael's presence in the afterlife scene is passive; he offers one line of concern but applies no opposing pressure that would test Elara's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her quest is sustained, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract longing ("sharp ache," "unshed tears") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment—reaching into the crack and weaving the thread—reads as a decision, but the cost feels asserted ("release and reclamation") rather than embodied through a visible foreclosure of options. Her character-specific perceptual signature is weak; the narration could describe almost any questing figure. The phrase "willingly perplexed" appears but never constrains an on-page choice with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's pacifism is declared but never tested on-page; no choice forces her to enact or compromise it. Her "gravitationally lighter when happy" attribute appears twice but only as exposition and a brief physical sensation, never constraining a choice. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("profound sadness," "immense effort of will") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The closure step feels unmotivated—nothing on the page dramatizes why *now* is the moment the dimension opens beyond her wishing it so.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior life consists almost entirely of abstract meditation ("texture of transformation," "seamless shift") without embodied contradiction or concrete micro-choices under pressure. The pivot from destitution to renewal is asserted through summary epiphany ("she understood," "she realized") rather than earned through dramatized action that forecloses a path. The reflective mode dominates ~60% of the text but remains unanchored to present stimuli that alter tactics; releasing the jars is framed as mystical fulfillment rather than a choice with visible cost. Therapy-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("metamorphosis into a new form of richness") in peak beats further flatten interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early but never shown in conflict; she moves through the plot without internal friction, contradiction, or visible cost to her choices. The "calmly inventive" trait remains a label rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her competence is unbroken—no mistakes, no degradation under stress—and the ending simply confirms her plan without foreclosing a live option or revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of generic assertions ("felt a thrill, not of fear, but of purpose") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation (to understand sacred patterns) is clear and his precognitive curse provides internal contradiction, but the interiority relies heavily on vision-flash mechanics rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The key choice—adjusting the rock—feels mechanically necessary rather than emerging from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "smile" and emotional resolution arrive without sufficient dramatized cost; the curse lifts conveniently once its purpose is served, reading as a neat payoff rather than earned endurance or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "understand the cartography of scars" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her "furiously tranquil" state is told as a label without embodied contradiction—no actions show rage and peace acting simultaneously. The stranger's redemption arc arrives unearned, with no prior characterization to make his turn credible. Internal states are summarized ("she felt a surge of storm-kissed wonder") rather than shown through perception and bodily response.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical claims ("to transform the enigma of existence into a tangible path") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mechanical arm is gestural furniture—described via scorpion simile and gear-twitching—but never constrains a choice or reveals character through micro-decisions. The opponent arrives as pure shadow, speaks one line, and the "duel" dissolves into metaphor ("each strike a syllogism") without dramatized stakes or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "disarmament" via scroll revelation reads as convenient plot resolution rather than earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" is declared but not tested against meaningful opposition that would reveal contradictory impulses. The monthly personality molts are told rather than dramatized—we're informed they happen and that tonight one occurs, but no micro-choice on the page shows the cost or friction of shedding the "cynical wanderer." Leo functions as stable anchor but remains a sketch; the friendship is summarized in backstory rather than pressured in the present scene. The final choice to continue rebuilding lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clearly established (rewrite the past, surprise fate), but his agency in key moments is undermined by passive construction—he "found" the anomaly rather than hunting for it through strategic analysis. The "strategically creative" attribute is labeled repeatedly but never shown constraining a choice with visible cost; we're told his mind works "several steps ahead" without seeing those steps dramatized. Interiority relies on abstract phrases like "steely longing" and "cold fire that refused to be extinguished" rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (stepping through the film) feels more like following a pre-set procedure than a wrenching decision that forecloses other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated repeatedly but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "luminous doubt" is mentioned as a constant companion yet never shapes a concrete decision or creates visible hesitation that costs her time or tactical advantage. Interior life consists of generic labels ("deep need," "profound connection") rather than character-particular perception. The final contentment arrives without any renunciation or visible trade-off that would prove growth or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is stated but never tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his journey reads as a guided meditation rather than internal struggle. The final "realization" about cerulean regret arrives through summary rather than embodied choice with visible cost. Elian functions as a wisdom-dispenser without applying pressure or forcing Kaelen into a difficult trade-off. The locket discovery feels coincidental rather than earned through prior agency.

Her gravitational lightness when happy is an embodied trait that creates internal conflict, such as when she must anchor herself to maintain focus. The final choice to cross over feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving the ship behind. However, her emotional range is somewhat narrow, with joy and sadness being the primary states, limiting deeper contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to understand transformation is clear and rooted in her past, compelling her choice to release the lightning bugs. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the "smooth, granular sand" during her epiphany. The final renunciation of her past is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving the jars behind. However, some emotional beats rely on summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions under pressure. Her calmly inventive nature is demonstrated through micro-choices like decoding the sundial and distributing pamphlets. However, the lack of internal conflict or flaws slightly limits depth, though it doesn't undermine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown through his cursed visions. His final understanding is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the curse lifting. Micro-choices, like adjusting the rock, reveal his values and struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and internal conflict; her final choice to write is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the sundial) revealing his hierarchy of values. The final collaboration is earned by prior causality, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, slightly reducing embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The monthly molting adds depth, though it leans slightly abstract in execution. The relationship with Leo serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter her state, and the final hopeful self feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in steely longing, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and strategic creativity. His final choice to play a new composition is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost as the clock shows a new time. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his wistful playing shifting to defiant action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and drives her actions, with micro-choices under pressure like planting the seed based on interpreted dreams. However, interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels like "luminous doubt" rather than fully embodied contradiction, limiting depth in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in emotional weight; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "regrets pooling like cerulean waters." His change is earned through on-page actions (studying lace, using compass), and Elian provides secondary pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; final renunciation has visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s profession, worldview, and motivation are clearly delineated and consistently drive her attention and responses. Her choice to treat the wreckage as “new initial conditions” rather than loss feels specific and character-driven. However, the emotional life is more stated than bodily embodied, and we rarely see active, in-scene contradictory impulses; the inner conflict resolves a bit too smoothly into serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation and core trait (“steadily adaptive; she had already begun to mold her fear into focus”) are clear and consistent, and her decision to create art instead of seeking revenge is thematically coherent. However, her interiority leans abstract and idealized, with little embodied contradiction or messy emotional conflict under trauma. We rarely see specific, character-particular flaws or blind spots distorting her choices. The closing resolve lands but feels relatively low-cost and emotionally smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate silence into music as a response to surviving the capsizing—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her actions, especially in the heat-mapping and repeated use of the tuning forks. Interiority is reasonably embodied (cool metal on her forehead, moving among ice-blooms), though the emotional palette leans heavily on a few abstractions (grief, resolve, purification) rather than more contradictory, moment-to-moment impulses. The arc from trauma to a kind of earned stasis/acceptance by the final tapestry of colors feels motivated and credible at this length. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper internal conflict (e.g., self-blame versus desire for beauty) dramatized in-scene rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elijah’s core traits—weariness, long-term devotion to the dead, inadvertent stubbornness—are clear and consistently motivate his choices, especially his refusal to leave before fixing the lens. However, his interior life is more summarized than dramatized, with limited on-page contradiction or genuine internal struggle. The decision to risk himself in the underwater library feels plausible but emotionally underdeveloped. The final lift in his weariness is earned in concept, but not pushed into truly complex ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear and consistent, and her calm, steady leadership is well embodied in her actions (organizing the runs, ringing the bell, making the declaration). However, she reads as almost entirely virtuous and composed, with little in the way of contradictory impulses or visible flaw. Her emotional life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized under sharp pressure, so we don’t see her genuinely strained. The final stance feels earned but low-cost because no internal conflict is foregrounded or tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing and vocation are clearly motivated and consistent, and her emotional responses to the tear and the strands of unused love feel embodied and specific. However, internal contradiction is limited—once the artifact appears, her path is largely smooth, with little visible ambivalence or resistance. The final wholeness lands, but it comes with minimal felt cost and no real missteps along the way. This keeps the arc persuasive but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation and professional identity are clear and specific, and her actions (redesigning the maze, using the fragment) align with that drive. However, her interior life is more conceptual than embodied; we’re told her burden and then told her peace, with limited sensory or contradictory emotional texture in between. The final shift from “prison of shadows” to serenity feels somewhat unresisted, with little on-page struggle at the decisive moment. This keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her chains-as-weapon beat against the guard gives a glimpse of ingenuity under pressure. However, her interiority stays generalized and heroic, with little contradiction or real doubt even at peak moments. The guard reads as a flat obstacle rather than a relationship-based crucible that forces morally complex choices. Her final liberation feels thematically neat but emotionally under-earned because we haven’t seen enough internal struggle or real cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent—transmuting the sound of broken trust via her hearing aids—but she rarely faces live, pressured choices on the page. Interiority is particular in places (cracked-bell memory, synesthetic colors), yet her emotional journey often arrives as summarized understanding rather than dramatized contradiction. We get little sense of simultaneous impulses (e.g., desire for revenge vs. healing) that would complicate her quest. The final reframing of absences as “potentials for healing” feels plausible but somewhat declarative rather than earned through concrete, conflicted decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to steal futures so she can “press her ear against destiny’s door”—is vivid and specific, and her competence with codes and moonbeams feels earned. Her internal tension between savvy caution and the irresistible pull of the portrait (ignoring the black-orchid warning) gives her a credible contradiction. However, the cost to her psyche or worldview is only lightly sketched; beyond the nearly empty jar, we don’t yet see a deeply personal price or flaw-driven consequence. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear, specific, and consistent, with the glassblowing process and the bookmark revealing her grief and desire for “safe zones.” The thaw from professional detachment to renewed, imperfect openness feels earned by the on-page ritual of work and her decision to leave objects behind. Contradictory impulses (control vs. messiness, safety vs. abandonment) are present but could surface more sharply in a pressured moment rather than mostly in reflection. Emotional language occasionally leans abstract (“professional detachment,” “thawing heart”) rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—his phobias, dependence on Silas, and new lineage all inform his choices, especially decoding the cast and choosing to go to the tower. His adaptive mindset under fear is well dramatized in moments like using “each panicked breath to sharpen his focus.” However, internal conflict resolves a bit too cleanly into a thesis (“vulnerability is power”), with little lingering contradiction or real moral mess in the closing confrontation. The relationship with Silas is powerful in concept but under-dramatized on the page, mostly summarized rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    The oracle’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to create a map of the endless night—and her actions align with that goal. However, her interiority is relatively flat: “mildly obsessed” is asserted but not deeply dramatized as a live contradiction or source of mistake. She endures fatigue and cold but these costs are gestured at rather than embodied. The ending choice (to leave with peace) feels believable but low-stakes in terms of visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    J-7’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and the contrast between “mindless drone” and “budding entity” gives it some dimensionality, but its interior life is told in broad strokes rather than dramatized through specific, pressured micro-choices. The final realization arrives smoothly, with little sense of struggle or contradiction in the moment, so the change feels somewhat pre-packaged. The janitor role and second-chance status hint at richer conflict (duty vs. curiosity, obedience vs. selfhood) that the scene never really forces into contact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to clear her name and restore trust) is clear and consistent, and her investigative choices track logically with that drive. However, her interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied in specific sensations or contradictory impulses under pressure. Marco’s guilt is sketched efficiently but without much nuance beyond “fear of blame.” The reconciliation lands, but it feels easy, with little on-page struggle or cost to complicate their emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and we see her making small, value-driven choices (redirecting vines, polishing marbles, inviting skeptics). However, she experiences almost no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her worldview is affirmed rather than tested. Emotion is mostly summarized rather than embodied, so we don’t feel much lived struggle behind each “mended deception.” The final state is an endurance of her starting stance with little sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his “obliging” nature paired with a secret, ambitious theory gives him some dimension. However, he faces little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; there’s no real moment where kindness, duty to the station, and obsession with his theory truly strain against one another. Dr. Aris’s arc from skepticism to warmth is legible but straightforward and not deeply pressured. The final emotional shift feels earned but low-stakes and a bit tidy for elite-lit standards.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation—to unravel the ghost’s code and provoke a response—is clear and consistent, and her choices (testing the program with water, following the map, slapping the water) all align with that drive. Interiority is serviceable but not especially deep; we get sensory impressions and a sense of awe more than textured, contradictory emotional life. Her arc from obsession to quiet acceptance/inspiration is legible but largely conceptual, with little felt cost or moral tension. The ghost, as the only other character, remains a pure function of the plot with no complex relational dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal conflict between needing certainty and learning to accept error is clear and tracked from fever-break to recalibration, with specific choices around the illustration and data console. Her “fault-tolerant oracle” identity and fear of futility give her a distinct psychology. The main limitation is that some emotional beats are summarized in abstract terms (“her certainties had been swaying,” “the weight of the swallowed truth”) instead of more embodied, character-particular reactions. The change at the end—acceptance of smudges and ambiguity—feels earned, though the cost remains relatively quiet and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—“to find the weight of a swallowed truth”—is clear and consistently drives his decisions, and his skepticism vs. attraction to ruins gives him some texture. His behavior (pressing deeper despite danger, using an odd research method) feels rooted in that character. However, interior conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized; we don’t see his impulses genuinely pull against each other in-scene. The ending shift to “reverence” reads plausible but slightly summarized rather than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.6)
    The keeper’s purpose and temperament are clear and consistent, and the restlessness that sends them to the refuge gives a modest internal nudge. However, their inner life remains largely abstract—more role than person—and contradictory impulses (duty vs. withdrawal, judgment vs. non-judgment) are stated rather than dramatized under pressure. The final “change” feels more like a restated thesis than a fully earned, costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and Leo’s shift from withdrawn to awed is legible, but both remain idealized figures rather than fully individuated people. Interiority is mostly summarized (“Her motivation was steadfast”) rather than dramatized through moment-to-moment thought and embodied reaction. The relationship is warm but never under real strain, so we don’t see values tested or contradictory impulses in action. The generational coda extends the arc but reiterates the same uncomplicated virtue rather than adding complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and his sensitivity to the walls gives him a distinct slant, but he lacks real internal contradiction or difficult choice. He moves from curiosity/duty to fulfillment without on-page hesitation or morally costly trade-off. Emotional states are mostly summarized (“he felt a profound connection”) rather than embodied in specific, pressured reactions. The final “change” is more world-conceptual than character-earned, which limits the depth of his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivations are clearly stated (Elara’s desire to escape isolation; Leo’s need for redemption), but they’re told rather than dramatized and rarely come under pressure. Interiority is generic, with little embodied emotion or contradiction—Elara never seems genuinely torn between safety and risk. The relationship between Elara and Leo snaps into trust almost instantly, without friction or cost. The final “change” into purposeful partnership feels unearned because we’ve not seen them struggle or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Father Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—he must protect the anchor by exposing the entity’s flawed assumptions—but his inner life is mostly stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. We rarely feel his fear, doubt, or temptation; his composure and competence are nearly uniform, which flattens emotional stakes. Micro-choices around how far he will push, what he risks, or what it costs him internally are implied but not textured on the page. The dimming palette as a cost is strong, but it isn’t clearly tied to a personal compromise or change in him.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to conduct unheard symphonies and soothe her chronological homesickness) is specific and consistent, and her actions—mapping memories, pushing through exhaustion—align cleanly with it. Interiority is largely filtered through sensory recall rather than complex contradictory impulses, so internal conflict feels fairly simple (finish before fatigue vs. give in). Embodied emotion is present but often stylized, more in images than messy ambivalence. The final shift to “chronologically homesick no more” is emotionally credible but arrives a bit neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen’s goal and general psychology are clear, but his interiority leans abstract (“to conquer the labyrinth of self”) with limited, concrete, character-specific emotional texture. His periodically eternal nature is intriguing yet mostly summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses on the page. The final renunciation of being a “gravity defier” is conceptually earned but arrives as a stated realization more than a felt, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s numbness, history as a music teacher, and deafness create a coherent motivational spine, and her choices (seeking Kael, agreeing to the backward playback, later teaching differently) all emerge plausibly from that. Interiority is grounded in tactile perception and specific images (“a sharp sliver of silence in her palm”), not abstract labels. Internal contradiction is present but soft—she’s blocked yet fairly willing to try Kael’s idea, so we don’t see a sharp in-scene clash of impulses. The emotional shift at the end is earned, though it resolves with relative smoothness for such deep trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core traits (meticulous, solitary, principled, curious) are clearly established and her decision to risk involvement is motivated by her values and her data. The internal shift from “integrity in solitude” to accepting partnership is legible but comes with minimal felt cost or ambivalence on the page. Emotions skew a bit labeled and tidy (“layered tranquility,” “calm resolve”) rather than messily embodied under threat. The zone-woman reads more as a function than a fully pressured character, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand her scent-triggered tears) is clear and threads cleanly through the scene, and her choice to open the vial despite her “aromatic caution” is a credible, revealing action. Her grief is embodied enough to feel particular (the mother, the jasmine) rather than generic. The main weakness is how swiftly her emotional conflict resolves into tidy understanding, with little on-page resistance or contradiction at the peak. A touch more friction or self-doubt under pressure would make the final shift feel even more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation (to grasp the “texture of time”) and his history with the Wardens and the rope create a coherent, particular inner life, and his final sacrifice is clearly motivated by his moral temperament and past guilt. The ethically playful trait is hinted at in his appreciation of the “cruel poetry” of his dilemma, but it could drive more moment-to-moment contradiction on the page instead of staying mostly conceptual. His internal conflict between preserving his past and freeing the beings is legible, though the decision comes fairly swiftly once the beings’ pain is revealed and might benefit from one more beat of struggle. The cost—loss of memories and proof of his escape—is clear and felt, earning the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and habits are clear and consistent, and her choice to restart the bonfire tradition credibly culminates the piece, but her inner life is largely summarized rather than embodied in concrete, pressured moments. The text tells us she feels the weight of absences “like stones” yet rarely shows this through behavior that reveals contradiction or real struggle. Her shift at the end—from seeing silence as oppressive to companionable—is thematically neat but emotionally under-contested on the page. The result is a coherent but relatively low-friction arc.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s profession, method, and buried motivation are clearly established, and her interior shift from manipulative dealer to aspiring empath feels motivated by the contrast between counterfeit joy and sensed sorrow. However, much of her conflict is explained in abstract terms (“half truths had been a cage”) rather than dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses in the moment. The decision to abandon her personas is credible but emotionally smoothed over, with little sense of fear, loss, or self-protective resistance. The absence of any other on-page character also limits relational pressure on her change.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (to uplift silent contributors) is clear and consistent, and her discovery of the locket leads to plausible actions. However, her inner life remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized, with almost no contradictory impulses or real internal conflict under pressure. Anya is drawn with appealing humility but again in broad, idealized strokes. The final “change” in Elara feels like an extension of her already-stated values rather than a hard-won shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s longing for community is clear, consistent, and tied concretely to her reed work and daily choices, which gives her a solid core. However, her interiority is mostly summarized (“luminescent ache,” “deep desire”) rather than dramatized in specific contradictory impulses under pressure. The community remains a largely undifferentiated collective, so relationship dynamics never really become a crucible. Her change from isolation to belonging is plausible but emotionally smoothed; we don’t see a real risk of refusal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—freeing the echoes and restoring balance—so her macro-drive never feels arbitrary. However, most of her emotional life is summarized rather than embodied, and we don’t see much contradictory impulse or real doubt under pressure. The reveal that she ages slightly is a welcome cost but lands quickly and serenely, muting its potential as a character crucible. Overall she reads coherent, likable, and purposeful, but not yet psychologically rich enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s core motive—processing his sister Lyra’s ambiguous loss through a “mathematics of emotion”—is clear and his actions align with it, and the shift from desperate need for answers to acceptance reads earned enough for this length. However, his interiority leans on abstract and diagnostic language (“ambiguous loss,” “calculus of the heart”) rather than embodied contradiction in scene, giving him a slightly essay-figure feel. We don’t see a truly pressured choice; his revelation arrives without much on-page resistance or self-sabotage. The emotional cost of his shift is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the link between the tape, his grandmother, and his role as guardian is effective, but he reads as almost entirely saintly with little internal contradiction or cost. His emotions are mostly summarized rather than deeply embodied, and under real pressure his interiority does not deepen or fray. The arc from hidden dweller to “visible” guardian is thematically clean but emotionally low-friction. A touch of genuine fear, doubt, or selfishness would give his choices more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s controlling temperament, anxiety, and scientific mindset are clearly established and consistently dramatized through her attention to leaf, soil, and storm. The internal contradiction between her need for control and the dawning realization that she must release it is credible and earns the final shift. Her choices—to let the leaf go, to refrain from tying the tree, to begin rebuilding differently—track cleanly with that evolution. A slight weakness is the tendency to state traits and life patterns (“Her entire life had been a testament to control”) rather than always letting actions reveal them.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen feels specific and coherent—insomniac, haunted by lost water, driven to “thresh meaning from experience”—and his choices (following the rain, keeping the brooch, agreeing to the trade, gifting a painting) all flow convincingly from that core. Elara is sketched efficiently but with enough history and weariness to matter, and the sibling/peace-treaty detail is sharp. The main limitation is that internal contradiction is mostly gestured at (wry cynicism vs hope) rather than dramatized under pressure; his shift toward peace comes smoothly, without much on-page struggle. The final adjustment—no longer fighting wakefulness—feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivations are clear—Kaelen wants to amplify everyday magic and fears his blurred sight; Elara seeks to make the ordinary extraordinary—but both read as archetypal rather than individuated. Kaelen gets the stronger arc, moving from unease at lost foresight to acceptance of mystery, but we rarely feel his conflict in embodied, character-specific terms. Elara’s “pure heart” is mostly asserted, with little on-page contradiction or cost. The final choice (her becoming part of the cave) is told rather than dramatized as a sacrifice, which softens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and her archivist mindset is nicely embedded in how she approaches problems. However, her interiority remains relatively smooth and unconflicted; we don’t see much genuine doubt, frustration, or morally complicated choice. Her final decision to reinterpret the exile and lead a ceremony is emotionally apt but comes without much visible cost or inner resistance. This keeps the arc credible but not deeply probing.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motivation and competence are clear, and her profession and tools align with her choices, but she experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure. “Trembling certainty” is asserted rather than complicated, and her shift from driven seeker to serene knower feels granted rather than hard-won. Emotional states are often labeled in abstract terms (“her spirit renewed,” “redemption”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final change reads more like a genre-expected enlightenment than a psychologically earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—to bring reflective peace to the villagers despite her skepticism—is clear and consistent, and her profession as a historian of celestial patterns adds specificity. However, her internal conflict between skepticism and belief resolves rather smoothly, with little on-page resistance or cost once the tile activates. Her emotions are often labeled in abstract terms (“patience and empathy,” “courageously kind heart”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment. The final choice to share the experience with villagers feels earned but low-risk, more affirmation than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kaelen’s core motive—cosmic boredom and obsession with what comes after goodbye—is clear and consistent, and his final repricing of immortality into “something akin to awe” offers a credible internal turn. However, his interiority leans abstract (“dry curiosity of the eternally bored”) rather than embodied or idiosyncratic, so he never fully escapes archetype. The piece gestures at internal conflict (curiosity vs. risk, tool vs. being-used) but doesn’t dramatize simultaneous contradictory impulses in the moment of choice. His final stance is interesting but lightly earned compared to the scale of what he risks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s core motivation and contradiction—“the con artist’s honest child” seeking a fair trade—are strong and consistent, and his refusal to use his father’s methods gives his choices moral texture. However, his internal conflict is mostly stated rather than dramatized; we’re told his calculus rather than feeling him wrestle in-scene. The turn to using the ink pot on the chief happens smoothly, with little felt ambivalence or fear at the moment of action. The chief himself is more function than character, with limited depth beyond “inflexible protocols” and a quick conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s motivation and method are clear and particular, and his studious temperament is consistently embodied in his precise, ritualized actions. However, he lacks on-page internal conflict or contradiction; his choices never come under meaningful emotional strain. The result is a strong, coherent portrait but with limited dynamism or visible cost to his devotion beyond implied solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation and method (“collecting fragments,” layering stories) are distinct and consistent, and his status as a clerical ghost is compelling. However, he reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully individuated person; concrete, character-particular embodiment is sparse. Internal conflict is muted—he mainly wants one thing and moves steadily toward it, with little sense of contradictory impulses. The final realization is emotionally credible but could land harder if we’d seen more textured, moment-to-moment feeling under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (decode the universal riddle) is clear, consistent, and drives her life history and present stance, and her “gloomy cheerfulness” at the end reads as an earned endurance. However, internal conflict is relatively low-friction—she moves toward acceptance without much in-scene resistance or contradictory impulse beyond the tonal paradox. Her relationship with Alistair is emotionally anchored via the seashell and remembered lines, but it functions more as a steady guide than a crucible under pressure. The final shift to embracing the journey over the answer is credible but lands more as gentle realization than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is specific, competent, and internally conflicted; the dual pull between community loyalty and belief in corporate sustainability feels grounded and drives her choice to fight via coded graffiti instead of open confrontation. The foundation stone chip nicely externalizes her attachment to Aqualia’s past. However, the internal conflict is more stated than dramatized in micro-choices, and we don’t see her make a painful mistake or sacrifice on the page. Emotional texture could deepen under pressure, especially as the ships draw nearer.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, legacy object, and clear motivation make her feel specific and grounded, and her quiet pride at the end is earned. However, her emotional palette is fairly uniform—melancholy, duty, curiosity—without much contradictory impulse or real internal struggle on the page. Her “purposeful curiosity” informs small choices (noting shades, cataloging), but does not significantly complicate or endanger her mission. The endurance choice at the end reads credible but low-cost, which limits the depth of her arc.

    Elara is clearly drawn as a serene, devoutly attentive repairer, and her blindness-as-sensory-shift is integrated into her methods. However, she faces almost no internal conflict: no doubt, frustration, or competing impulse ever really tests her “magnetic calm.” Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The closing sense of fulfillment lands, but at low cost and without a visible inner shift.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and his dry wit (“Glaciers make poor cartographers”) gives him individuality. His motivation to find the river’s source is well-rooted in his identity as an atlas editor. However, his internal life stays relatively straightforward—there’s a hint of doubt and worry but little in-scene contradiction or real struggle in his choices. The final acceptance of the discovery as “merely a chapter” lands, but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian’s core motivation—to restore shared balance—is clear and consistent, and his competence as a ritual specialist is well-rendered. However, he reads more as an emblematic figure than a psychologically specific person, with almost no interior conflict or contradictory impulses. His “infinite patience” is stated but not meaningfully tested. The ending implies completion without any felt personal cost, which flattens his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s core motivation (capture the hush) and internal conflict (instinct to rush/flee vs need for calm precision) are clear and consistent, especially in the locking-mechanism sequence. However, his interiority is largely functional rather than particular; we learn little about him beyond this mission, so his emotions skew generic. The “he had become his own rescue” realization fits his arc but lands more as stated thesis than organically inevitable self-recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation—redeeming a legacy of lies by threading his own story into the prison—is clear and particular, and his micro-choices (what truths to offer the walls, how he moves through the labyrinth) align. His interiority is vivid but more asserted than dramatized; we’re told his hunger for redemption rather than seeing more moment-to-moment contradiction between fear and desire. The final change (freedom via acceptance of truth) feels earned by prior set-up, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied. Secondary pressures (the dead guards, the warden) remain off-stage, keeping his relational complexity limited.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivations are clear and consistent—her debt and his half-remembered bond—but both characters stay archetypal, with limited, specific interior contradiction or lived texture. Elian’s shift from baffled longing to content acceptance is emotionally legible but comes largely via information delivered by the bead, not hard choice under pressure. The “lovingly venomous” dynamic is evocative but mostly told rather than embedded in distinct behaviors. Overall, strong scaffolding for character, but not yet at the specificity or moral complexity a top-tier venue would require.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s central motivation—“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is clear and consistently aligned with her actions, and her haunting optimism gives her a distinct emotional tint. However, she faces no real internal contradiction or moral friction; there’s little sense of competing impulses under pressure. Her emotions are mostly summarized in abstract terms (“hauntingly optimistic,” “orchid solace”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular sensations or micro-choices. The final shift from ruiner to restorer feels more like fulfillment of a static role than a hard-won change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (excavating, rebuilding the sundial, reading the scrolls) track cleanly with that goal. However, she’s rendered almost entirely as an earnest, competent seeker with little contradiction or visible flaw, which flattens her under pressure. Emotional states are often summarized rather than embodied (“her hands trembling with reverence” is a rare, stronger moment). The ending shift to “a restored heart” feels earned in premise but light in on-page struggle or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motive—using pseudonyms and codes to protect resistant communication—is clear and consistent, with some concrete habits (the ebony clipboard, ritual of early arrival) grounding her. However, she faces almost no on-page opposition, so we rarely see her under genuine pressure making revealing trade-offs. Internal contradiction is minimal; her “deep-seated need” is asserted more than dramatized through conflicted choices. The silent war stakes and her fear Orion might be compromised never force a visible emotional or ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s blend of calculated foolishness and incisive perception is clear and consistent, and her methods logically flow from who she is. Her inner stakes (safety vs responsibility to truth) are present but could be more sharply dramatized in specific, embodied beats rather than mostly conceptualized. The late choice to blow out the candle feels motivated by accumulating pressure and knowledge, not arbitrary. Emotional textures skew a bit generalized—more concrete bodily or sensory reactions under stress would deepen her particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained—she enters with a defined goal (to locate the moment before Kaelen’s non-apology) and ends in a credible choice of self-directed forgiveness. Her interiority is often vivid (“her heart a knot of unsent letters”) and actions align with her aims. However, her internal conflict feels relatively smooth and idealized; we see more lyric description of pain than truly contradictory impulses under pressure. The final forgiveness lands, but with limited sense of what it costs her to relinquish resentment in that instant.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s inner life is rich, specific, and coherent, with the tension between her “shrewdly innocent” belief in peace and her embodied familiarity with trauma rendered convincingly. Her motivation—to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” through decrypting Kaito’s cast—is clear and drives the piece. The emotional progression from ache to quieter resolution feels earned rather than tidy. A minor softness is that some key traits (e.g., “lotus-hearted ache”) are named rather than fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s longing to rediscover joy is clear, consistent, and expressed through specific actions (wandering the district, choosing to activate the fragment). Her interiority is concrete and tied to sensory perception—she “saw the world not just in pigment, but in luminescence and shadow.” Internal contradiction is relatively mild: there’s some tension between resignation to the fog and her stubborn hope, but it never sharpens into a hard choice. The final warmth and acceptance feel earned, though the arc leans gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s arc from expert restorer to celebrant of uncertainty is clear and coherent, and her micro-choices with the coin and crystal track with that shift. However, the internal conflict remains relatively unpressured—she relinquishes “certainty” with little resistance or cost beyond a stated realization. Emotions are often labeled or generalized (“pure, unending curiosity”) rather than grounded in more idiosyncratic embodied reactions. The final renunciation (“her own role was not to restore, but to reawaken”) feels earned but somewhat too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear—she is a rogue scholar intent on protecting subversive thought—and her actions (signaling, seeding, confronting the enforcers) align with this. However, her interiority remains fairly generalized; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a real moment of doubt under pressure. The “candidly cryptic” trait is gestured at but not deeply dramatized in how she thinks vs. how she speaks. The final choice to stand her ground then flee feels consistent but not especially costly or revelatory of hidden facets.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and the shift from restless striving to a kind of earned rest is legible. However, his emotional life is rendered mostly in conceptual terms (“photosynthesize pain into beauty,” “shyly unstoppable”) rather than in embodied, scene-specific reactions. Internal contradiction is implied (anguish vs. peace) but rarely dramatized in the moment through concrete micro-choices. The result is evocative but somewhat abstracted characterization, strong for lyric work but not yet at elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving the sound of forgotten names—is clear, consistent, and plausibly tied to her inherited duty. We get some embodied interiority in “foxglove regret,” but her conflict remains mostly tonal rather than enacted as a true dilemma. Her competence feels slightly too smooth; she encounters no meaningful resistance while solving the central problem. The endurance of her vigil at the end reads as credible Earned Stasis, but the emotional cost could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her profession and beliefs inform her choices in a credible way. However, her interiority stays fairly noble and straightforward; we don’t see much simultaneous contradiction (resentment vs. guilt, hope vs. pride) under pressure. Kaelen, as an on-page presence, is more symbolic than textured, so the relationship dynamic at the moment of reunion feels underdeveloped. The final restoration of trust feels a bit easy because we haven’t seen Elara’s flaws or defenses truly resist her intentions.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s professional competence and desire to reconcile the council and historians are clear, and her discovery of the old keeper’s secret nicely reframes her motives. However, her internal conflict remains relatively low-grade—doubt is mentioned but not deeply dramatized as a live, contradictory impulse under pressure. The cost of her choices (e.g., potential professional risk in “subtle adjustments that would go unnoticed by inspectors”) is underdeveloped on the page. The arc from curiosity to “quiet joy” feels earned but somewhat frictionless for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motives (protecting lost songs, fear of attachment, reliance on a reinvented past) are clear and consistent, and her shift toward trust and authenticity is legible and earned by the grandfather-letter reveal. However, her emotions are mostly told in abstract terms (“learning to trust again after a betrayal that had shattered her world”) rather than embodied in specific reactions or conflicted impulses in scene. Leo functions more as an idealized facilitator than a fully pressured character with his own sharp edges. The final embrace of her “true history” carries some cost on the page, but the breakdown and repair process is compressed and slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire to understand “why some thresholds feel sacred” is clear and consistent, and her methodical engagement with the bench and logbook aligns with that drive. However, her emotional life remains mostly in the register of calm, lucid reflection; we rarely feel contradictory impulses or genuine struggle on the page. The shift from “lost child” to “keeper of sacred spaces” is thematically apt but comes a bit too smoothly, with little visible cost or resistance. Still, her worldview is distinctly hers, and the closing identity change is at least grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clearly articulated—she’s seeking “the rhythm of belonging” and that desire consistently colors her perceptions. However, her emotional life stays fairly smooth; we don’t see much genuine contradiction or cost as she moves from curiosity to epiphany. The relationship with Dr. Aris is evocative but distant, functioning more as a touchstone than an active crucible that complicates her choices. Her final realization feels earned enough but also somewhat tidy, without a real sacrifice or hard-earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his occupation meaningfully shapes his perceptions and actions. However, his interiority leans conceptual and summary-heavy (“cheerful gloom,” “pang of cheerful gloom”) rather than embodied or idiosyncratic, so he never quite escapes archetype. There’s little genuine internal contradiction or real struggle under pressure, and his final “vow” feels more like an expected stance than a costly shift. Strong framework, but not yet the deeply particular, pressure-shaped interiority top venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—an analytical performer waging a “quiet revolution” against monotony—and her methods align with that. However, she faces almost no real resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine strain; she’s competent, serene, and successful throughout. The emotional cost of her solitude and meticulousness is only lightly implied, never really dramatized. As a result, she feels textured but not quite fully tested or transformed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal and defiant temperament are clear and consistent, and the bodily experience of the ritual (pain, collapse, humming energy) grounds her. However, she moves through the piece with almost no contradictory impulses or real hesitation, so interior conflict is shallow. The “exile as protest” stance is stated rather than stress-tested, which blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, habits, and way of seeing are specific and coherent, and her reflective ritual with the pond feels grounded in who she is. Her motivation (“to illuminate value in the mundane”) is well dramatized through glass, water, and light. However, her internal change arrives with minimal resistance or contradiction—there’s little sense of struggle or cost in her acceptance of the dredging. That smoothness keeps the characterization from feeling fully lived-in at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, scars, and ritual walks create a coherent, particular interior life, and her relationship to the porcelain box effectively reveals who she is. Motivation is clear (to transform pain into shared meaning) and consistent, but it doesn’t sharpen into specific, pressured choices beyond walking, opening the box, and reflecting. Internal conflict remains muted—there’s little sense of her actively resisting or doubting her own project in the moment. The final reconfiguration (innocence as key to empathy) is emotionally plausible but comes with limited on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her actions (releasing balloons, adjusting patterns, placing the pearl) align coherently with her stated goal. However, she faces almost no resistance, doubt, or emotional contradiction; her competence goes largely untested. There is little sense of cost to her, and no real internal conflict between impulses. This keeps the characterization elegant but emotionally shallow for a piece aiming at top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation and perceptual style are clear and consistent, and her choice to take the diaries and reframe her role at the end feels causally motivated. However, she experiences little genuine ambivalence or contradictory impulse on the page – she absorbs the material almost too smoothly. Emotional states are often summarized (“felt that burden now”) instead of being more idiosyncratically embodied. The final shift from cartographer to “keeper of forgotten stories” is earned but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra’s goal and method are clear and consistent, but her interior life remains narrow: she is calm, graceful, purposeful, without much contradiction or visible flaw. The “borrowed heartbeat” is interesting but functions more as poetic concept than a pressure point that forces hard choices. Emotional states are mostly implied via atmosphere instead of embodied conflict, so we never see her genuinely strained. The ending doesn’t reveal a new facet of her character so much as confirm what we already know.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—atonement through securing peace—is clear and consistent, and her willingness to sacrifice herself is well set up. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“price of redemption weighed heavily upon her”) more than on character-specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. We rarely feel a live tension between self-preservation and duty; her choice to die reads as foregone rather than contested in scene. The clan representatives remain largely faceless, offering no relational crucible to complicate her psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: the amoral philanthropist whose sentimental streak compels this futile act is specific and convincing. His inner contradiction is dramatized in the walk, the kneeling, and the struggle between “amoral nature” and “heart” rather than simply asserted. The emotional throughline from calculated drought-maker to man seeking a small, private absolution reads earned, though occasionally told a bit baldly. The final sense of being “emptier and strangely unburdened” lands as a credible, modest shift rather than an overblown epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—defy the lullaby of conformity—and her methodical, embodied actions (kneeling in the snow, teasing out threads) align with that drive. The internal contradiction between safety in submission and the lure of liberation shows most vividly in the final thread that “promised safety in submission,” giving her final decisive pull credible cost. However, her interiority leans toward generalized lyricism rather than highly particular, character-specific thought, so she feels more like an archetypal figure than a fully individuated person. The transformation at the end is earned, but emotionally it lands more as elegant concept than as a deeply personal rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation (ethical storytelling) is clear and consistent, and her habits (calligraphy, the dome refuge) give her some specificity. However, her inner conflict is overly tidy: she moves from indignation to enlightened adjustment without much resistance or contradiction on the page. The argument with Marco, the main relational crucible, is off-stage and summarized, so we never see her serenity genuinely strained. The final choice to “reverse” her approach feels plausible but almost frictionless, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s motivation and methods are clear and consistent, and his role as “collector of vanishing things” aligns well with every choice he makes. However, his interiority leans toward serene acceptance, with little real contradiction or friction beyond generalized ache. The lack of a sharper internal conflict undercuts the sense of cost in his final renunciation (releasing the wing and leaving the grotto). He reads as distinct but somewhat idealized, with limited flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation (preserving forgotten names as a form of absolution) is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a caster gives her a specific lens. However, she encounters almost no resistance—internal or external—so we see little contradiction, doubt, or real-time struggle under pressure. Emotional states are often summarized in elevated abstractions (“snowmelt ardor,” “hard-won absolution”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final peace feels earned conceptually but not deeply dramatized as a hard-won psychological turn.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Foresight’s motivation and nature (split between past and future, bound by a decaying directive) are clear and consistent, and her final choice to step through the gateway feels earned. However, her interior conflict is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as clashing impulses in the moment; we’re told her realization more than we feel her wrestling with it. Emotion tends to be expressed via elevated abstractions (“ultimate freedom,” “precise playfulness”) rather than concrete, character-specific embodiment. The result is a strong but somewhat distanced characterization that could carry more lived tension under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    Aris’s core traits—frugal, empiricist, reverent toward the cosmos—are clear and consistent, and his goal is well-motivated. However, his internal conflict is mostly asserted (“empirically ironic faith”) rather than dramatized moment-to-moment in concrete, contradictory impulses. His emotions tend to be summarized instead of embodied, especially at the climax (“his heart full” is generic). The final “he had given everything, yet gained everything” gestures at cost without showing what he truly risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivations are clear—Elara wants to neutralize Kael’s resentment, Kael clings to grievance—but they’re largely told rather than embodied. Elara’s “scheming pacifist” nature is asserted more than dramatized, and we rarely see her inner conflict or doubt. Kael’s shift from rigid bitterness to tears and release is abrupt and unlayered, reading as an engineered epiphany rather than a struggle. Emotional texture leans on abstract phrasing (“cellular memories buried under layers of bitterness and pride”) instead of particular, character-specific reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his craft grounds him nicely, but his inner life remains relatively simple: he wants the dream and encounters little internal contradiction. His “firmly grounded” trait is mostly stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Lyra feels underdeveloped, primarily a helper with no visible pressure exerted on Elian beyond cooperation. The change at the end—greater awareness of the veil between worlds—lands, but without a strongly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motives (protect craft, reconcile with Lyra) are clear and consistently drive her choices, and the ribbon/journal/eyes all reveal aspects of her under pressure. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: her “feisty” stubbornness is asserted more than dramatized, and her shift from rigidity to openness arrives quickly once the journal appears, without much felt struggle on the page. The reconciliation with Lyra lands emotionally but at low cost, with little evidence of lingering resentment or contradiction in either character.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—and her shift toward acceptance are clearly motivated and consistent, with the “bathroom breakthroughs” as nice idiosyncratic windows into her mind. Interiority is vivid and specific (“burned like a cold star”) and her choices (demanding “show me,” then ultimately returning the cameo) track with rising pressure. However, her internal conflict skews tidy: curiosity vs. acceptance resolves smoothly, with limited simultaneous contradiction or visible irrationality at peak moments. The cost of her renunciation (what she’s genuinely giving up) remains more gestured at than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara has a clear, coherent motivation and a specific professional identity that meaningfully shapes her choices, especially her calm, methodical approach under pressure. Kael’s fear and guilt are sketched rather than deeply inhabited, and their dynamic, while functional, doesn’t fully exploit the potential for relational friction or status shifts. Internal conflict is relatively light—Elara rarely feels torn between impulses—which keeps her admirable but somewhat emotionally distant. The closing change (her reframed relationship to the Library) is earned but not sharply costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to find the garden and reconcile her fractured identity—is clear and coherently sustained, and the sanctuary/prison dynamic on the ship gives her an effective internal crucible. The chimera-twin backstory aligns with her goal and the final acceptance of being “whole and aberrant, yet at peace.” However, much of her interiority is rendered in abstract labels (“blissfully aberrant,” “unkindled solace”) rather than concrete, conflicted impulses in scene. The final peace arrives a bit too smoothly, with limited sense of real internal resistance in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation—turning confusion into clarity—is clear and consistent, and her professional competence as an archivist is well embedded in her actions. However, she faces little real resistance or doubt, so internal conflict and contradictory impulses never really surface under pressure. Emotional texture stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied (few physical sensations, almost no visceral responses). The final satisfaction feels earned but low-cost, more a smooth execution of a known skill than a pressured transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation—finding quiet and restoring harmonic balance—is clear and consistent, and her ritual choices (reading ice, wielding the stone, choosing integration over suppression) track well with that. However, she remains more emblematic than deeply individuated: we see little in the way of contradictory impulses, irrational fear, or specific personal history that would sharpen her under pressure. The emotional cost lands primarily as exhaustion rather than a value-laden trade-off that forecloses a path. Strongly functional, but not yet at the level of psychologically distinctive or necessary character.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and temperament are clear and particular—“thistle-blown hope” and her need to prove coincidence meaningful feel specific rather than generic. Her retrocognitive gift interacts with personality, not just plot, and her small micro-choices (staying at the work despite the “shard of hush”) read as grounded. However, internal conflict is relatively mild: doubt flickers but never forces a really costly or compromising choice, and her success comes without a visible sacrifice beyond persistence. The ending stance is earned but a bit too tidy emotionally for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s core motive (to “sculpt identity from experience”) and trait (preemptive nostalgia) are clear and consistently dramatized through his choices to measure shadows and listen to whispers. However, his emotional life stays largely at the conceptual level; we get very little concrete bodily or situational stress, so the internal shift feels reflective rather than hard-won. The final realization reads as somewhat neat and unresisted, with little visible cost to his prior stance. Still, as a single-POV, meditative piece, his interiority is coherent and specific enough to carry the story.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and the piece gives him a coherent inner world as a wandering, ritualistic artist. However, he’s more an archetypal figure than a fully individuated person; we learn little about his specific history, blind spots, or contradictory impulses. The lack of genuine internal conflict or visible cost means his change at the end feels more like confirmation of an existing role than a pressured evolution. His emotions are mostly inferred from the lyrical narration rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly drawn—patient, observant, and oriented toward pattern rather than confrontation—and her habitual way of reading the world credibly guides the indirect resolution. Kael, by contrast, is mostly a foil with minimal interiority, so the relationship dynamic feels one-sided and somewhat schematic. The core want (to understand time/transition) and the situational stake (whether to leave) are both present but never quite force Elara into visible contradiction or real risk. The final softening of tension reads earned but comparatively low-cost and emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vivid and particular—her obsession with “flavors of different silences” and her twin phobias feel specific rather than generic, and her decision to risk the inversion is clearly rooted in these traits. The internal conflict between terror and longing is present, especially as claustrophobia gives way to agoraphobia, though it could sharpen further in the moment of choice (she never wavers once she commits). Her change at the end—reframing the bunker via the gilded hush—is earned by the journey and reads as an endurance/renunciation with cost. Secondary characters are essentially offstage, so relationship pressure is muted, but that doesn’t damage the core arc.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, but she remains almost entirely without internal contradiction or emotional texture beyond serene purpose. We seldom see embodied emotion or concrete doubts; her “fluidly logical” mind is stated rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. The final satisfaction (“Elara smiled, knowing she had taken a step toward her goal”) lands, but the cost of that stance is never felt. This keeps her from reading as fully human or pressurized despite the interesting vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent, but her interiority stays generic and largely summarized (“her heart heavy with futuristic nostalgia,” “motivation burned brighter”) rather than embodied or particular. She is almost entirely competent and unconflicted, with no real contradictory impulses as the pressure nominally rises. The final acceptance of responsibility on the throne comes without any visible inner struggle or cost. Overall she feels more like a role in a myth than a psychologically specific person.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    The keeper’s motivation and history of severance are clear and consistent, and his choice to permit the encroachment tracks with the stated aim “to teach suffocating to breathe.” However, he remains more emblematic than fully individuated, with little contradiction or messiness beyond solitude vs. mission. The second character is a vague “familiar soul” whose interiority and agency barely register. The final shift toward shared breathing feels emotionally plausible but not deeply earned through layered, embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s motivation and history (pyramid scheme survivor, pressure into diamonds) are clear and well-rooted in the imagery of the bolt and the experiment, and his final transformation feels earned. However, his “virtuously mischievous” nature is more told than dramatized, and we see little genuine internal contradiction under peak pressure. Emotional beats are evocative but somewhat smoothed—he adapts quickly to an extreme, surreal experiment without much irrationality or fear. The arc from survivor to creator lands, but with less visible cost or messiness than the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist’s guilt and desire for truth are clear but rendered in abstract, generic terms (“deep need,” “haunted him for years”) without much concrete, character-specific interiority. His transformation from “dynasty ender” to “seeker of justice” happens very smoothly, with little on-page struggle or contradiction. We rarely see embodied emotion or idiosyncratic perception; he functions more as an archetype than a fully realized person. The arc is legible but feels schematic rather than earned through textured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Alaric’s core motivation—to capture possibility and shed regret—is clear and consistent, and his choice to commit to the ritual reads as character-driven. However, his internal conflict is thin: once he decides to proceed, nothing seriously challenges or complicates that drive, and his “no longer felt withdrawn” shift feels more declared than earned. Embodied emotion is present (the cold, ecstatic sensations), but he rarely thinks or reacts in ways that feel idiosyncratic rather than archetypal. The cost of his transformation—being bound to the orchard and losing his old life—remains more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s core traits—heartbroken, meticulous, gently hopeful—are clear and consistent, and her choice to pursue Jonah and Miller’s story feels motivated by that mix of pain and principle. However, her interiority leans on summary (“a fresh, aching wound”) rather than embodied, scene-specific contradiction, so we rarely feel competing impulses active at once. Jonah and Miller remain mostly schematic, conveyed via summarized letters and research with little individuating texture. The final “mending” of her heart is credible but tidy, without a sharply felt cost to her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s core motive (preserving truth against the Council) is clear and consistent, and his “carefully resourceful” trait aligns with actions like recording accounts and using coded messages. However, his interiority stays abstract—feelings like desperation or hope are told rather than embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. The lack of on-page interaction with other characters flattens his humanity and removes relational crucibles. As a result, the final vow to persist feels ideologically motivated more than psychologically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s duty and motivation are clear and consistent, and his choice to persist, adjust his playing, and accept the ongoing burden gives a credible earned stasis at the end. However, interiority is thin and generalized—“relief and sorrow,” “eerie nostalgia”—without much character-particular texture or contradictory impulses on the page. His emotional state doesn’t significantly evolve during the scene; he begins weighted by ritual and ends in essentially the same mode, just slightly relieved. This limits the felt cost and depth of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament (orderly, reverent, curious) are clear and consistent, and her arc from solitary technician to communal guardian tracks cleanly. However, interiority remains generalized and largely unconflicted—she rarely experiences contradictory impulses or costs; each “transformation” is reported rather than felt. The realization that she is the guardian arrives as a smooth thematic reveal rather than a pressured, psychologically complex turn. As a result, change is credible but emotionally thin for a piece aiming at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motive (exhaustion with rigid repair leading to a quest for uncertainty) is clear and consistent, and the clock-tinkerer identity usefully grounds her worldview. Her change at the end—embracing improvisation and “befriending uncertainty”—is motivated by the journey’s beats, though much of it is articulated rather than dramatized. Internal contradiction (“uncertainly certain”) is named but rarely enacted in live, pressured micro-choices. The transformation costs her a prior sense of control, but that cost is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to redeem the failed search by understanding the weight of Lysander’s name—is clear, coherent, and drives every choice she makes. Her “equilibrium” self-concept is tested as she risks damaging the coin, giving her a quiet but real internal conflict. Interiority is specific to her craft and worldview rather than generic grief. The final acceptance of a transformed, not restored, tool reads as an earned shift rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motive and role are clear and consistent, and her “modestly fearless” stance informs how she listens and acts, but she remains almost entirely saintly with little contradiction or felt cost. Lyra is present mainly as a function (sorrowful, then joyful) rather than as a distinct psyche. Emotional states are described more than embodied, and we rarely see genuine struggle or error under pressure. The final “luminous ache” suggests burden but doesn’t emerge from dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and particular—his proprioceptive awareness, startle responses, and fixation on the strap feel concretely embodied rather than generic. His motivation (“mathematics of mercy”) is clearly rooted in the torture experience and consistently shapes his perceptions. The internal change at the end—reconfiguring mercy as interruption rather than ratio—is earned by the prior beats with the strap and bracing, though the realization leans a touch neat. The absence of on-page relationships limits complexity but fits the focused, solitary scope.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and consistent, and her professional competence as a “between-worlds translator” feels grounded. However, she encounters little genuine resistance, so we see few revealing micro-choices under pressure and no real internal contradiction. Her emotional responses (“heart swelled,” “motivation burned brighter”) tend toward generalized summary rather than embodied, character-specific texture. The final shift is more a reaffirmation of an already-stated purpose than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Leo is clearly sketched—competent, quietly driven, with a specific quirk (reading dust) and a consistent ethic of listening to ghosts—but he faces little real internal contradiction or strain. His "weightless burden" is named more than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The choice to help is never in doubt, so the arc is more confirmation than transformation. This keeps the character sympathetic but limits depth for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—“to compress eternity into a moment”—is clear and consistently referenced, but her interior conflict around potential costs is underdeveloped, making the rupture feel intellectually motivated more than emotionally fraught. Her actions align with her stated aim and profession, and the late pivot to “weaver of this new order” tracks conceptually. However, we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure; she moves from intent to execution with little hesitance or irrationality. The result is a strong conceptual character whose psychological texture feels somewhat thin for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—reimagining the civilization and redeeming, in a way, her failed revolution—but her interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The “burnished sorrow” is evocative yet largely abstract, with few concrete, embodied moments under pressure. Her key realization about why her revolution failed lands a bit too neatly, without being forced by a hard choice on the page. The relationship with Professor Kael remains schematic, so we never see her values tested directly in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s motivation and general temperament are clear, and the truth-test via the covenant of rust gives him a credible constraint, but he experiences almost no sustained internal conflict or genuine doubt. His emotional life is mostly summarized through purpose and resolve rather than embodied ambivalence or contradiction. The townsman functions purely as a plot device without depth or distinct voice. The ending claims a large personal and spiritual victory, but we have seen little of Elian’s inner cost or blind spots to earn that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, ritual, and inner shift are clearly motivated and particular, and her psychometric experiences map cleanly onto her choices. However, her emotional path is relatively smooth—there’s little sense of contradictory impulse (fear vs compulsion, rationalism vs surrender) playing simultaneously in the peak beats. The decision to leave the vials closed and abandon the compass reads earned but low-cost on the page. More embodied hesitation or competing drives in the lagoon scene would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—an artist seeking form who’s jolted into a deeper inquiry when technology fails—and her choice to ignore the revived GPS at the end feels earned. Her interiority is particular enough (watching hands, tools, and gestures) to escape generic “creative crisis” territory. However, we get more articulated insight than embodied contradiction; we’re told she is “perpetually learning,” but we rarely see a live tug-of-war between doubt, fear, and drive on the page. The emotional arc is persuasive but not yet rich in layered, conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her quiet drive is convincingly shown through long-term effort and focused attention. However, her interiority rarely contains true contradiction or sharp ambivalence; she moves steadily toward understanding with little genuine friction. Emotional states are mostly summarized (“felt a surge of umbral tenderness,” “feeling the weight of unanswered questions”) rather than deeply embodied. The final sense of completeness is earned but comes at low visible cost, keeping the arc modest rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her embodied experience in the vision (sand, cool air, pounding heart) grounds her. However, her internal conflict between truth and comfort is mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The ghostly woman functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a pressuring, individuated character. The final resolve to share the findings feels credible but emotionally under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s motivation and principles are clear and consistent, and his actions align with them throughout. However, his interiority leans toward essayistic statement (“His motivation solidified: to foster a civilization that valued effort over entitlement”) rather than embodied, conflicting emotion. There’s little genuine contradiction or vulnerability under pressure, so the final commitment feels more affirmed than earned. The lack of another on-page character also limits relational pressure on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s vocation, habits, and reverence for emotion are clearly established and consistent, and his final vow feels motivated by what we’ve seen. However, his inner life is largely summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses; we’re told his disquiet and responsibility rather than seeing them tested in a concrete, pressurized choice. The third-grade memory does personalize him but functions more as exposition than as a crucible for internal conflict. Overall he reads specific and coherent, but not yet deeply conflicted or risk-exposed.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motivation (reopening the gateway and experiencing “borrowed time”) is clear and consistent, but largely told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. She meets no serious internal resistance; there’s very little sense of competing impulses or genuine doubt as the vortex destabilizes. Her competence reads high and untested, so success feels smooth rather than hard-won. The closing sense of change (“the inheritance now flowed through her”) is asserted more than earned through prior internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motive—favoring listening over noise—is clear and consistent, and it plausibly drives her choice to reject the siren. However, her inner life remains largely summarized; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real struggle in the moment of decision. Emotional states read as calm and declarative even at “zero hour,” which blunts complexity. The role evolution from tester to innovator is stated rather than dramatically earned beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s motives and inner life are clear—loneliness, spiritual curiosity, and a desire to find strength in vulnerability—but they’re expressed mostly in generalized, reflective language. We get few concrete, pressured micro-choices beyond watching the meteors, using the glass, and reframing his role. Internal contradictions (e.g., wanting solitude yet fearing it) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final shift from “janitor” to “guardian of moments” is emotionally legible but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The recluse has a clear, consistent motivation and a distinct temperament (astonished yet calm, observant), and his choice to open the box is aligned with that. However, there is little genuine internal contradiction or felt cost; he never seems truly torn, only contemplative. Emotions are mostly labeled rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic ways (“his nature was tranquilly perceptive” is told more than shown). The closing sense of peace feels somewhat granted rather than wrestled toward.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding the “texture” of time—is clear and consistently tied to her actions, from decoding the urn shard to running weekly gatherings. However, her emotional life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, with few embodied or contradictory reactions under pressure. The “borrowed-time timekeeper” concept is evocative but never quite tested in ways that force hard choices or visible cost. Leo functions more as a plot-delivery device than a fully pressuring presence, which softens relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and coherently expressed in both perception and action, and his interaction with the child nicely externalizes his inner ethos. However, he is almost entirely free of contradiction or blind spots; he moves from belief to enactment without friction. Emotional beats land, but they are gentle and tidy, with little sense of genuine struggle under pressure. The child functions more as a receptive foil than a character exerting real counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her decades-long caretaking plus the diagnosis credibly drive her decision to remake the orchard. However, she experiences almost no visible internal contradiction—her “brazen calm” never wavers into doubt, anger, or fear, which flattens potential complexity. Her emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied in specific, character-particular sensations. The final choice to spend her last days observing the grove is coherent but feels more serene than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and traits (“luminous skeptic,” academically rebellious, obsessed with biochemistry over linguistics) are clear and drive every action, from designing the pilgrimage to reading the projection. What’s missing at this tier is real internal contradiction or cost; her skepticism and draw toward the tower never come into sharp conflict, so her arc feels more like confirmation than transformation. Emotional experience stays largely in a cool, conceptual register rather than embodied struggle. The final realization is motivated but a bit tidy, without a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coachman’s core motivation is clear and consistent—reclaiming a battlefield through gardening—and his actions all align with that goal. However, interiority stays generalized and serene; we get little embodied emotion or contradiction beyond quiet devotion, so he feels emblematic more than fully human. There’s no real internal conflict or cost to his choice to plant; he never wavers or pays a visible personal price. The final stance (satisfaction as he departs) is earned but low-pressure, so the arc reads as steady continuation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Baron’s core motive—bridging the gap to Elara—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through his attention to the leaf and the cylinder. His interiority is vivid (“translated sound into shape, silence into intention”), and his final choice to leave the cabin grows organically from what we’ve seen. However, his internal conflict (between the pain of closeness and the safety of distance) is more stated than dramatized, so the decision feels relatively unopposed. A bit more friction or hesitation at the moment of departure would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent—turning confusion into exploration—and his final choice to abandon his assigned vigil for a self-chosen quest feels earned. Interiority is reasonably specific (the warming compass rose, the pull of the star), though the emotional palette leans heavily on a single axis of awe/resolve without much contradiction or messiness. There’s little sense of genuine internal conflict about leaving his post, which flattens what could be a fraught moral or psychological turn. Nonetheless, his actions align with the established drive and culminate in a credible stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation and ethos are clear and consistent, and the “chivalrous thief/apprentice of wonder” angle gives him specificity. However, he encounters almost no genuine resistance, and his emotions never seriously fray; he “felt no fear” even at the climax, which flattens interior conflict. Micro-choices (bowing to the guardian, how he handles the ritual) do reveal values but are rarely pressured. The final “change” is more an acquisition of a new wonder than a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to become a “historian of small gestures” and to unbind her own survivor’s guilt—is clear and consistently dramatized through her ritualized walking and attention to minor acts of kindness. Her interiority is particular enough to feel individual (crisis actor who is also a real survivor), though key descriptors like “benevolently ruthless” and “survivor’s guilt” lean toward label rather than fully embodied contradiction. The internal change toward self-forgiveness is earned but somewhat tidy, with little real resistance on the page. Still, her choices and perceptions track well with her articulated goal and past.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—redefining “home” after trauma—is clear and consistent, and her avoidance vs. awakening curiosity around the stone gives her a credible internal arc. Her emotional life is mostly conveyed through metaphor and summary rather than sharply embodied contradiction, so she reads a bit archetypal rather than fully individuated. The shift from using mercury-glass as escape to using it as a tool of integration is earned and legible. I missed at least one concrete, irrational micro-choice under pressure that would expose messier flaws beyond sorrow and longing.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s guilt, exile, and need for absolution are clear and consistent, and his chess-trained mind and “productive fidgeting” give him a distinct interior texture. His change—from self-laceration to acceptance—is motivated by concrete discoveries (the hidden pattern, the reinterpreted “test”). However, the emotional arc resolves a bit too cleanly into articulated insight (“He had needed to fail in order to learn true strategy”), softening the sense of lingering contradiction or cost. A touch more mess or resistance at the end would deepen his complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and nature (“defiant,” “innocently mischievous,” committed to refracted truth) are clear and consistently dramatized in her choice to subvert the ritual through poetry. However, her interiority is largely stated rather than embodied under pressure, and we rarely feel contradictory impulses or genuine doubt as the bell approaches. Her relationship to the listeners has emotional impact (they sigh, weep) but doesn’t quite crystallize into a relational crucible that forces a costly choice. The ending registers as her calm endurance rather than a hard-won, conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian’s core motive—saving a world of fraying memories—is clear and drives his actions, but his advertised “uncertainty” never meaningfully complicates his choices. Once the dive begins he functions as a straightforwardly resolute hero, with little internal contradiction or genuine hesitation. Emotions are reasonably embodied (burning lungs, stinging eyes) but often summarized in elevated abstractions (“dire enchantment”) rather than rendered in character-specific texture. The change at the end (from uncertain seeker to fulfilled custodian of memories) is declared more than earned through layered interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (the old promise and her nostalgia) is clearly articulated and her actions align with it, especially in packing the unpainted shell and then choosing to leave the painted one behind. However, much of her conflict is reported rather than dramatized; lines like “her nostalgia had been a cage” summarize instead of showing contradictory impulses in-scene. The epiphany lands but feels somewhat tidy and abstract, with limited embodied struggle in the cave moment itself. Still, she reads as a distinct, coherent character with a believable inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is lucid and particular—calling her brother home and proving her “whisper” thesis—and her ritual choice feels consistent with her years of “quiet study.” However, she moves through the process with almost no ambivalence or internal friction; we don’t see competing impulses (hope vs. fear of failure) acting simultaneously in scene. Her emotion is reasonably embodied via sensory focus on the vial and cork, but some states are summarized rather than dramatized (“her heart light”). The final shift (feeling the echo of his answer) is earned but relatively low-cost because she never truly risks her belief on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s singular motivation—to navigate the “geography of loss”—is clear and consistent, and her actions (building the resonator, aligning with Polaris, choosing to “Listen”) track cleanly with that drive. However, internal conflict is underplayed: she rarely hesitates, resists, or reveals contradictory impulses; she mostly enacts the voice’s guidance. The final realization that the voice was her own lands emotionally but feels a bit tidy, with limited on-page struggle leading into it. Strong interiority and object-relationship, but not yet at the level of complex, pressure-tested character work.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and rational temperament are clear and consistent, and her choice to risk the ritual feels rooted in that characterization. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract labels (“psychological safety,” “perceptual ailments”) rather than concrete, contradictory impulses in the moment of risk. We don’t see her truth-compulsion actively sabotaging her in-scene, so the main flaw remains somewhat conceptual rather than embodied. The final shift to “clear, unchained intention” is earned but emotionally under-textured for this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply characterized—his sea-glass rituals, conversations with gulls, and solitary vocation all cohere with his compulsion to decode the stranger. Motivation is clear and consistent, and the ending shift from hollow loneliness to chosen solitude feels earned. However, there’s little genuine internal contradiction or real cost; he never seriously wavers or faces pressure that tests his need to investigate. Some late phrasing (“His isolation was now a choice”) tells the emotional state instead of dramatizing it through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s grief, promise to Mara, and empirically grounded temperament create a coherent, specific interiority, and his micro-choices (pocketing the chip, following the ants, refusing the doorway) all align with that core. The final renunciation reads emotionally plausible, with a visible cost in the opportunity he gives up. However, his internal conflict at the doorway is resolved quickly and cleanly, with little messy contradiction or irrationality on the page. A touch more embodied, conflicting impulse at the peak could push this to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation and arc from disenchantment to accepting guardianship are clear and causally supported, and her small physical choices (shedding robes, touching the starlight, turning back) track with that drive. However, her interior conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene—her disenchantment, fear, and transformation are told in clean but generalized terms. The guardian figure is intriguing but underdeveloped, functioning more as an atmosphere device than a true relational crucible. The final realization comes quickly and feels a bit like an imposed role (“vessel chosen”) rather than something emerging from deeply particularized flaws or contradictions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her adjustment in response to Kael’s revelation feels motivated rather than arbitrary. However, her emotional life leans abstract (“density of presence,” “scientifically romantic heart”) rather than concretely embodied, which mutes the impact of her change. Internal conflict is lightly sketched—she shifts frames smoothly, with little resistance or cost on the page. The friendship with Kael has warmth but never truly becomes a crucible that pressures a hard choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and particular—jealousy of past selves, “feral nostalgia,” and jaded wonder all feel specific rather than generic. His core motive (to distill chaos into narrative) is consistent and drives the concrete act of inscribing the scroll. Internal contradiction—resenting and longing for his earlier selves while trying to exert control through lucid chronicle—is well dramatized. The closing endurance (living with the grave as “just another part of the story”) feels earned, though the emotional price remains mostly internal rather than tested against another person or harder external constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and arc—from disoriented practitioner to someone who “fastens hope” without scent—are clear and coherent, and her occupation meaningfully shapes her psychology. However, her inner conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in specific moments of doubt or misstep, so the transformation feels gently asserted instead of hard-won. The repairman functions effectively as a catalyst but remains an almost purely symbolic figure with little individuating detail beyond his craft. The final shift feels earned enough for this length but could use one sharper, embodied moment of resistance or fear to deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific—she wants to alchemize trauma into narrative, and her anxiety is concretely embodied in the trembling quill and crystallizing ink. The conflict between rigidity/fear and the desire to release and transform is sustained through the scene and leads credibly to her calmer stance at the end. However, some emotional states are summarized in slightly abstract terms (“scars etched into her soul,” “shed another layer of shame”) rather than always grounded in fresh, character-particular embodiment. The change feels earned but not deeply complicated by contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, tools, and belief in “imperfect miracles” give her a distinct, coherent profile, and her actions in the ritual follow cleanly from that setup. However, her interior conflict is underdeveloped: the job “weighs on her,” but we see almost no contradictory impulses or emotional degradation as pressure rises. Maestro Alistair and Isabella function mainly as elegant concepts (rumor-haunted composer; girl in the roots) rather than individuated people. The ending gives Elara a quiet endurance cost (she walks away marked by her calling) but that cost is more told than dramatically earned in specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The witness’s core motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract—he never feels like more than a symbolic functionary. There is virtually no on-page internal conflict or meaningful doubt; “confronting his own doubts and fears” is asserted rather than dramatized. His final transformation reads as conceptually earned but emotionally underdeveloped, with minimal sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.0)
    The shepherd’s core motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to know what clocks “really” measure—and his actions (calibrating, investigating the glint, adjusting the auxiliary device, stopping the count) align with that. However, his inner life stays fairly one-note: contemplative, curious, calm, with little felt contradiction or emotional risk. The final realization costs him nothing visible beyond a quiet shift in belief, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned. This reads as a well-drawn premise character rather than a fully pressured person.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s professional competence and philosophical drive are clear, but her emotional life and contradictions under pressure remain underdeveloped. The line “Her motivation, however, was deeply personal: to understand the physics of letting go” is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Her “change” at the end feels more like a smooth confirmation of a pre-held belief than a hard-won shift with on-page cost. The lack of real internal struggle as she decides to soften the barriers keeps this below top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner conflict are clear, rooted in her father’s paradox—mathematical clarity vs. compulsive self-destruction—and this drives her journey credibly. Her emotional life is rendered with specificity in images (lantern, subway scrawls, the journal) rather than pure labels. However, some of her realizations verge on tidy, rational epiphany (“to widen perspectives responsibly meant…”) that smooths over messier contradictions. The final decision to teach feels earned but somewhat summarized instead of pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Leo’s role and motivation are clear and consistent, and the idea of “cultivated estrangement” gives him a distinct inner stance. However, his interiority stays mostly at the level of stated purpose rather than dramatized contradiction; we seldom feel his own lingering wounds or ambivalence in embodied terms. Elara is moving but somewhat generic—her grief is summarized rather than made particular. The final note that he was once like her hints at a richer arc but arrives as exposition rather than earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s vocation and motive—to preserve “the weight of small moments” and renew her grandmother’s covenant—are clear and consistent, and her emotions are reasonably embodied in sensory memory. However, she encounters almost no resistance: the ritual works smoothly, her internal state is largely unconflicted, and there’s little visible cost or moral tension. “Haunted euphoria” is named rather than deeply dramatized in contradictory impulses. The result is a coherent but emotionally safe portrait rather than a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply etched: her disaster-relief background, elusive habits, “desperately jocular” facade, and loneliness-driven mission all cohere and directly inform her choices. Leo is more lightly drawn but still credible as a desperate, skeptical seeker whose emotional shift tracks with the scene. The story earns a modest internal change for Elara—her loneliness “abating” as the network forms—anchored in prior behavior. A bit more embodied contradiction in her interiority under pressure (beyond the stated facade) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to find the stillpoint as a way through grief) is clear, specific, and coherently drives every choice. Her interiority is richly embodied in sensory terms adapted to her blindness and her unusual perception. The final acceptance of the stillpoint-as-state feels earned by the preceding journey. There could be a touch more contradictory impulse on the page (e.g., doubt vs. belief in the stillpoint) to push into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt, “confident uncertainty,” and compulsion to reinterpret her error are cleanly motivated and consistent, and the pen as a talisman grounds her interiority in a concrete object. Her shift from solitary penance to entering into a risky dialogue with the anomaly reads as an earned evolution rather than a flip. However, her internal conflict (terror vs duty/curiosity) stays mostly conceptual; we get trembling hands but not much degradation of thought or more jagged, contradictory impulses under peak pressure. A slightly more embodied, unruly response to the anomaly’s “reply” would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s loneliness and “joyful sorrow” are clear and consistent, and the advisor’s motive to disrupt his isolation is legible and rooted in character. However, interiority leans on abstract summaries (“joyful sorrow,” “weight of silence”) rather than specific, character-particular sensations or contradictions in key beats. The relationship is affecting, especially when the advisor passes the camera and later fades, but it progresses smoothly without much friction or messy ambivalence. The final change—Elian’s new stance toward silence—is motivated but could be deepened with more concrete, idiosyncratic emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s core motivation (atoning for past arson and upholding an ancestral promise) is clear and consistent, and his shift from destruction to preservation is legible. However, much of his internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in specific, pressured moments, so contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page. Emotional states skew abstract (“volcanic tenderness,” “singular purpose”) rather than embodied in concrete sensations or behaviors. The final transformation feels earned conceptually but under-tested experientially.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (turning the curse of entangled memories into a shared dream) is clear and consistent, and her drumming is a concrete expression of that drive. However, she is rendered almost entirely as a sainted emblem of sorrow and hope, with little contradictory impulse or moral complication on the page. The “quietly rebellious” stance never really conflicts with any darker urge, fear, or selfish desire. The final shift into “steadfast guardian” feels logical but a bit too frictionless, with limited visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is clearly sketched—a calm, competent labyrinth worker whose belief in “whispers” drives her choices—and Kael’s shift from bluster to curiosity tracks cleanly, if a bit swiftly. However, interior conflict is minimal; Elara never doubts, strains, or missteps, so her arc reads more like a demonstration of a fixed philosophy than a pressured evolution. The relationship dynamic between her and Kael is readable and shifts status believably as she mentors him. The cost of her stance (social, emotional, or practical) remains largely abstract rather than embodied in a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and her calm, ritualistic actions under pressure feel particular to her. However, her inner life remains largely one-note—devoted, serene, empathic—with little contradictory impulse or real moral friction. The hinted cost of her work (endless, lonely vigilance) is not deeply dramatized on the page. The child’s presence shapes her tactics but doesn’t expose new facets of her beyond the same serene resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and core traits are clear, consistent, and particular (chess coach, quiet strategist, nurturing doubt), and her actions align well with that core. However, she faces little on-page internal contradiction or fear; there’s no real moment where her commitment visibly costs her something personal. Her empathy via “hearing unspoken words” gives her some specificity but doesn’t complicate her psyche under pressure. The ending endurance feels more asserted than paid for in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s interiority is specific (grace hidden under dock labor, “combative tenderness,” guarded heart) and her choice to follow the call feels motivated by long-standing restlessness plus the pirate’s promise. The internal conflict is present but often summarized rather than fully dramatized, so her final surrender to “true nature” feels a touch too smooth. We never see concrete ties to the dock life or other people, which softens the felt cost of leaving. Still, for this length, she reads as a distinct, coherent character with a real, if somewhat idealized, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s inner contradiction—complying with the Mandate while secretly carving sorrow and betraying neighbors—feels specific and grounded. Her grief is embodied in tactile choices (whittling, handling the bouquet) rather than just labeled. The arc is more an earned stasis than a change, but the moral cost of that endurance is legible. Slight repetition of stated motives (“cultivate lightness,” “emotional void”) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s core drive—to cross forbidden boundaries and reinterpret the ban—is clear and consistent, and his actions align with that motive. However, he remains more archetype than individuated person; “cloud-shadow poet” functions as a role with almost no concrete, character-particular interiority or embodied emotion. There is little sense of internal contradiction or real fear as he crosses a threshold “impassable for generations,” so the emotional cost feels muted. The final shift from observer to “agent of transformation” is asserted more than dramatized through distinctive thought or behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s core desire and limitation are clear and consistent, and his choice to trade the concertina plus engage with the painting challenge tracks well. However, his inner conflict between craving color and already “finding beauty in imperfection” is mostly asserted rather than dramatized as a live contradiction in the scene. Maestra is intriguing but functions more as a calm archetype and system-deliverer than as a pressured character, so the relationship never fully becomes a crucible. The final realization, while emotionally apt, feels slightly too tidy and low-friction for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the “texture of connection”—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the pivot from isolating analysis to projecting sound outward. Her “powerfully gentle” nature is dramatized in her patience and refusal to force the bells. Internal conflict (is isolation enough vs. needing a larger listening context) is present but fairly understated. Emotional states skew conceptual rather than bodily, which slightly flattens her under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief, craft, and gradual reawakening are coherent and specific, and her choices (following coordinates, reopening the sealed room, changing her work) track logically. However, her inner life is largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so we don’t feel contradictory impulses or real resistance at key turns. The transition from “rock bottom” to quietly purposeful healer is thematically right but emotionally smoothed over, with little messy irrationality. Her relationship to the visiting woman is touching but one-note, offering limited relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara has a clear, specific motivation and vocation, and the repeated gestures with the cards and tape give her some textured interiority, but she rarely faces an actual on-page dilemma that forces a difficult choice or visible cost. Her fear of “another, greater unraveling” is told more than dramatized, so contradictory impulses (stability vs. obsession, duty vs. self-preservation) stay largely conceptual. Leo’s presence adds a relational frame but he exerts almost no pressure; he listens but doesn’t truly challenge or reconfigure her stance. The ending shift—mystery becoming “a guide rather than a ghost”—feels more like a declarative summary than a change earned through dramatized micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to purify nostalgia to heal modern sorrows—is clear and consistent, and her willingness to pay a price tracks logically to the end. However, her interiority leans on generalized labels (“anguished joy,” “weight of centuries”) rather than concrete, character-particular perception, so she feels more like an archetype than a fully individuated person. The “end of innocence” is asserted rather than dramatized through a specific, resisted micro-choice. Her emotions rarely manifest as contradictory impulses in the moment; we’re told she’s torn, but we don’t feel her nearly backing away or failing.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—“to preserve the shape of hope”—and her role as noticer is well embodied in how she moves through the Aerie and studies footage. The final regret is a credible extension of her earlier convictions rather than an imposed twist. However, internal contradiction under pressure (wanting honest pain vs wanting ordered hope) is mostly saved for the ending instead of being dramatized in earlier micro-choices. She stays largely in one emotional register of calm competence until the last beat, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict between hurt pride and ingrained compassion is specific, credible, and sustained (“tightrope walk… to balance the scalding need for self-respect with the deep, ingrained pull of compassion”). The shedding of layers—naivete, bitterness, fear—tracks a convincing emotional progression rather than a single neat epiphany. Her micro-choices (not reattaching the tail, deciding she will still open the door tomorrow) align with that interiority and reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Some phrasing drifts toward abstracted/therapeutic language (“reconstruction of resilience”) which slightly flattens her particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and specific—his rawness after anesthesia, the compulsive bandage-picking, and his relationship to scars all feel character-particular. Motivation is clear (compulsion toward “closure” and understanding scars) and ties coherently to his decision to dig. However, we get little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure; once he commits to tunneling, he encounters no real internal resistance, so the final acceptance costs him relatively little. The “closure seeker who only opened wounds” line is excellent but slightly under-exploited as an ongoing, dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—this is a woman professionally and obsessively oriented toward “where unused love is stored”—and her interior perceptions feel specific to her craft. However, she encounters almost no resistance, and we see little contradictory impulse or cost; she glides from curiosity to purpose with minimal friction. Emotional states are embodied in images (“cool cellulose felt like skin”) but not in conflicted choices. The final commitment to be a guardian of unused love feels attractive but not sufficiently tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation and arc are clear and consistent—freeing trapped creativity through celestial alignment—but she reads more as a lyric archetype than a fully embodied individual. Her emotional life is largely summarized (“shadowed rapture,” “bittersweet ecstasy”) rather than dramatized in specific bodily or behavioral terms. The hearing-unspoken-words trait promises rich contradiction but never quite manifests as in-scene struggle or bad decisions. Her final transformation into “bard of the stars” feels earned conceptually but carries little visible personal cost or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s function and motivation are clear and consistent—her role as a “dreamless freight guard” cultivating sparks tracks cleanly to her actions in the archive. The emotional life is somewhat abstract and heavily conceptual, but we do get a sense of cost (“each effort drained her, leaving her more hollow”) and a credible before/after shift from emptiness to a tentative embrace of dreams. Internal contradiction is present but underexploited: the tension between being dreamless and ending by welcoming dreams could carry sharper, more embodied conflict. Overall, she reads as specific and purposeful, but the psychology is more sketched through idea than dramatized through concrete feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and consistent—she’s a seeker of cognitive expansion, and her choices (following the wind-harmonics, trusting the gear, accepting translocation) all align with that. What’s missing at this level is real internal contradiction or felt risk: she rarely seems torn, and her enlightenment costs her little on the page beyond disorientation. The final shift from “probable miracle” as inconvenience to “dance of discovery” is earned but emotionally smooth, not hard-won. Strong, specific interiority, but not yet at the depth or complexity elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner shift from fear-bound to self-chosen journey are clear and earned, with the broken leash and the glowing star as strong externalizations of her internal arc. However, her interiority leans toward abstract phrasing (“unused courage,” “untethered”) rather than more idiosyncratic, character-specific textures. The guides function more as archetypal presences than fully individuated characters, which suits the fable-like mode but limits psychological depth. The final stance—alone but not lonely—feels credible given the walk we’ve witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation and inner stance are clear and consistent—his drive to understand the “cost of safety” coheres with his actions from pocketing the bolt to haunting the archives. However, his emotional life is often told in abstract terms (“moral clarity solidifying”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or contradictory impulses in-scene. We rarely see him under immediate pressure making a contested choice; his internal conflict remains largely conceptual. The final choice to remain as a witness is motivated, but the felt cost could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lorian’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his meticulous work and final confrontation, and the “diminutive titan” paradox gives him a memorable silhouette. However, his inner life is largely unwavering righteousness; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. Theron is a flat, functional antagonist whose arrogance is stated more than embodied. The final choice to activate the rune feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with little visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent—ecological loss and the need to understand vanished “paths” drive both their career and present task. The tapping habit and the salvaged atlas are strong, character-specific choices that give them texture. However, internal conflict remains relatively low-grade; the shift from doubt to renewed purpose feels a little tidy and under-contested. The emotional turn lands, but with limited sense of cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear, with nice concrete anchors (bare feet, opera glasses, awkward gait), and her shift from uncertain to resolute tracks plausibly. However, motivation is sometimes told in flat summary (“Her motivation was simple”) rather than dramatized under pressure, and internal conflict remains fairly low-friction. The final “unwavering purpose” verges on an easy epiphany because no competing impulse significantly resists it in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly motivated—her insurgent stance toward the council and her desire to “evolve tradition with intent” are consistent across the piece. Her plant-telepathy is well integrated into how she thinks and acts, not just labeled. However, her internal conflict is under-pressured: once the visions arrive, there’s no serious doubt, temptation, or cost that complicates her choice to share them. The grandmother aspect adds texture but could cut deeper into embodied frailty or generational tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is specific, embodied, and motivated: the drone strike wedding survivor whose gardening skill, freeze responses, and rituals (names on the wind) all align under pressure. Her internal contradiction—nurturing life while carrying intense dread—lands clearly in the aircraft-trigger beat. However, the language of her self-understanding sometimes slips into therapy jargon (“somatic markers,” “integrated”) that flattens mystery rather than revealing character-particular thought. The final stance feels earned but a bit over-explained instead of discovered in action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interiority is rich and specific, his shame, doubt, and eventual reorientation toward being a “cartographer of souls” emerging convincingly from the memories he revisits. Motivation is continuous and legible: escape expectations, interrogate his failures, descend into darkness to reassemble himself. The epiphany feels earned by the prior threads, though the emotional register stays fairly uniform and leans occasionally on abstract phrasing rather than fully embodied contradiction. A relationship crucible is absent, but that’s appropriate to the single-POV isolation frame.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and particular—an almost monastic need to understand time dilation—with a nicely specific emotional palette (“serene anger”) that feels lived-in rather than generic. His discipline and “consciously wild” nature track believably with his methodical, risky experiment. However, internal contradiction (wild vs. controlled, fury vs. serenity) is more told than dramatized; we rarely see impulses collide in real time. The closing shift from searching to acceptance lands, but the cost of that shift feels lightly sketched rather than fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation (truth vs. preservation) is clear and consistent, and her choice to upload feels psychologically plausible. However, her interiority is often summarized in generic terms (“bravely conflicted,” “need for justice”) rather than dramatized in idiosyncratic, embodied detail. The conflict resolves too smoothly—fear of vanishing like past archivists never meaningfully degrades her thinking or slows her hand. The final shift from conflict to certainty lands, but the emotional cost is lightly sketched rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core motivation and pacifist stance are clear and consistent, and the contrast with her bounty hunter father gives her a defined axis. However, she is rendered mostly as an emblem of serenity rather than a fully conflicted person; there’s almost no on-page contradictory impulse or moment where her pacifism is genuinely strained. Emotional states are largely summarized (“her pacifist heart unwavering”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or fraught micro-choices. The closing endurance feels more assumed than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s motivation and temperament are clear—patient, cool-headed, quietly determined—but his inner life feels relatively one-note. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or meaningful doubt under pressure. His competence is consistently affirmed, so his success carries limited emotional cost. The rail spike mediates his feelings nicely, but that embodiment doesn’t deepen his psychology beyond “calm resolve.”

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivations (truth vs filial loyalty) are clear and consistent, and her use of “proof by contradiction” is a character-specific way to avoid messy confrontation. Her interiority is particular—ink-smudged proofs, family secrets, the weight of legacy—rather than generic angst. The shift from wanting to exonerate her father to choosing to expose him feels earned and forecloses a path with visible emotional cost. A slightly heavier embodiment of her emotional turmoil under peak pressure (beyond trembling fingers) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s guilt and special gift give her a strong, specific core, and her motivation to quiet the haunted firmware is clear and consistent. However, much of her struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so we rarely see contradictory impulses play out moment-to-moment under pressure. The final acceptance (“the guilt no longer a sharp sting but a dull ache she could carry”) feels somewhat tidy given how little resistance we’ve watched her navigate directly. More embodied, in-the-moment decision-making would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament (“whimsical,” chalk-stained, socially perceptive) are clear and consistently expressed through her decision to answer dread with art rather than argument. Her empathy for the others and refusal to defend herself verbally when challenged feel character-specific. However, interior conflict is relatively mild—she rarely seems truly torn or destabilized, which softens the impact of her final calm. The change at the end (carrying a piece of meaning forward) is emotionally credible but comes with little visible cost or contradiction resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara/Aeliana has a coherent inner life—trauma, mission, and the desire to protect empathy—culminating in a well-motivated self-renaming. However, the interiority leans abstract and thematic (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) rather than concretely embodied, which blunts specificity. Internal conflict (duty vs. retrocognitive imprisonment) is present but resolved relatively cleanly, without much messy contradiction. The cost of changing her name and stance is felt but could be more sharply dramatized in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing and encore-hunger are vivid and specific, and her actions (using the coin, persisting through resistance) align with those motives. However, internal contradiction—cling to applause vs accept release—is more implied than dramatized, so we rarely see competing impulses in real-time. Her emotions are often rendered through lush description rather than embodied, conflicted reactions. The final fulfillment feels earned but a bit too straightforward emotionally for top-tier literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alex’s motives are clear and consistent—an “affectionate skeptic” trying to reach Mara through memory—and his actions (retrieving the geode, devising a method, committing to the light painting) align with that drive. Interiority has specific, embodied beats (the tingling after the shock, the feel of Mara’s hand), though his skepticism vs. hope conflict could be dramatized more sharply rather than mostly stated. The final shift from doubt to “willowglass hope” is earned by prior setup but stays emotionally smooth, with little visible self-deception or real risk. The relationship with Mara is vivid in memory but one-sided here, limiting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kaelen’s motive—to become the voice of the unknown—is clear and consistently pursued, and his choice to focus on the fossil and follow the glowing pathways coherently advances that drive. However, he encounters almost no real resistance or dilemma, and there’s little sense of internal contradiction or cost in his transformation from observer to interpreter. Emotional states are often labeled (“motivation surged”) rather than embodied in character-particular ways. The final realization that he has “achieved [his] goal” feels somewhat unearned because it isn’t tested against any meaningful doubt or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    The hourglass turner’s core motivation and role are clear and consistent, and her calm, methodical agency is well established. However, her emotional life remains mostly summarized and singularly “quietly inspired,” with little contradiction or felt fear given the alleged doom at stake. Internal conflict is minimal; she never doubts, hesitates, or encounters a value-clash that forces a costly choice. The final sense of achievement is earned in plot terms but not deeply earned emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s core motivation (redemption, “fix what was broken”) is clear and consistent, and his burned-spy status gives him a concrete drive. However, his internal conflict between prudence and daring is mostly stated rather than dramatized in specific micro-choices under pressure. Anya’s shift from fear to courage is functional but thinly rendered, with little individuating detail. The final sacrifice feels earned enough, but emotional texture remains somewhat generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    The coachman’s motivation and history—the palimpsest promise, the grandmother’s needle, the desire to “distill complexity into essence”—are coherent and consistent. His interiority, however, leans abstract and repetitive rather than sharply embodied, and conflicting impulses (guilt vs. avoidance vs. hope) are more told than dramatized. The final shift toward self-forgiveness is understandable and foreshadowed but emotionally undercomplicated, with little sense of what he might lose by choosing this path. The result is solid characterization without the textured contradiction or cost that would make it truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s sensibility is coherent—zen discipline, tactile awareness as a potter, and curiosity about “places that resist change” all line up with his choices. His interiority is gently specific (tracing hive wood, aligning breath with sun) rather than generic. However, his emotional progression is relatively smooth and unconflicted; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or cost to his realization. The closing shift from observer to “participant in this eternal now” is thematically apt but comes with minimal dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation—to reflect light into dark corners and reaffirm her purpose after loss—is clear and consistent, and the heirloom tool ties her to a specific history. However, her internal conflict remains soft; she feels “ache” and is “wistfully pragmatic,” but we rarely see contradictory impulses genuinely pulling her in opposing directions in the moment. Her choices (row or not, reflect light or not) never feel at risk, so no path is truly foreclosed. The endurance at the end reads more as quiet affirmation than as an earned stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the choice to remain as guardian credibly grows from her encounter with the stone circle and visions. However, her inner life stays relatively smooth and declarative—she rarely shows simultaneous contradictory impulses under real pressure, and the transition from “raw and unsettled” to “at peace” feels somewhat tidy. Emotional states are often labeled rather than embodied in idiosyncratic ways. The cost of her final stance (loneliness, grief) is implied but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and longing are clearly drawn and integrated: the ghostwriter who keeps others’ secrets and yearns vaguely “to rejoin something she had lost” is specific and convincing. Her micro-choices—going to the pond, deciding to build the spiral, inviting others to whisper secrets, then finally stepping into the labyrinth herself—track her internal move from distance to vulnerability. The comparison between the nest and her letters is effective in revealing how she understands her own emotional labor. The only limitation is that the peak realization comes a bit smoothly, with little visible resistance or mess, which slightly softens the sense of hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aris’s vocation, obsession with the “tricksters,” and willingness to defy Evans are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (waiting until the building is empty, bypassing protocols) track well with his motives. However, his internal conflict is thin: once the plan is conceived, there’s little genuine hesitation or contradictory impulse on the page. Evans provides a legible status dynamic and political counterpressure but feels somewhat archetypal. The closing “guardian” stance is earned enough but edges toward heroic packaging rather than a complex, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s core contradiction (claustrophobic yet driven to explore) is strong, and her motivation to find the key is consistently articulated, but her interiority remains mostly told in abstract terms rather than embodied in specific, pressured choices. Claustrophobia and “wistful rebellion” are reiterated as labels rather than dramatized with concrete sensations or irrational impulses. Her transformation at the end (“no longer controlled by her claustrophobia”) reads more as a declared epiphany than the culmination of on-page struggle. The keeper, as the only other character, functions purely as an expositional mouthpiece without real relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s condition, vocation, and methodical temperament are clear and interesting, and her decision to investigate the quarry feels motivated. However, her interiority leans toward abstract summary (“a motivation she barely understood herself”) rather than embodied, scene-level conflict. We’re told she wants to awaken empathy but see little friction or contradictory impulse on the page as she works. The final “understanding” of an accident emerges cleanly but a bit too easily, without enough dramatized struggle to fully earn that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and the “nervously confident” quality is carried through from arrival to final presentation. However, her interiority leans on labels (“spongey dread”) more than dramatized contradiction, so we rarely see competing impulses clash in real time. Roy functions mostly as a gatekeeper who softens quickly, providing limited relational pressure. The final peace she feels is earned enough by causality, but the emotional cost along the way is smoothed rather than thorny or particular.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear, particularized motive (to make sense of the hitchhiker and “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) and a distinct observational habit, and his shift from haunted to illuminated is legible. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: there’s little sense of competing impulses or real resistance to the epiphany. Emotional states are often named in abstract terms (“luminous disbelief,” “radiant awe”) rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. The final change feels more granted by the premise than painfully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s motivation (break the inherited cycle of robbery/fraud) is clear and coherently tied to his history with the robber father and the failed startup. His calm, observant demeanor and ethical pivot in persuading the squatter feel consistent and grounded. However, we rarely feel contradictory impulses in real time—his shift from possible complicity to moral clarity is more asserted than dramatized, and the emotional cost of letting go of his father’s legacy is told rather than embodied. The squatter is mostly a function, with limited individuality or pressure beyond initial defensiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation—promise to her mentor and desire to ease collective suffering—is clear and consistent, but she rarely faces on-page pressure that forces difficult or contradictory impulses into view. Her interiority leans toward summary and abstraction (“shared burdens of history”) rather than embodied, idiosyncratic feeling. The “healing warmth” at the end feels more declared than earned through dramatized struggle. Change is present (from doubt to confident healer) but arrives via exposition rather than hard-won, micro-choiced conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (breaking generational silence / finding the hidden truth of herself) is clear and rooted in her guarded temperament, and her choices consistently follow from that. However, her “guardedness” rarely produces visible hesitation or contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves in a straight, highly competent line from intent to success. Emotional shifts (from guarded to peaceful) feel somewhat summarized rather than earned through specific, pressured micro-choices. The cost of opening up is implied but not really dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (finding the intersection of dreams and healing the covenant) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and the root-bound constraint gives her a concrete, embodied limitation. Her emotional state—pain, duty, curiosity, fear—is shown through physical sensations and rooted imagery, not just labels. Internal conflict between attachment to the glade and need to step through the portal is present but resolved relatively straightforwardly, with little genuine doubt or ugly flaw. The final change (roots becoming bridges of light) is earned but comes with limited visible cost beyond generic strain and tears.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to mend a soul damaged by “bartered destinies”—is clear and consistent, and her shift from control to acceptance is legible and earned. The interaction with the keeper gives her a credible counterforce that exposes her blind spot. However, her inner life is expressed mostly in abstract terms (“patch holes in her soul,” “fractured fate”) rather than concrete, character-specific embodiment, which blunts complexity. The final surrender feels a touch neat emotionally, with limited sense of lingering contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s interiority is clear and specific—his mix of technical confidence and private insecurity, and his habit of “insulating with facts,” feels particular rather than generic. His micro-choices (deflecting toward object details, clutching the cloth, then finally pivoting to a new purpose) track well with that psychology. The emotional arc from numb shame to tentative resolve is plausible but a bit tidy, with limited visible cost at the end beyond discomfort. Mara is empathetic but largely functions as a catalyst rather than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his scholarly, patient nature is nicely aligned with his profession and tactics. However, his “haunted ambitions” are mostly told rather than dramatized; we don’t see genuine contradiction or messy struggle, just a smooth path to insight. The emotional turn from haunted to peaceful is a bit too tidy and low-cost for top-tier literary work. His change is credible but not deeply earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian’s core motivation—to preserve wonder and reconcile contradictions—is clear and consistent, but he rarely experiences friction or genuine doubt, so we see little live internal conflict. His “choices” (to smelt, to soothe, to accept) feel foregone rather than pressured, giving the character arc a static quality. Embodied emotion is muted; “wintersun serenity” is evocative but undercut by the absence of any moment where that serenity is strained. The final contentment therefore reads earned textually but not dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen has a clear professional frame and a legible internal shift from procedural detachment to valuing hope, and the bunker-inspector detail grounds him. However, his emotional journey is very smooth—there’s little contradictory impulse or real struggle once he encounters the shell. The quickness and cleanliness of his epiphany (“his motivation became clear”) makes the change feel somewhat declared rather than hard-won. We don’t see much of his flaws or blind spots pushing against this new resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific, with the river-chronicler identity and Blackwater Bend incident giving her guilt real contour. Her methodical searching of graffiti and hesitant decision to play the accordion are credible micro-choices under pressure. The contradiction between blame and the desire for absolution surfaces, but it could be embodied more in on-page conflict rather than tidy realization. The emotional turn toward self-forgiveness is slightly swift but still feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s goal and basic temperament (“cautious exuberance”) are clear and consistent, but her inner life remains relatively simple and unconflicted. We see determination and curiosity, yet almost no contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. Her emotional responses are often told in similar language rather than embodied in idiosyncratic ways. The final acceptance of the library feels earned but low-cost, more endurance than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives (duty to the Emperor vs longing for a quiet, plant-centered life) are clear, embodied, and consistently tested, especially in the “mulberry ache” and the hesitation before playing the violin. Her internal conflict is active in-scene—coffee reading, listening to the plants, weighing promise vs dream—rather than summarized. The final choice to play for propagation and accept imperial fallout feels earned by prior beats. The only shortfall is that her flaws and potential self-deception (e.g., about the Empire’s likely response) are gestured at more than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s primary motivation—to preserve one last spark of the singer’s essence—is clear and consistent, but it faces almost no on-page resistance or moral friction. Her interiority is more stated than dramatized; we’re told of her sacred duty and quiet joy, yet we rarely see contradictory impulses or visceral emotion under pressure. The lack of a genuine internal dilemma keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional. Her micro-choices mostly concern procedure, not value conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara has a clear role, backstory wound, and articulated motivation, but her interiority leans on summary and repeated labels (“kindly decisive,” “after forgiving the unforgivable”) rather than dramatized contradiction. Her shift toward embracing renewal feels more like a stated conclusion than the endpoint of visible struggle, with the hairpin’s glow functioning as a convenient catalyst. Micro-choices (tending moss, scalloping stone, climbing) are present but rarely reveal competing impulses or real cost. This produces a coherent but somewhat flat emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris and Elara are both cleanly sketched with distinct functions: the “conscience for hire” and the certainty-locked client come through in action, not just label. Aris’s insincerity vs. genuine care is intriguing but only lightly dramatized; we’re told he’s detached more than we feel that detachment under pressure. Elara’s shift from rigid certainty to embracing nuance is motivated and plausible, though built almost entirely within this single scene. The emotional embodiment leans abstract (“vulnerability,” “awareness of possibilities”) rather than fully physicalized, which slightly blunts the change’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara and Kael are cleanly sketched with clear roles and desires, and Kael’s fear during dissolution gives a tangible emotional beat, but neither character feels deeply individuated beyond their archetypal functions (sage teacher / earnest student). Internal contradiction is minimal—Kael’s fear flickers and then resolves without extended struggle, and Elara’s withholding never costs her anything on the page. The final understanding feels earned within the story’s logic but leans more conceptual than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s primary motivation—“to learn to navigate without moving”—is clear and consistent, and her reverence for history slightly individualizes her. However, interiority remains generalized and mostly paraphrased (we’re told of her patience and reverence rather than feeling contradictions or embodied tension). There’s little sense of competing impulses or real doubt; she performs a ritual and it works. The final change into harmony is declared more than earned through observable struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian’s core motivation—seeking “the sacred in the simple” away from automation—is clear and consistent, and his choice to use the keystone to deepen his mist walking follows from that. However, his “underachieving” status and any real internal contradiction (comfort in obscurity vs desire for meaning, for instance) are mostly stated rather than dramatized. The shift from underachiever to teacher-beacon feels thematically apt but emotionally easy, with little on-page resistance or messy ambivalence. His reactions to discoveries (the keystone, the flower, the transformation) are more declarative realizations than embodied, pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s core motive (discovering the color of sound) is clear and consistently drives his actions, and his lamplighter role is cleanly integrated. However, his interiority remains relatively generalized—he feels “haunted by a singular motivation” but we rarely see embodied doubt, fear, or contradictory impulses in the moment. The revelation and his final vow arrive smoothly, without a tangible internal struggle or cost on the page. This keeps the arc sympathetic but shallow for a top-tier literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to “wavelength align with purpose” and serve as an anchor—but her interiority stays abstract and largely unembodied. We don’t see much contradictory impulse under pressure; doubt is mentioned but never dramatized as a live, destabilizing force. Her final stance (embracing the role of preserver) is plausible but feels more declared than earned through concrete micro-choices and felt cost. The result is coherent but thinner and more generic than this premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reaper’s grief, duty, and longing are clear and consistent, and his choice to perform this ritual to name his fears feels well motivated. His inner life is textured—haunted by “the echo of her sacrifice”—and his final shift to quiet acceptance is earned. However, internal contradiction is muted: he moves from sorrow to acceptance along a relatively smooth, articulated path without much on-page impulsiveness or self-sabotage. A bit more friction between wanting to hold on to pain and wanting release would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation and self-concept (lukewarm power, brittle devotion, earnest naivety) are clear and consistent, and his small embodied moments—the cut finger, fatigue, remembered criticisms—give him some texture. However, internal conflict remains largely conceptual (“brittle devotion,” “doubting whispers”) rather than dramatized as live, contradictory impulses in specific beats. His final success comes without a hard, character-testing decision, so change feels more like validation than earned transformation. This is solid but not yet at the depth or ambiguity expected for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to transform resurfacing grief into shared meaning—is clear and consistent, and his professional role grounds his actions. However, his interiority leans abstract (“This was the pain he needed to expunge”) rather than embodied and character-specific, which blunts the emotional impact. The boyhood guilt is asserted more than dramatized in a way that would create real on-page conflict. His final satisfaction arrives a bit too smoothly, with little sense of ongoing contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation and interior contradiction (logic vs. intuition, stern exterior vs. sentimental heart) are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices with the flame and crystal arise credibly from that tension. However, her success comes very smoothly once she decides, with little sense of genuine risk or potential failure. The sentimental trait shows in specific memories and embodied ache, not just labels, which strengthens her individuality. The final integration of logic and intuition is believable but feels low-cost and somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve the trust of the oblivious world below—is clear and consistent, and her competence under pressure feels grounded in the setting. However, she’s rendered almost purely as dutiful and resourceful, with little contradictory impulse or moral ambiguity to complicate her choices. Emotional states are often summarized (“burden felt heavier than ever,” “anchor… when anxiety threatened”) rather than deeply embodied. The final stance shift toward pride is plausible but comes with minimal visible cost or inner conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael’s motivation (defeating numbness after ego death) is clear and consistent, and his link to the brain-as-duplicate gives him a strong conceptual arc. However, his interiority is stated more than embodied (“felt nothing,” “desperately needed to breach”) and his big choice to merge arrives with little on-page hesitation or contradiction. We rarely see numbness conflict with an active, irrational impulse in the moment. The resulting change at the end feels earned in premise but under-struggled in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motive—to protect her creative space from corporatization—is clear and consistently linked to her identity as an escape room designer. However, her interiority leans toward abstract reflection and purpose statements rather than embodied, character-specific contradiction under pressure. She never really wavers or reveals a meaningful blind spot; the path from curiosity to inspiration is smooth. The final choice to treat the seed as opportunity rather than threat comes too easily to feel fully earned or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Conductor’s core motive—restoring laughter to a grieving household through a sacred duty—is clear, consistent, and drives all his actions. His paradoxical state (“mournfully eager”) is thematically strong and partially dramatized (“he knew the cost of this restoration”). However, his interiority remains fairly abstract and mythic, with limited concrete, character-particular detail or embodied contradiction beyond the duty/price tension. The final renunciation (fading back into shadows) is earned but emotionally could cut deeper with more specific personal stakes or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The guardian’s core drives—dimensionally homesick yet determined “to make friends with uncertainty”—are clear and internally consistent, and the final choice to step into the “between” is well-motivated. However, its emotional life is rendered largely in abstract terms rather than embodied sensations or concrete behaviors. The tension between returning to the warm library and embracing the frozen garden’s uncertainty is present but under-dramatized moment-to-moment. This keeps the arc from fully achieving the depth expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation (defying the prophecy) is clear and persistent, and his hesitation at the brink of destroying the crozier gives him a credible internal conflict. The “stoically sensitive” trait is mostly told but partially dramatized through his quiet endurance and rare smile at the end. His decisive choice to embrace destruction feels earned by the prior “dozens of times” of failure, even if those are summarized rather than fully dramatized. Emotional texture could deepen with more embodied, less abstract feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are clear and specific, and her final reframing of endings/beginnings is internally consistent with what we’ve been told. However, her emotional life is largely summarized in conceptual language rather than embodied, and the insight arrives with little visible struggle or contradiction on the page. There’s no real sense of competing impulses—only a clean, tidy arc from problem to realization. The change reads thoughtful but low-cost, which limits depth of characterization at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s core motivation (restore the Sea-Sprite / merge timelines) is clear and consistent, and his “resiliently positive” quality is dramatized through persistence rather than only labeled. However, he lacks real internal contradiction: there’s little fear, doubt, or selfish impulse to complicate his drive, and his emotional experience stays mostly at a steady, determined register. The final success feels more like competent execution of a puzzle than a pressured, costly character choice, which flattens his arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (“to discover the texture of connection”) is clear and consistently carried, and her calm persistence during the eruption gives her a recognizable through-line. However, her emotional life is mostly summarized (“a knot of unease,” “profound sense of peace”) rather than embodied in distinct, character-specific reactions. Internal contradiction is gestured at (unease vs. calm acceptance) but not really dramatized in moments of choice. The final realization that she is the connection is more conceptual than felt, so the change lands as an idea rather than an earned, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her profession is well-integrated into how she perceives and acts. Her balanced curiosity and quiet determination shape her choices, especially in how she adjusts her lesson and uses the chain link. However, her internal conflict remains mild—there’s little sense of real struggle or contradiction, and the final realization feels earned but somewhat tidy. Kael functions mostly as a foil/student rather than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motive—to protect vulnerable voices—is clear and consistent, and her occupational identity feels specific. However, she faces almost no real internal conflict; her curiosity and compassion are never in tension with fear, doubt, or frustration. Eleanor reads mostly as a vessel for her backstory rather than as a fully individuated presence beyond her grief. The final endurance—Elara bearing the loneliness of her task—is suggested but not deeply dramatized as a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to honor the unremembered researchers—is clear and consistent, and her claustrophobia is concretely embodied (squeezing into the tunnel, the helmet confines). Internal conflict between fear and duty is present but handled in a relatively straightforward way, with few truly fraught micro-choices under pressure. Her final emotional state (“her fear a little lighter, her purpose clear”) feels somewhat tidy, without a sharply felt cost for that shift. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the level of deep, idiosyncratic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (“to fetch wisdom from failure”) is clear and consistently dramatized through her ritual with the ink and her engagement with Kael’s ghost. The heartbeat-counting and the porcelain shard give her interior life concrete, embodied anchors under pressure. Internal conflict—between guilt, self-justification, and the desire for peace—is present but resolves a bit smoothly, with few moments of truly contradictory impulse. Kael’s digital ghost functions more as a gentle guide than as a crucible, so relational pressure is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to salvage a dying language by translating texture into sound—is clear and consistently dramatized, and her practiced patience and quiet articulation feel character-specific. Her fear and dread are present but could be more sharply dramatized as simultaneous, contradictory impulses at the climax. The shift from fighting the curse to harmonizing with it is motivated by the starlings and her vocation, so the final stance feels earned. More embodied, moment-to-moment emotional texture under peak pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aris’s core motivation (turning bitterness into a cosmic joke) is clear and coherently linked to his actions, and the detail of him as a cryptid researcher with an arrowhead gives him some specificity. However, his internal conflict remains largely notional—there’s little on-page struggle or hesitation as he executes his plan, so the change feels more like a procedure than a costly choice. Elara’s “frostbitten hope” is an evocative phrase, but she functions mostly as a witness and validator rather than an active source of pressure. The final realization that his work is done lands, but it doesn’t seem to cost him anything concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her inner life remains mostly declarative—she “felt despair,” then “drew courage,” without textured, contradictory impulses under pressure. Her victory comes with little visible struggle or moral trade-off; once she recalls the legend, the path is linear. The locust shell offers a hint of specificity to her psychology, yet its effect is told rather than dramatized in how her behavior changes. Overall she reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully inhabited individual.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elian’s role and core motivation are clear and consistent, and his “respectfully rebellious” stance is well articulated. However, his emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses in action—he is almost uniformly calm, principled, and resolved. The risk he takes never pushes him into visible inner conflict on the page, so his final sense of “glimmer of progress” feels gently affirmed rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—his choice to restore the carousel and later to sing both arise naturally from his established nature as a quiet craftsman. However, his inner life lacks real contradiction or friction; he moves from discovery to work to song without any moment of genuine hesitation or ambivalence. The change at the end (using his voice) feels earned but comes at little visible cost. A slightly sharper sense of what it risks or costs him to sing here would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her profession and habits feel specific rather than generic. However, she encounters little resistance and faces no real dilemma; the loss of the scarf reads as a gift, not a cost. Interiority is vivid but skewed toward lyrical summary over moment-to-moment contradiction or struggle. As a result, her final sense of peace feels earned conceptually more than emotionally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s central motive and vocation are clear and consistent, and her choices in the scene align cleanly with her pursuit of the dream. The grief realization (the dream as her mother) feels emotionally apt but is expressed in somewhat generic shorthand rather than deeply embodied, character-specific interiority. There’s little sense of real internal contradiction—she never wavers between mutually compelling impulses—so the final peace comes off as tidy rather than hard-won. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet at a truly cutting literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to free an idea trapped by fear—but he remains largely an archetypal figure (“enigmatic locksmith”) with limited concrete, differentiated interiority. His emotional life is summarized in phrases like “improbable longing” rather than dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses in the moment of risk. The one embodied cost—enduring disorientation—registers but doesn’t expose much nuance or flaw. As a result, we understand what he’s for more than who he is under genuine strain.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and motive are clear and consistent, and her folklorist background meaningfully colors her methods and perceptions. We feel embodied emotion in moments like touching the mushroom cap and the flood of recovered memories. However, she encounters little genuine resistance, and her internal state lacks strong contradictory impulses—there’s scant sense she might abandon or misread what she’s doing. The final “change” feels more like a smooth fulfillment of purpose than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist and Elian are sharply sketched, with her backward-walking nervousness and "combative tenderness" playing convincingly against his anger and vulnerability. His shift from defiance to insight is a bit swift but causally supported by the shard/tea ritual. Emotional texture is embodied enough (trembling hand, her spatial withdrawal) to avoid abstraction. A few lines verge on aphoristic self-awareness, slightly smoothing over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motive—preserving the color of wonder—is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a pruner gives her a defined role. However, she faces almost no resistance, and we see no real internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure. She reads as serenely competent and morally unambiguous, which flattens her arc. The final “resolution” is an affirmation of who she already was rather than a change with discernible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (grounding restless spirits) is clear and consistent, and we see a credible mix of resolve and unease (“lucid unrest”) under pressure. However, her internal conflict remains relatively mild: she is uneasy but never truly torn in a way that complicates decisions or produces mistakes. The relationship with Kael is warm but low-pressure; he observes and learns but doesn’t significantly challenge or reconfigure her choices. The final “we are all restorers” realization lands, but it feels more like an affirmation than a hard-won shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and professional lens (“perceptive map framer,” “methodically curious,” wanting to interpret silence with empathy) are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the external action. However, her inner life leans on repeated labels rather than specific, embodied contradiction under pressure; there’s little sense of real risk or competing impulses beyond a generalized “shielded openness.” Her success comes too smoothly—no mistake, misreading, or moral cost complicates her competence. The final softening between known/unknown feels earned enough but emotionally low-stakes for elite literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and professional competence are clear, and her shift from clinging to the dead to vowing to release them is coherent and earned enough for this length. However, most of her inner conflict is told in abstract terms (“had clung to the dead,” “quietly analytic nature”) rather than dramatized through specific, pressured micro-choices. The decision to “release the ghosts she carried” lands a bit tidy because we don’t see her actually resisting or failing at letting go on the page. Strong backbone, but the emotional struggle is smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core desire—to articulate unspoken needs—is clear and consistently aligned with her actions, and the sensory interiority around her silence and yearning feels specific. However, she faces little real resistance, and we see almost no contradictory impulses or genuine risk in her choice to use the graffiti/ghost method. The final “change” (now she has found her voice) is asserted more than earned by difficult micro-choices. As a result, the character reads evocative but somewhat flat under the level of pressure a top-tier venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation (“to seek out the joy beneath anguish”) is clear and coherently expressed through her attention to the diary, but she faces almost no genuine pressure or competing impulses. Her interiority is more generalized than particular—she reads as gentle and curious, but not deeply idiosyncratic. The final realization tracks with her prior reflections but feels like a clean uplift rather than a choice with visible cost. The absence of internal contradiction undercuts the depth of characterization expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation and a coherent interior lens on the world, with aviation detail lightly implied through his comfort in the sky. However, his emotional life is largely one-note—purposeful, reverent, quietly intense—without much contradiction or genuine struggle on the page. The “quietly explosive tension” is told more than dramatized in micro-choices or missteps. His closing contentment (“content that he had proven…”) feels too frictionless given the cosmic scale of his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation—to imprison a fragment of the sky as defiance—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her sensory and perceptual bias (face blindness, reliance on touch and scent) gives her interiority a distinctive texture. However, we see relatively little contradictory impulse under peak pressure; she moves from determination to acceptance with minimal on-page emotional friction. A bit more embodied conflict around “finishing the work at any cost” versus recognizing its futility would deepen her final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s curiosity, diligence, and sense of standing slightly apart from the crew are clear and consistent, and her actions (observing, decoding, reporting) align with those traits. However, her interiority stays relatively flat—there’s little real ambivalence, fear of being wrong, or conflicting impulse to deepen her as more than an exemplary apprentice. Embodied emotion is light; we’re told her heart races, but we don’t feel much bodily or irrational texture under pressure. The relationship with the captain is sketched, not really used as a crucible for change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation—to learn the “rhythm of repair”—is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her competence as a locksmith/time-seeker feels coherent. However, she faces almost no meaningful resistance or internal contradiction; there’s little sense of fear, doubt, or competing values under pressure. Emotional states tend to be labeled lyrically (“driftwood nostalgia,” “wistful ache”) rather than dramatized through conflicted impulses. The final shift toward acceptance is pleasant but lightly earned, with minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivations are clear and consistent—survival, guidance, and earned trust—but interiority stays relatively surface-level and the characters read more as well-drawn roles (leader, skeptic, botanist, benevolent ghost) than fully particular individuals. Elara’s renewed decision to trust the ghost at the “Trust the resonance” message is credible, yet we don’t feel much contradictory impulse or real risk in that choice. The family dynamic is sketched convincingly but never truly stressed to a breaking point. The ghost’s altruism is persuasive but also somewhat one-note, with little moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and her final choice to give “everything she had” feels earned, but she remains more archetype than fully individuated person. Interiority leans on elevated abstraction (“bruised awe,” “sacred offering”) rather than specific, embodied contradictions under pressure. Her flaws are mostly asserted (“beautifully flawed,” regrets and failures) without being dramatized in concrete missteps or conflicted impulses in scene. The emotional arc tracks, but without the nuance or specificity expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—reluctant duty versus genuine care—and her shift to “quiet acceptance” is earned by the on-page rescue. Interiority is specific enough (resenting the orchard while still acting decisively), though her inner conflict could be more sharply dramatized in the highest-pressure beats. Emotions mostly show through concrete action (building the device, dodging birds) rather than labels. The final stance—she will do it again despite the binding curse—lands as credible earned stasis with some felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s grief, guilt, and need for atonement are tangible and specific, with his professional lens (polymer chemistry) nicely fused to his interiority. His shift from self-punishment to purposeful continuation of Elena’s work feels motivated and emotionally plausible. However, his internal conflict is relatively smooth—there’s limited on-page resistance or contradiction at the moment of insight, so the change edges toward “clean epiphany” rather than messy human struggle. More friction or self-sabotage at the turning point would bring this closer to top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motivation (“to find the place where stories begin”) is clear and consistently pursued, and her shift from erasure-vendor to guide is legible and earned. However, her interiority leans abstract (“integrated fragmentation,” “quantifying absence”) rather than embodied, so we rarely feel contradictory impulses in a visceral way. The discovery and return are too smooth—she never seriously doubts or falters—so the cost of her change is conceptual more than dramatized. This keeps her from reading as fully human at a level suitable for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kaelen’s core motivation (to transform others’ remorse at personal cost) is clear, consistent, and tied to specific actions. His interiority is concrete enough—tasting memories as flavors, feeling waves of borrowed sorrow—but rarely shows real contradiction or destabilizing doubt under pressure. The “emotionally contagious” risk is noted but doesn’t quite force him into a painful dilemma or visible misstep. The final stance (integration, not erasure) feels earned but emotionally safe given the magnitude of what he’s taking on.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her role as choral librarian, mediator, and repairer of the clock gives her a coherent, particular identity. However, her interiority remains relatively unconflicted—she feels the “weight” of her mission but never wavers or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure. The three representatives function more as allegorical stand-ins for their silos than as characters with distinct emotional stakes. The final harmony feels emotionally plausible but somewhat low-cost because no one is forced to choose against a deep personal fear or bias on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to become an “archeologist of abandoned dreams” and uses the mirror to access and alter entangled memories. The helix-minded/engineer framing gives her some specificity, and her actions align with that identity. However, her emotional life is described more in conceptual than embodied terms, and there’s little real internal contradiction or irrationality under pressure. Her final “transformation” feels more declared than wrestled with, softening the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her “prism-minded” way of seeing gives her a mildly distinctive interior filter. However, her emotional life is abstracted; we get little embodied fear, doubt, or sensory overwhelm even when she confronts the threshold effects that previously broke her. The final transformation into “guardian” feels thematically apt but under-costed, with little sense of what she’s giving up or how it complicates her humanity. Internal contradiction (courage vs. dread, curiosity vs. self-preservation) is asserted in backstory but not really dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her vocation gives her a distinct inner life. However, she experiences almost no visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses once the insulator is found. Her success comes without hesitation or doubt, so the ending feels more like fulfillment of destiny than a hard-won choice. The character is strong for a lyric piece, but not yet operating under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s exile, history as a chess tutor, and reflective, methodical temperament are clearly rendered and consistent with his actions at the nexus. His motivation to mend the covenant and “discover beauty in the difficult” reads specific rather than generic. However, internal conflict is relatively muted—he rarely feels genuinely torn or irrational under pressure, which softens the sense of cost. The closing acceptance of a hard path toward hope feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motive—to recover the diary and pursue empathy through cataloging silence—is clear and consistent, and her emotions surface in specific reactions (trembling hands, surge of hope). However, she rarely experiences genuine internal contradiction under pressure; there’s little sense of competing impulses or moral risk. The final realization about empathy is more told than organically struggled toward on the page. As a result, the change at the end feels modest and somewhat pre-declared rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s ambition, sensitivity, and frustration are clearly established, and her micro-choices (journaling, rising to inspect the seed, reframing her drawings) track cleanly with those traits. The internal conflict between ambition and serenity is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized through difficult, costly choices. Her epiphany and shift toward patience are motivated yet arrive a bit neatly, with limited sense of real sacrifice or lingering contradiction. Still, she feels specific and non-generic, particularly through her olfactory focus and family journaling custom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaelen’s professional motive and competence (“intrepid orchard pilot” seeking the source of resilience) are clear and consistent, and his choices do steer the story. However, his inner life is thin: there’s little contradiction, fear, or doubt, and he encounters no serious moral or emotional friction. The realization about resilience feels more like an informational upgrade than a pressured internal shift. This keeps the characterization effective but not yet deep or distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is competently drawn as a meticulous, ethically driven investigator, and his professional mindset feels plausible. However, his inner life leans abstract (“cultivate foresight in action,” “singular convergence”) rather than character-particular, and we rarely see genuinely contradictory impulses under pressure. His emotional response to Kael’s patch is a strong moment, but the story doesn’t deepen that into a sharper internal conflict or costly choice. The ending registers as a clarified mission more than a complex, hard-earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s central desire is clear and consistent, but she remains more emblematic than fully human, with little contradiction or textured interiority. Her emotions are largely labeled (“surge of joy,” “vivid confirmation of her life’s purpose”) rather than dramatized through specific, embodied reactions. There is no real internal conflict or cost to her commitment; she wants wonder, pursues wonder, and simply achieves it. This limits the sense of a transformative arc even though she occupies the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is sharply defined—atonement and understanding after failure—and his actions (marking the world with driftwood, choosing to relive the citadel’s fall) clearly arise from that drive. His internal state is convincingly somber and focused, though often described in fairly abstract terms rather than through idiosyncratic, embodied detail. The arc from shame-haunted relic keeper to someone “remade” by failure is legible and earned by the journey. What’s missing at a top-tier level is more contradiction and specificity in his inner life—he reads more as a well-executed archetype than a singular person.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—an obsessive drive to “understand the mathematics of emotion”—and her actions track well with that aim. The interiority is vivid and embodied, especially when multiple borrowed emotions collide. However, her contradictions and blind spots as a person (beyond the experiment) stay somewhat schematic, so the final acceptance costs her in concept more than in a deeply personalized, felt way. The closure choice—reclaiming a stable self and shelving the fragment—reads earned but could land harder with a more individuated sense of who she is outside the project.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s jitteriness, reliance on the pendant, and shift toward calm determination are clear and consistent, but his inner conflict is relatively simple—he wants wonder and then, after being told how to see it, he decides to do so. The traveler is more function than character, serving as a wise explicator with little texture or pressure. The emotional beats (loneliness, awe, resolve) land, yet they rarely show competing impulses in the same moment. The closing vow feels earned but low-cost, with limited sense of what he’s actually giving up or resisting.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and process are clear and consistent, and the turn when she sees her own guilt in the prism is logically grounded in what we know of her. However, the internal conflict is mostly summarized—her guilt and supposed “purity” are asserted rather than deeply dramatized in embodied, contradictory impulses. Moments like “Her assumptions about her own purity shattered” feel like diagnostic shorthand instead of lived-through crisis. The final stance of humility is credible but reached with relatively little on-page struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive—sending a message to Liam—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it through to the final sacrifice. However, her interiority is generalized and largely summary-based, with few concrete, character-specific contradictions under pressure. The crucial sacrifice choice feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, so internal conflict is more implied than dramatized. Liam registers mainly as an absence and a receiver, not a fully pressurized relationship on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—meek, deliberate, quietly determined—and his choices (venturing into mines, bartering the silk, sharing knowledge) align with this. However, interiority is thin and strongly summarized; we are told his determination and “azure defiance” rather than seeing much embodied conflict or contradiction under pressure. The “awakening” largely happens in declarative summary (“had transformed his very being”) with little dramatized cost or struggle. As a result, the arc feels credible but emotionally underdeveloped for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaelen’s core motivation and emotional throughline are clear and consistent, and his profession links nicely to his inner life. However, his interiority leans abstract (“the weight of a withheld truth”) and largely lacks in-scene contradictory impulses under pressure. We rarely see him hesitate, doubt, or choose between competing values once the shard appears, which flattens his arc. The final acceptance of the truth lands, but it feels more asserted than struggled for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motives (reticence, kinship with Cora, desire to “bottle” safety) are clear and consistently expressed through concrete choices, especially building the guiding cairn and relighting the lamp. His interiority is particular—sea-focused, tactile—and avoids stock emotion labels. However, internal contradiction is muted: he adapts quickly from fear to solution, with little on-page struggle between competing impulses. The final quiet peace feels earned but relatively low-cost emotionally, keeping this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s motive—to “shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is clear and consistent, and the storm-keeping task suits him, but he rarely faces real friction or a conflicted choice. Interiority stays mostly at the level of declared purpose and mood (“shadowed elation”) rather than concrete, character-specific contradictions. His “accidentally prophetic” nature doesn’t change his behavior or force a costed decision. As a result, he feels more like an emblematic figure than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation (to understand story-magnetism, possibly inherited through his donor heart) is clear and consistently pursued. His craft background and “watchful” nature color how he approaches the wing and light, giving him a distinct interior lens. However, his “quietly explosive” trait remains mostly asserted rather than dramatized, with little in-scene contradiction or real struggle. The final shift—accepting himself as part of the story-web—feels earned but emotionally low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motives (understanding trees, deconstructing quantified sorrow) are clear and consistent, and her small, concrete actions with the sextant and dream maps track those motives. However, her interiority leans abstract and generalized (“quantified sorrow,” “silent corridors of her heart”) with limited embodied emotion or contradiction under pressure. Her transformation from burdened to light feels somewhat unopposed and frictionless, with little sense of real risk or potential failure on the page. The result is a coherent but not yet deeply individualized or hard-won characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—rekindling the realm by weaving dawns—is clear and consistent, and her ritual before the mica window gives her a lived routine under pressure. However, she lacks much contradictory impulse or real hesitation; once “the realm was at its brink,” she simply does what she ought to do. Her scattered memory is more premise than dramatized obstacle, as we rarely see it actively sabotaging choices on the page. The final consolidation of her memories feels emotionally right but not deeply earned by prior internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core traits (compassionate, reclusive, guilt-ridden) and motivation to learn from her mistake are clear and consistent, and the “nestled paradoxes” of her nature are thematically apt. However, her emotional life is heavily told rather than shown, with little concrete embodiment beyond anxiety and guilt. The shift from isolation to renewed purpose happens smoothly, with minimal on-page struggle or visible cost. Her interaction with the elder hints at deeper conflict but resolves too quickly to feel fully earned at a top-tier literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and consistent, and her habits of attention feel character-particular (“noticer of creeping normalities”). Her actions—tending plants, preserving the bread, persisting with the fountain—align cleanly with those motives. However, the piece largely sidesteps on-page contradictory impulses or visible moral messiness; her shame and fear are articulated more as theme than as live, conflicting drives. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost, more realization than hard-fought change.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—his reverence, meticulousness, and archivist’s purpose are well established and followed through to the end. However, he experiences almost no contradictory impulses; his ache and duty never come into real tension on the page. Emotional reactions are often summarized (“Elian’s heart ached, but he focused on his task”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final endurance—accepting loss while preserving records—lands, but with relatively low felt cost because we haven’t seen him genuinely tempted to do otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to thwart Silas and capture the sound of trust breaking—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her tactics, and her embodied fear (heart pounding, spine prickling) keeps the interiority grounded. However, she’s almost entirely steadfast and competent, with little on-page contradiction or genuine moral friction between her aesthetic goal (recording betrayal) and the risk to her family. Her choice not to confront Silas is interesting but not deeply contested inside her; she never seriously considers an alternative. Secondary characters (Silas, the agent) function mainly as forces, not personalities, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—skeptical, luminous, driven to understand weather-carriers—is clear and consistent, and her use of the compass and tasting the air shows purposeful micro-choices. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped: her skepticism “wavers” and then essentially vanishes with little resistance once the man explains things. The man himself functions more as an articulate exposition node than a pressured character, so the relationship never really becomes a crucible. The ending shift (accepting she now carries calm weather) lands, but the cost of that shift is only lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific—humiliation at the gallery and the ache of blocked creativity credibly drive her into the cave. The mnemonic gift as a “curse” usefully sharpens her pain, though it’s more told than dramatized. Internal contradiction (shame vs. compulsion to keep making art) is present but not deeply tested in scene; once she’s in the cave, her path is relatively untroubled. The final shift—leaving the lock and accepting the enduring “sorrow” of creation—feels earned but somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s core motivation (finding where lost conversations go) is clear and consistent, and her craft as a gilded-leaf calligrapher gives her some individuality. However, she moves through the story with relatively little internal contradiction or hard trade-offs; the quest mostly confirms what she already values rather than forcing a fraught choice. Emotional states are more declared than embodied, and we rarely see her behave in ways that reveal blind spots or genuine flaw. The final shift in purpose feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation—to preserve the “color of wonder”—is clear and consistent, and her craft as a bell tuner is well-embedded in her choices. However, her interiority remains relatively one-note: we see dedication and muted satisfaction, but not much contradiction, doubt, or ethically fraught impulse under pressure. The seasonal muteness and its emotional cost are asserted rather than dramatized in a moment of real need. As a result, the closing sense of “understanding” feels more like thematic declaration than a hard-won internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s core motivation (resolving the inner static) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and the android caretaker role adds texture. However, his interiority leans on conceptual language (“static,” “fragmented wholeness”) rather than concrete, character-particular embodiment under pressure. The conflict between his nostalgia for the farm and his need to leave is gestured at but never fully dramatized in the moment of burning. The final sense of calm feels earned enough, but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (“to prove that listening heals”) is clear and her actions align with it, and Mr. Hemlock’s grief is legible, but both are rendered in broad, familiar strokes. We rarely see Elara’s interior conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure; she moves from decision to success with little friction. Mr. Hemlock’s shift from years of avoidance to immediate agreement to open the mailbox feels somewhat easy, softening the emotional cost. The relationship between them is touching but not deeply particularized or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (liberate the truth, turn vulnerability into strength) is clear and consistent, and her code-breaking/dance fusion gives her some individuality. However, her emotional life is largely declared rather than dramatized; we’re told about “calm defiance” and a “vow” more than we feel conflicting impulses in moment-to-moment choices. The work proceeds too smoothly for her competence and fear to really collide on the page. Her final inner shift toward peace tracks with earlier statements but lacks a tangible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, particular, and sustained: the need to recover deliberately erased memories, grounded in the small, vivid detail of the pressed wildflowers. Her actions (consulting coffee grounds, choosing to dig, reading the letters, making peace) align with that drive and show a credible inner life. However, the internal contradiction—her past choice to forget versus her present need to remember—is mostly summarized via the letters rather than dramatized in-scene, so her emotional struggle at the decisive moment feels somewhat smoothed over. A bit more on-page ambivalence or resistance when the memories return would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to hush the prophecy—but his interior life remains thin and almost entirely unconflicted. Emotion is stated in abstractions (“profound relief,” “tranquil blaze”) rather than embodied specifics, so he never feels like a fully particular person. He encounters no meaningful internal struggle or competing impulse as the ritual progresses, which flattens his arc. The “cost” of success is not dramatized, so his final relief reads more like a label than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dynamic between the narrator and Finch is clear, specific, and affecting, with the “agreed upon lies” nicely crystallizing their relationship. The narrator’s motivation (to learn the language of buildings) is vivid but remains largely untested—there’s little contradiction or real cost to her desire. Finch’s ghostliness provides pathos and some implied regret, but he tends to function as a flawless, patient mentor rather than a fully conflicted person. The handoff of the seal is emotionally credible, yet the narrator’s internal struggle at that loss is underplayed given the weight of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation—freeing herself from a sealed trauma—is clear and consistent from the outset, and her actions in the Circle of Echoes align with it. However, her interiority leans on summary (“translate her isolation into independence”) rather than concrete, character-specific contradiction under pressure. We rarely see simultaneous opposing impulses (terror vs desire to change) dramatized in the moment; she moves through the ritual with little visible struggle. The change at the end is credible but feels somewhat smoothed and idealized, with limited felt cost on the page beyond the summarized memory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—escaping the guilt of her “calibrated treason”—is clear and consistently drives her actions, from entering the sanctuary to using the thorn. Her interiority is specific enough (the trembling hands, the remembered stories from her grandmother) to feel individual rather than generic. However, her internal conflict is relatively one-directional—remorse to release—with little felt contradiction or risk that she might choose otherwise, which flattens the peak decision slightly. The endurance of guilt over years is told more than dramatized, so the final shift, while credible, is not as psychologically complex as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kaelen’s core motivation is clear and consistent, but he remains more an allegorical figure than a fully realized person, with little in the way of contradictory impulses or specific, embodied emotion. His “richly perceptive” nature is mostly stated rather than dramatized through textured interiority. The final change—learning why some people echo and becoming an echo himself—lands conceptually but feels emotionally under-earned because we haven’t seen him struggle or risk much on the page. As a result, the arc reads plausible but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to “salvage something pure from the wreckage”—is clear and consistently drives his choices, but it remains mostly at the level of stated purpose rather than embodied inner conflict. We do not see contradictory impulses or moment-to-moment doubt as he invades strangers’ dreams or decides how much truth to give Anya. His emotional experience is summarized (“Kaelen felt the restless energy of Elias’s spirit finally calm”) instead of dramatized through sensory, character-specific perception. The result is a competent but not yet deep or conflicted characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to appreciate hidden effort and integrate that insight into his net-mending—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (going to the parapet, performing the tea ritual, then returning to work) align with it. However, he rarely experiences genuine internal contradiction or pressure; his “demure audacity” never meaningfully conflicts with anything at stake. Emotional states are more declared than layered, and his serenity is almost never troubled. The final shift toward “renewed purpose” feels credible but relatively costless.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation as a conspiracy debunker in search of the “truth beneath comfortable lies” is clear and consistently drives his actions. His observational nature is shown through specific details (geometry of branches, growth rings), not just told. However, his internal conflict at the end (share vs conceal) is more stated than dramatized; we don’t feel a real tug-of-war between competing impulses on the page. The final “choice” is held as a poised dilemma rather than a fully embodied struggle, which slightly limits the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is vividly drawn—her solitude, radio-obsession, and prophetic bent give her a distinctive psychology, and her decision to leave the observatory feels motivated by accumulated years of listening. However, once she descends, her internal conflict largely disappears; we’re told her loyalties waver, but we don’t feel a sustained, scene-level push-pull between withdrawal and engagement. The prophet and factions remain thin, so relationships don’t quite become crucibles under pressure. The final “not quite belonging” note is earned but could land harder with more dramatized contradiction earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s motivation (atonement via preserving sounds) is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his jar-work and tenderness toward the music box. Backstory as a fallen bard with hubris adds texture and plausible guilt. However, internal conflict remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in real-time choices; we’re told his hands tremble from “the weight of his quest” but not forced to watch him confront a concrete, conflicting impulse. The closing shift to contentment is earned but a bit tidy and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and his technical focus meshes well with his guardianship of the key. However, his interiority leans on labels (“logically emotional”) rather than dramatized contradiction, so we rarely feel competing impulses under pressure. His emotional journey from tension to reaffirmed purpose is linear and largely untroubled, with minimal visible cost or genuine doubt. Actions align with his stated goals, but they reveal competence more than complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (“to sculpt patience from the impatience that had once ruled her”) is clear and consistent, and her calm, ritualized actions align with it. However, her internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized; we’re told her impatience is an “old, sharp thing” but never see it meaningfully intrude on or complicate the ritual. The shift at the end toward “calm triumph” feels earned enough but carries little visible cost or contradiction. Overall she’s distinct but somewhat idealized and frictionless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation, history, and internal conflict between obedience and integrity are clear and consistent, and her final refusal to hand over the ledger is credibly earned. The link to her ancestral lineage gives her psychology dimension beyond the immediate case. However, her inner life is sometimes rendered in abstract labels (“fortified vulnerability,” “stifled yearnings for autonomy”) rather than concrete, idiosyncratic thought, and Thorn remains a flat embodiment of “controlling authority” rather than a fully realized person. The emotional cost of her choice is implied more than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The chaplain’s guilt-driven motivation and need for redemption are clear and consistent, and his choice to learn the repair himself is well-motivated by prior regret over Elias. Interiority is concrete and filtered through his vocation, but his inner life leans a bit clean and sermon-like, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The woman functions mostly as a calm, capable facilitator rather than a source of active interpersonal friction. The closing sense of earned peace is plausible, though the cost paid feels more contemplative than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s core drive—to “ring a bell no one hears yet” and answer the algorithm’s yearning—is clear and consistent, and her irreverent awe gives her a distinct flavor. However, she rarely faces genuine internal friction or contradictory impulses; she simply proceeds toward her goal without visible doubt or cost. Emotions tend to be summarized rather than embodied, so we don’t feel stress or degradation under pressure. The final “change” in her is more stated (she has succeeded) than earned through layered struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and specific, and her actions (opening the cold case, lying for access, preserving the data) align cleanly with it. However, interiority stays mostly at the level of articulated obsession and insight rather than moment-by-moment, embodied conflict (we don’t feel fear, guilt, or temptation in the lie, for instance). Contradictory impulses are implied (duty vs. private obsession, corporate loyalty vs. truth) but rarely dramatized in-scene. The final endurance—accepting that she will carry the “sensed absence”—is thematically apt yet emotionally under-textured for this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation (protecting the coast, mending a past failure) is clear and coherent, and his calm, intuitive nature consistently informs his choices. However, he faces almost no internal contradiction or genuine doubt; he moves from problem to solution without visible inner struggle. The line about “mapping empathy onto action” gestures toward complexity but is not dramatized as a difficult trade-off. As a result, the final choice to free the leviathan feels emotionally right but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and contradiction (euthanasia tourist who “woke changed” and now seeks meaning in disaster work) are clear and coherent, with interiority filtered through concrete acts like trawling and handling the parasol tip. However, her shift from wanting to die to embracing life is mostly asserted rather than dramatized via hard choices or visible backsliding. Emotional states are embodied in cold, wind, and ice but sometimes summarized in abstract phrases (“a fold in patience,” “windborne solace”). The final acceptance feels earned enough for this length but could use one sharper, costed moment of temptation or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    The sentinel’s interiority is consistent and we see a clear before/after in his stance toward the past, but he remains more emblematic than individuated. His big shift—“to release the old grief, to let it compost into wisdom rather than poison”—is thematically apt yet comes a bit too cleanly, without much visible resistance or contradiction. Emotion is often labeled in abstract terms (“intersubjective understanding,” “curator of his own history”) rather than grounded in idiosyncratic sensation or behavior. The absent lover is sketched conceptually and never exerts present-tense pressure, which flattens relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s core motivation—to preserve the prophet’s wisdom—is clear and consistent, and the shift from “desperate drive” to “quiet stewardship” gives him a minimal but legible arc. However, interiority remains abstract and declarative; we are told his nature is “strangely honest” and that he feels compelled, but we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The removal of the mask at the end gestures toward vulnerability, but it isn’t set up as a conflicted choice with cost. Overall he reads more like an archetypal functionary than a fully particular person.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and motivation are clear and consistent, and Mr. Hemlock is sketched with just enough specificity to feel real. However, Elara experiences little genuine internal conflict; she functions more as an instrument of the theme than as a character under pressure. Her calm is an asset but never a liability, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or a meaningful cost to her choices. The final sense of completion feels earned but relatively easy, without much dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and her scholarly obsession feels particular to her. However, her reticence and the cost of overcoming it stay largely abstract; we’re told she’s daunted, but the inner friction at the decisive moment is thinly dramatized. The final shift—finding her voice and deciding to speak—is conceptually apt but emotionally under-struggled on the page. Interiority leans on repetition (“weathered innocence,” remembered bustle) rather than deepening contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prophet’s motivation and limitation are clear and specific—his tidal longing and precognitive forgetfulness shape nearly every choice. Interiority is rendered through concrete images (chalk weight, smudged symbols) rather than labels, which gives him texture. Internal conflict is present but relatively simple: he wants to grasp what by nature must remain elusive, with little on-page contradiction beyond persistence vs inevitability. The final acceptance/forgetting reads as an earned endurance rather than a revelation, but it lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to capture the once-in-an-era solar flare—is clear, consistent, and rooted in her vocation, and her competence under pressure feels earned. However, her interiority leans more toward generalized lyricism (“luminous ache,” “beautiful, painful urgency”) than concrete, character-specific contradictions. We don’t see much genuine internal conflict or a visible flaw complicating her choices; she moves fairly serenely from problem to solution. The final endurance/acceptance beat (ache lingering after success) lands, but the cost is more conceptual than personally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivations are clear—Elara wants a “flawless goodbye,” Alistair wants peace and reconciliation—but interiority remains thin and nearly conflict-free. Elara is almost saintly, with no contradictory impulses or cost to her role, which flattens her complexity. Alistair’s regret over Lena is effective but quickly and neatly resolved, without deeper ambivalence. The relationships work functionally on the page, yet feel curated rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her curiosity about the missing shadows drives every choice, and her scholarly competence reads credibly. However, she rarely experiences genuine internal conflict or doubt; the piece lacks a moment where contradictory impulses collide in-scene. Her emotional responses to big turns (awakening an entity, partially fixing reality, the key cracking) feel under-dramatized. The final resolve “to continue her work” feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core traits—grief-stricken, formerly skeptical, fundamentally forgiving—are clear and consistent, and her decision to reinterpret the changeling as a guide rather than a thief is an earned pivot. Her interiority is specific enough (the tooth in her palm, the bone-setting memory) to feel individual rather than generic. However, her emotional progression from devastation to luminous peace is very smooth; there’s little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse fighting back against the forgiveness. The arc reads more like a graceful slide into insight than a pressured, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to share light without fire and to reconcile her solitude with a desire for connection—is clear, consistent, and organically rooted in her history with the shore and her grandmother. Interiority feels particular (the sea glass as a “pearl of stillness,” weighing memories “not in grams”), and the final decision to return to the village is credibly earned from prior reflection. The internal change from isolation-as-prison to isolation-as-perspective is legible and scaled appropriately to the scene. The main weakness is that her conflict is relatively smooth and low-friction; contradictory impulses flicker but are not deeply dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific—her blend of watchfulness and resolve tracks cleanly from the data-center sanctuary to the pendant offering. Interiority is textured, though occasionally abstracted into phrases like “protected vulnerability” that feel closer to thematic language than lived cognition. Internal conflict is relatively muted; she has largely decided on her course before the scene, so we see courage enacted more than wrestled with. Leo is thin but serviceable as a mirror and receiver of the gesture, with his line about the forest inside the stone hinting at his inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motivation and role are clear, and the link between collecting hopes and curing her creative stagnation is conceptually strong. However, her “conflicted novelist” status is mostly told rather than dramatized, with little on-page contradiction between doubt and purpose once the scene begins. Emotional reactions to the hopes (e.g., the mother’s laughter) are sketched but not deeply embodied or idiosyncratic. Her final shift to “no longer conflicted” feels neat and under-costed relative to the grand premise.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her whimsical, tinkerer identity is at least partly embodied in her pockets of gears and her adaptive singing. However, her inner life is thin: we rarely see concrete doubt, fear, or conflicting impulses under pressure, and her success comes almost frictionlessly. The “cost” is mostly implied responsibility to share the songs rather than any on-page loss or hard trade-off, which blunts depth. As a result, she feels charming but somewhat idealized and low-friction for a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and specific—an alchemist mapping heartbeats for the lost—but her interiority remains largely serene and unconflicted, with little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. The patience/cold tradeoff is sketched rather than deeply felt, and her emotional arc moves in a straight line from purpose to completion. Actions align with motives, but we rarely see irrationality, doubt, or moral friction. As a result she feels more like an emblematic figure than a fully inhabited, idiosyncratic person.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—curious, methodical, wanting to “store wonder in the cellar of reason.” However, he experiences almost no internal conflict; his desires are never meaningfully at odds with each other or with his environment. Emotional beats lean on summary (“felt a profound satisfaction”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final stance (certainty that wonder can be saved) is earned but comes at no visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—turning emotional burdens into tangible weights—and her internal shift from feeling “boundary-lessly trapped” to expanded by her task gives her a modest but real arc. However, her emotional life is mostly reported rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment, so pressure never bites deeply. She rarely struggles or fails with a burden; each transforms after a brief cue, which flattens internal conflict. The final change feels earned enough but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The widow’s motivation—using carving as a practical way to metabolize grief—is clear and consistent, and her occupationally specific memories of the lion tamer give her some individuality. However, her inner life leans on generalized grief language (“her heart ached,” “harvest lessons from loss”) rather than sharply particularized thought. The practical/grieving contradiction is gestured at but never forces a truly fraught choice; she simply proceeds to carve. The final lightening of her heart is believable but emotionally modest for the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and history are clear and specific—her regret-diminished ambitions and need to “negotiate” with her ghost feel coherent and character-driven. Her interiority is sometimes delivered in abstracted summary (“Her ambitions, once sharp as broken glass, were now eroded...”) rather than dramatized in scene. The final acceptance beat is emotionally credible but a bit tidy, with little contradictory impulse visible in the moment of negotiation. Still, her choices (entering the lagoon, offering the camera wheel, accepting her ghost) track cleanly with her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his choices (to stay, to repurpose, to leave the sextant) track cleanly with that setup. However, he faces almost no credible resistance, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or real strain under pressure. Emotional texture leans on labels like “stoic wonder” rather than dramatizing conflict on the page. The closing realization feels earned but low-cost, more affirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and consistent, with tangible motives—the abandoned musical ambition, the solace in clocks—driving every choice. Her gentleness and introversion feel embodied rather than labeled, especially in how she handles the tiles and gears. The final acceptance of her transformed dream is earned by prior reflection and action, though the emotional conflict is resolved a bit too cleanly and swiftly. A touch more contradiction or cost at the end (lingering regret alongside serenity) would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s goal and backstory are clear, and her realization about the bell versus betrayal is motivated by longstanding doubt and family stories. However, her emotional life is often rendered in abstract terms (“serene upheaval,” “clarity approaching”) rather than embodied, so the shift costs her little on the page. We rarely see contradictory impulses in real time—she moves fairly smoothly toward the correct conclusion. The final acceptance feels a bit tidy, with limited sense of what she’s truly risking by letting the legend go.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation and core trait (patience in service of preservation) are clear and consistent, and her actions track cleanly with them. However, she is rendered almost entirely as a serene, competent vessel, with little in the way of contradiction, doubt, or embodied emotional texture beyond stock gestures (“her heart full”). The transition from collector to guardian is thematically apt but comes without much visible psychological struggle or cost. As a result, she feels more like an archetype than a fully particular human being.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is specific and memorable (a traveler writing obituaries for the living, using a thread to project presence), with clear motivation tied to grief and healing. Her emotional life is felt, but internal contradiction is underplayed; we’re told about her own losses late rather than seeing them complicate her choices in scene. Kael exists largely as a projection, so his characterization is necessarily thinner but still coherent. The final realization about honoring absences is earned but leans a bit on exposition rather than dramatized inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation and goal are clear and consistent, and the prince’s actions track logically from his desire to reawaken beauty, but his interiority leans on repeated abstractions (“bitterly sweet,” “flawed genesis”) more than specific, idiosyncratic thought. We get little genuine contradiction in him—only resolve plus weariness—so his final shift from bedraggled to radiant feels somewhat untested. Embodied emotion appears (trembling hands, calloused palms) but not in a layered, escalating way. The ending change in him is believable yet lacks a strong sense of cost or moral complication.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and contradiction—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter-healer—are clear, specific, and consistently tied to her choices, especially in the coin handoff and her framing of the graft as redemption. Her emotional state is mostly embodied (“her heart ached,” the ache of lives she couldn’t save) rather than abstracted. The girl is thinner as a character but still registers through flinching, trust, and the final song. The internal conflict could be tested a bit more directly on the page, but what’s here feels psychologically coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and traits (“luminous skeptic,” “realistically imaginative”) are clear and consistently expressed through her methodical quest. However, her interiority leans declarative rather than sharply individuated, and we rarely see true contradiction or messy emotion under pressure. Her skepticism dissolves at the end without much dramatized struggle, so the change feels a bit preordained. The emotional cost of her choice reads as light, more vocation than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation (share light without fire, honor generational duty) is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the shift from mapping to encoding. However, her interiority remains relatively generalized—she feels unease and sorrow, but conflicting impulses (duty vs despair vs selfish desire) are sketched rather than deeply dramatized. The final choice to break the cycle is motivated and paid for emotionally, but the cost is more conceptual than personally fraught. Overall she reads coherent and specific in role, less so in psychological nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her occupation and family history give her a specific texture, but she faces almost no contradictory impulses or genuine internal struggle on the page. Her emotional state is mostly summarized (“fiercely meditative focus,” “profound peace”) rather than embodied in conflicted, character-particular reactions. The grandfather’s ghost remains more symbolic than pressuring; their relationship never really forces a difficult choice. Her final understanding feels more bestowed than wrestled for, which limits the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s guilt and sense of ethical duty are clearly established and consistent, and his professional habits feel specific enough to give him contour. However, his internal conflict resolves too smoothly: once he reconsiders the inscriptions, he slides from torment to acceptance with little on-page struggle. The key realization—“a realization of his own worth”—is told rather than dramatized and reads as an unearned epiphany. Still, his micro-choices (consulting the handle, refusing shortcuts, adjusting the bob patiently) track cleanly with his motives.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to decode the sovereign case and understand the prior gardener’s intentions—is clear and consistent, and her occupation colors her perceptions. However, her interiority remains relatively simple and unconflicted; she rarely faces contradictory impulses or genuine doubt on the page. Emotional states are often summarized rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The final “change” into carrying the torch forward is thematically apt but arrives with little sense of cost or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation and method are well articulated and consistent, and his interiority tracks clearly through hesitation, modeling, and eventual commitment. However, much of his conflict is described in abstract terms (“predictive arcs,” “constraint-breaker”) rather than grounded in embodied sensation or concrete, character-particular detail. The piece leans more on conceptual labels than on specific, idiosyncratic reactions under pressure, which blunts emotional immediacy. The final sense of fulfillment feels earned but not deeply complicated by visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, habits, and longing are clear and specific, and her shift from passive copyist to active smuggler of stories is well-motivated. However, her fear versus desire is kept mostly at the level of statement (“threat of exposure loomed large”) rather than dramatized in a concrete, pressured choice. Interiority is evocative but somewhat generalized; we rarely see a moment where she nearly pulls back or missteps. The final stance feels like a solid evolution, but the cost of that evolution is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and role as “resident ash scatterer” are vivid and consistent, and her ritualized choices (grinding the mask, drawing with the amalgam) flow logically from grief and love. The internal arc from hurt to acceptance is clear and earned, especially in “She depicted not the man he was, but the man she needed him to be.” However, contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized; we’re told of regret and forgiveness but rarely see her truly wavering. A slightly prompt-like labeling (“Her attribute was that…”) flattens nuance at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and internal contradiction (duty vs. doubt, reason vs. isolation) are clear and consistent, and her attachment to the cog and the layers gives her a specific texture. However, her feelings are often summarized in abstract terms (“agonized,” “deep-seated need”) rather than embodied in concrete reactions or mistakes under pressure. Relationships are mostly off-page; we’re told she unsettles others and risks isolation, but we don’t see a live interaction where that pressure forces a hard choice. The ending stance (quiet recommitment) is earned but feels more like a continuation than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to heal a divided community through choral harmony—is clear, consistent, and nicely linked to her past anger and gradual unlearning of hatred. Her interiority is specific and embodied in places (the tactile engagement with the library, the weight of the rosette), but most conflict is already digested into reflection rather than dramatized contradiction in the present. We’re told more about the difficulty of her journey than we see her actually struggle or falter on the page. Secondary characters (the choir) are a faceless collective, applying minimal live pressure to reveal further facets of her.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to create beauty from ruin and alchemize grief into growth—is clear and consistent, but she experiences little real friction or contradiction on the page. Her gift (tasting memories) and her self-understanding (“informally wise”) are mostly declarative rather than dramatized under pressure. The widow’s bitter soup is a promising source of internal conflict, yet its sadness is resolved almost instantly through pruning metaphors. The closing satisfaction feels somewhat unearned because we never see her substantially struggle to reach that serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly motivated (preserving wonder, compelled truthfulness) and her choices drive the action, but she experiences little real internal conflict; her traits rarely put her in painful tension. The involuntary truthfulness is more label than dramatized flaw, as it never truly costs her anything. Kael is functional but thin, existing mainly as an expositional counterpart. The closing sense of purpose feels earned enough, but it’s an easy, low-friction gain rather than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—understanding why some houses feel alive—is clear and consistent, and her sensory attentiveness gives her a distinctive cast. However, her inner life remains largely unconflicted; she encounters little resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. The key realization about “displaced objects” arrives as a tidy insight rather than something wrestled from difficult experience. As a result, the closing sense of purpose feels gentle and pleasant but not deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The statue’s motivation and arc—from rigid certainty to nuanced guardianship—are coherent and earned, especially once it recalls having chosen transformation “as a voluntary act of love.” However, its emotional life is summarized in abstract terms (“welcoming nuance,” “embrace complexity”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Internal conflict is implied but not dramatized in specific moments of hesitancy or regret. The final acceptance of community is conceptually strong but feels more like an idea shift than a fully felt, costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interior focus on the “texture of a missed opportunity” gives her a distinctive mindset. However, her emotional journey moves fairly smoothly from grim determination to acceptance, with limited dramatized internal contradiction or messy resistance at key beats. The final realization feels somewhat neat and low-cost—she gains insight but does not sacrifice much on the page. Her competence and clarity often override opportunities for flawed, pressure-driven missteps that would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—to gather “proof” that strangers remember kindness—remains clear and consistent, and her insomniac, ritual-driven temperament feels particular. The methodical nightly practice and her final decision that “sleep could wait” align her actions with that motive. However, her interiority skews monolithic; we don’t see much contradiction, doubt, or genuine struggle that would complicate her hope and heighten the emotional stakes. The result is a strong but somewhat low-conflict portrait rather than a fully pressured inner arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation as a historically oriented guardian of dying arts is vivid and consistent, and her actions—consulting ledgers, seeking elders, attempting reconstructions—flow cleanly from that core. Her emotional life is textured (the “rosewater dread,” sense of spiritual freeze), though internal contradiction under pressure could be sharpened further. Secondary figures are sketched more as atmospheric witnesses than as active sources of pressure. The final choice to climb for the succulents and bake is well motivated but emotionally a bit smooth, with limited visible cost beyond fatigue and prior disappointment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core drive—to step beyond fate’s design—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete choices (studying the yoyo, activating the clocks). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; she moves from intent to execution with little on-page ambivalence or degraded thinking under immense pressure. Emotions are often summarized in abstract terms (“a terrifying joy devoid of hope”) rather than embodied through specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The final state—peace in chaos—feels earned conceptually, but its emotional cost is more told than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—post-resuscitation survival by hacking her own fear—is clear, consistent, and specific, and her paradoxical relationship to fear (“hollow space nothing can fill” vs. “potential”) feels lived-in rather than generic. The tactile habits (fingering the clasp, carrying the dream dictionary) embody her anxiety and method. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened; she moves from shuddering reluctance to articulate insight a bit too smoothly for the extremity of the situation. Still, the final sense of peace reads earned by the choices and self-revelation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prophet’s vocation and core drive (“turn obstacles into instruments”) are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in how he greets the wave with purpose instead of fear. However, his interiority is mostly stated at a high, mythic level; we rarely see contradictory impulses, doubt, or cost beyond physical exertion. He reads as serenely competent throughout, which flattens emotional tension. A touch more friction between fatigue, fear, or temptation to surrender and his chosen purpose would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent (devotion to Aris, the lost expedition, and pattern languages), and his quiet persistence tracks cleanly into his choice to play the whistle. However, his interiority is largely summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told he is “quietly driven” and affected by “sunwashed dread,” but we don’t see much moment-to-moment hesitation, fear, or contradictory impulse as he acts. The ending shift from solitary cartographer to “translator for a city” is coherent but described more as a stated new role than a felt internal turn. Overall, he reads distinct and purposeful, but emotionally somewhat smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained, and her “cold and sharp” anger channeled into work gives her a credible professional psyche. However, her interiority leans on conceptual labels like “emotional rationality” instead of fully dramatized contradictions. The brief parallel to her own past silence hints at complexity but isn’t pushed into a real on-page dilemma. Her change by the end is essentially satisfaction at solving a puzzle rather than a costly internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation, temperament, and guilt are sharply drawn—“a man built for shorelines, stoically sensitive” whose surveyor’s precision informs his ritual. His motivation to atone by cataloging “abandoned dreams” is clear and consistent. The internal conflict between his forsaken personal dream and his self-imposed penance is present but handled somewhat declaratively near the end rather than fully dramatized through embodied struggle. A touch more concrete, contradictory behavior under pressure would lift him from strong to indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—an archivist’s need to correct a curated history—and her methods and tools (the stamp, tactile mapping) arise naturally from that. The internal shift from dutiful indexer of the official codex to believer in plural, messy origins is well earned. However, her “dappled resolve” is more told than dramatized; we seldom see real-time contradictory impulses genuinely pulling her in different directions. Emotional embodiment remains relatively cool and conceptual, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief, craft-focus, and belief that one thousand cranes might restore her shadow give her a clear, coherent motivation with some nuance (e.g., envy at the laughter-dream). The internal conflict between the soothing ritual and the agony it causes is well articulated but often summarized rather than dramatized in specific, idiosyncratic moments. Her final “choice” is more an endurance to completion than a fresh decision, so the arc feels emotionally credible but not deeply surprising. The sentient shadow remains more atmospheric than a fully pressuring counterpart, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s grief and obsessive need to locate “unused potential” give him a clear, specific motivation that coherently drives every action. Interiority is textured—“a title that felt less like a gift and more like a curse carved into his soul”—and the final shift from seeking a place to accepting a state of being reads as an earned internal reconfiguration. However, the peak realization leans on summary (“He simply *knew*”) rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure, softening the sense of actively contested impulses. His inner conflict (truth vs. the pain it brings) is more stated than enacted in distinct micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s motivation (to decode the frequency and find belonging) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it. However, his interiority stays fairly generic, with little contradiction or genuine struggle; “perpetually surprised” is stated but rarely dramatized in a way that changes behavior. The emotional turn from frustration to awe is believable but comes too easily, with minimal cost or ambivalence. The pilgrim functions more as a validating figure than as a relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s guilt, profession, and specific moral failure are sharply sketched, and her decision to stop manufacturing false memories is credibly earned from what we know of her. Interiority is concrete and tied to objects (watch hand, carvings), not just labels. There is some tidiness in her acceptance at the end—she arrives at “understanding” a bit smoothly, without much felt contradiction at the moment of recognition. Still, her flaw (cowardly self-protection) and cost (lifelong regret, the dead brother) land as character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motives (guilt over a past failure, desire to “recycle mistakes into wisdom”) are clear and consistent, and her interiority is particular enough to feel lived rather than generic. The small physical tic with the drawer pull grounds her emotional state. However, her inner conflict resolves a bit too cleanly; once she chooses her symbolic approach, there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk she might retreat into defensiveness. Kael is serviceable but thin, mostly functioning as a reactive foil with one confessional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s core drive (to redeem himself and “align heart and action”) is clear and consistently dramatized through his decision to launch, hug the shoreline, and continue after losing the compass. His interiority is specific enough to register as a particular person, though his regrets stay abstract—no concrete failed voyage or lost love surfaces to individualize him. The final shift from “broken navigator” to “just changed by the journey” feels earned by prior beats. However, the emotional palette leans on repeated labels (“backlash of regrets,” “flickered faith”) rather than newly embodied contradictions as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and consistent—seeking a way to feel empathy again—but it’s mostly stated rather than dramatized through specific, conflicting impulses. His emotions skew abstract (“barren soil of his heart”) instead of embodied, which flattens interiority. The final turn—accepting his dirty past as part of himself—fits the arc but feels somewhat easy, arriving via a quasi-mystical mechanism rather than hard-earned struggle. Still, his choices with the baseball and the decision to descend into the lake plausibly reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her reluctance about metamorphosis gives her a credible internal conflict, especially in the moment where she “let her human form unravel” despite fear. However, the emotional journey is often summarized in elevated abstractions (“deep, aching need,” “void that nothing in the living world could fill”) rather than dramatized through concrete, character-specific reactions. Her paradoxical steadiness is asserted and echoed but not deeply complicated by irrational impulses or mistakes. The relationship with Kael is touching yet sketched; we’re told its importance more than we feel it through lived, conflicting moments.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation (regret over squandered time, sharpened by new motherhood) is specific and consistent, and her tools/ritual choices track well with that drive. Interiority is concrete—she’s not generic “sad,” but aching over small, trivialized moments like the broken saucer. However, her internal conflict remains relatively smooth; she moves from perplexity to acceptance without much on-page resistance or self-sabotage. The final acceptance feels earned but a bit tidy, with limited sense of what she’s truly refusing or is likely to fail at later.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and pacifism are clearly rooted in her role as last steward and her commitment to non-violent “shadow work.” The happiness/weightlessness dynamic adds a concrete internal tension, especially when she must suppress joy to stay grounded. However, her interiority remains largely aligned and purposeful; we see little genuine contradiction or moral risk under pressure. The final crossing feels earned but emotionally smooth, with limited sense of what she sacrifices beyond the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motive—to understand “the texture of transformation”—is clear and consistent, and her final revaluation of poverty versus richness tracks with the setup. However, her interiority is largely told at a high level, with few concrete, character-specific contradictions or embodied emotional beats. The release of the lightning bugs arrives without visible internal resistance or mixed feeling, so the peak choice reads serene rather than pressured. The change she undergoes is plausible but too tidy and painless for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation and trait set (“calmly inventive” revolutionary, lock sentinel undermining the fort) are clear and consistent, and her actions align with them throughout. However, she faces almost no genuine resistance on the page, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or emotional cost—she is competent and purposeful but not internally conflicted. Interiority is mostly summarized (“felt a thrill, not of fear, but of purpose”) rather than embodied in idiosyncratic perceptions. The ending presents her as satisfied and waiting, but this change from sentinel to conspirator is asserted more than dramatically earned through tough choices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation (to understand the patterns and fulfill his mentor’s charge) is clear and consistently drives his choices, especially his frantic correction of the misaligned rock. The precognitive curse adds a concrete pressure on his interiority, though his emotional life stays mostly at the level of fear/urgency rather than richer contradiction. His final shift from cursed anxiety to calm comprehension is earned causally but feels relatively low-cost and tidy. Overall, he reads as specific but not yet deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation and interior world are clear and consistent—her drive to “map” scars and rarefy experience credibly leads her to the observatory and to writing again. The internal/external split (“furiously tranquil” exterior vs. cracking under lightning) gives her some dimensionality. However, the realization that scars are “like constellations” and the swift comfort with the ex-censor edge toward tidy epiphany rather than conflicted, costly change. The stranger’s characterization is thin and his redemption arc feels more asserted than earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation and professional temperament are clear, and his mechanical arm plus court-honed rhetoric give him some specificity. However, he encounters little genuine resistance—he decodes the puzzle cleanly, wins the duel, and accepts collaboration without visible ambivalence or cost. Interiority tends toward declarative summary (“His motivation burned brightly”) rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. The relationship with his opponent is thinly sketched, so the shift from rivalry to accord feels more conceptual than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply drawn—“vagrant penny poet” who molts personalities monthly is vivid, and her shift from cynical to hopeful is clearly motivated by the rebuilding project and her bond with Leo. Her internal stakes (fear/hope around each new self) are present but stay fairly low-pressure on the page, more described than dramatized. Leo functions well as a steady counterpoint and emotional anchor but remains comparatively thin. The final acceptance of her molting as “rhythm” rather than burden feels earned, though the cost of that acceptance is only lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s drive—to rewrite a fractured past and “surprise fate with an unplanned encore”—is clear and consistently embodied in his choices (testing the unproven film method, composing a new piece inside the refuge). His interiority is sometimes rendered in abstract labels (“steely longing,” “strategically creative”) rather than more individuated, contradictory impulses in the moment of decision. Still, the link between his emotional history (the frozen clock) and his actions is strong, and the final endurance in the monochrome ballroom feels earned. The main limitation is a relative lack of visible internal friction or truly costly ambivalence at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and consistent, and her role as “reality checker” is at least conceptually distinctive. However, her interiority stays generalized and declarative—“luminous doubt” is asserted more than dramatized through concrete, conflicting impulses in specific moments. Her choices (trust the dream, plant the seed, harvest the fruits) are sensible but face little psychological friction beyond a brief nod to fear of error. The ending acceptance of doubt as a guide feels stated rather than earned through a series of pressured, character-revealing micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation (to process regret and “find” his unspoken apologies) is clear and consistent, and his emotional state is embodied enough to feel specific rather than generic. However, his interiority moves in a fairly straight line from heaviness to insight without much real contradiction or self-sabotage in-scene, which flattens tension. Elian functions more as a calm guide and thematic mouthpiece than as an active relational crucible who pressures Kaelen’s choices. The final shift toward acceptance is credible but pays relatively little visible cost beyond a softened ache.

    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("simple yet profound") and modifiers ("thoughtfully spirited sigh") rather than embodied action. The internal struggle is summarized ("frozen in grief") and resolved too easily by looking at a bookmark, lacking genuine psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.6)
    Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through resistance; the protagonist's "burning curiosity" is an informed attribute rather than a felt pressure. The emotional arc resolves in a platitude ("courage to question") that feels unearned by the mechanical actions shown. J-7 is a vessel for the concept rather than a character making hard choices with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is declared rather than dramatized; Elara's desire for transparency feels like a thesis statement. The resolution relies on a sudden, convenient confession from Marco rather than an earned psychological shift or tactical maneuver by the protagonist. Emotional states are summarized ("spirits lifting") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara is defined entirely by static labels ("wisely pragmatic") and backstory summaries rather than present-moment choices under pressure. She faces no internal conflict or genuine external resistance, resulting in a character who performs competence without struggle. The lack of embodied emotion or specific interiority leaves her feeling like a fable archetype rather than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.3)

The realization about "fault-tolerance" reads as a diagnostic epiphany rather than an earned psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("veteran," "religiously skeptical") rather than demonstrated traits; the skepticism is stated but abandoned immediately when the plot requires belief in the radio's supernatural coincidence. Motivation ("weight of a swallowed truth") remains abstract and generates no specific, personal stakes or hard choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by stated motivation ("to witness change") rather than embodied struggle. Internal conflict is absent, as the "restlessness" is resolved without a difficult choice or revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies almost entirely on static labels ("mellow," "steadfast") rather than dramatized complexity. Elara lacks internal conflict or distinct interiority, functioning only as a perfect healer without struggle. Leo is a prop for the therapy, offering no genuine resistance or specific personality traits beyond "withdrawn," which flattens the relational dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a plot device rather than a character; he faces no internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses. The trait "sensitively perceptive" is asserted via label rather than dramatized through distinct observation or difficult choice. Elian succeeds without struggle, making his "sacred duty" feel like a low-stakes procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on stated labels ("cryptic," "former spy") and explicit declarations of motivation ("deep urge to transpose her life") rather than embodied desire. There is no internal conflict, distinct voice, or specific behavior; the characters function merely as vehicles to deliver prompt phrases in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher to execute the concept rather than a living character; he lacks interiority, specific traits, or emotional friction.

There is no felt cost to his actions; he operates the machinery of the plot without being changed by it.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is a cipher defined by labels rather than choices or internal contradictions. The trait "chronologically homesick" is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through behavior or resistance; she simply executes a linear series of actions without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("gravity defier," "periodically eternal") rather than embodied behavior. The protagonist functions as a vessel for prompt elements, with interiority delivered through abstract summary ("conquer the labyrinth of self") rather than specific, grounded emotion. The resolution involves a sudden internal switch ("let go") that feels unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly, but her emotional arc is summarized ("thawing the ice") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. She lacks agency in the climax, as Kael provides the solution (playing records backward) which she simply executes without resistance or complication. The transition from numbness to reawakening feels unearned by internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("calm resolve," "meticulous") rather than embodied emotion.

The protagonist feels like a vessel for prompt requirements rather than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on asserted labels (e.g., "ethically playful") rather than demonstrated behavior in scene. The protagonist's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") remains abstract, and the sacrifice of his memories lacks impact because those memories are summarized rather than dramatized with specific, felt detail.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; her internal state is conveyed through diagnostic labels ("weighed on her like stones," "her motivation was to find beauty") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulse. There is no struggle or meaningful choice; her actions are smooth and competent, lacking the friction or cost required to reveal character depth. The reliance on summary to explain her feelings ("Elara realized," "She understood") creates distance and prevents engagement with her specific human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    Motivation is asserted via abstract summary ("to fuse insight with empathy") rather than demonstrated through conflicted action or difficult choices. The character’s transformation is instant and frictionless, lacking the internal resistance or specific flaws that create depth. The arc reads as a declared status update rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=1.5)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by contradictory labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive") rather than dramatized action or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated diagnostic labels ("boldly sympathetic," "luminescent ache") rather than dramatized behavior or internal conflict.

The lack of distinct interiority or flaws makes her a functional vessel for the plot rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a procedural vehicle for the magic system rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is stated ("pure") rather than dramatized through struggle or internal contradiction. While the "natural history illustrator" tag frames the ending, it does not drive her tactics during the crisis, which rely solely on generic magical ability. Emotional interiority is replaced by explanatory narration, leaving her reactions flat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.9)
    Motivation is summarized via exposition ("pursue his lifelong motivation") rather than dramatized through conflict. The protagonist's emotional transformation is a "light switch" moment—instant acceptance after a vision—lacking the requisite struggle or visible cost for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his motivation is described as "pure" and "kindly methodical," resulting in an idealized caricature rather than a human agent. The emotional progression is linear and unearned, relying on label-heavy interiority ("sense memory," "fulfilled") rather than embodied struggle. There is no visible cost to his actions; he simply performs the required task with "content" satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's internal state is summarized through abstract labels ("testament to control," "reluctant metamorphosis") rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by abstract labels ("insomniac," "wryly earnest") rather than demonstrated behavior. His internal state is summarized through exposition ("ache of loss," "cynical humor") but lacks on-page embodiment or contradictory choices under pressure. The character feels like a vessel for prompt keywords rather than a living entity with genuine agency.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on stock archetypes ("pilgrim," "guardian") with explicit label-based interiority rather than embodied complexity. The "pure heart" realization is a generic trope that resolves the central tension without genuine psychological struggle or contradictory impulses. Emotional states are summarized ("unsettled him," "heart pounding") rather than dramatized through distinct behaviors or specific worldview frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on labels ("ocean-spray archivist," "reactively visionary") rather than embodied action or internal conflict. Elara functions as a plot device to deliver the solution, lacking distinct voice or human irrationality under pressure. The absence of a "crucible" or cost makes her motivation feel declared rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by labels ("meticulous," "analytically artistic") rather than dramatized behavior or internal contradiction. Emotions are abstract summaries ("trembling certainty") rather than embodied experiences. There is no struggle between competing impulses; she simply executes a sequence of actions with perfect competence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the prompt’s labels rather than a living character. Her skepticism is stated ("sympathetic skeptic") but discarded instantly upon touching the artifact, offering no internal resistance or meaningful choice. Motivation is abstract ("offer solace") and emotions are delivered via adjectives ("courageously kind") rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kaelen acts as a vessel for the concept rather than a living character; his "boredom" is stated in abstract terms ("ticking of a slow, cosmic clock") rather than felt through specific, embodied friction. The shift from boredom to awe is told in summary ("boredom shattered into something akin to awe") rather than dramatized through a distinct behavioral change. While the motivation is clear, the emotional landscape relies on label-heavy interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's core trait ("honest child") is contradicted by his actions (using a magical mind-altering object to manipulate the chief) without narrative acknowledgement of this irony. The "moral calculus" feels like a label rather than a dramatized struggle, and the internal logic regarding his refusal to use "tricks" collapses when he uses a supernatural shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the concept rather than a fully realized character; he lacks interior contradiction, embodied emotion, or high-stakes choices that would reveal depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is largely a passive vessel for the concept, observing rather than acting under pressure. His internal state is described via abstract labels ("betrayal, fear") rather than embodied in specific, difficult micro-choices. While motivation is clear, it lacks the friction of an opposing force or internal contradiction to drive a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on labeled emotions ("gloomy cheerfulness") rather than embodied feeling or behavior. The protagonist lacks agency in the present moment, serving as a passive vessel for backstory and abstract philosophical conclusions without navigating a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on explanatory labels ("culture shock absorber," "dual allegiance") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal state is summarized—she feels "familiar tension" and "hopeful desperation"—without embodying these conflicts in a difficult choice or contradictory reaction. The "dual allegiance" is stated but does not complicate her actions, as she acts entirely in service of the resistance without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("purposefully curious," "insatiable need") rather than embodied action or choice. Internal states are summarized ("despair that threatened to cloud her mission") rather than dramatized through specific thoughts or physical reactions to pressure. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Elara is a static observer who faces no difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is a stock archetype ("magical disabled artisan") with no internal contradictions or genuine flaws. Her blindness acts as a convenient superpower rather than a constraint, preventing any cost-bearing choices or character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on adverbs and narrator assertions ("subtly confident," "motivation was simple yet profound") rather than demonstrated behavior. The "dry wit" appears only once as a spoken line ("Glaciers make poor cartographers"), feeling like an inserted trait rather than a pervasive voice. Internal conflict is nominal ("nagging worry") and does not drive choices or create genuine hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined solely by the label "infinitely patient" and a "pure" motivation stated in exposition. He faces no internal conflict, doubt, or difficult choices, functioning as a mechanical device rather than a living character. Lacking any struggle or cost, his success generates no emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies entirely on declared labels ("His motivation was singular") rather than embodied desire. Kaelen functions as a mechanical vessel for the prompt elements without internal contradiction or distinct personality. The panic is stated ("screamed at him") rather than felt through sensory distortion or specific thought.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kaelen's internal landscape is rendered through abstract metaphors ("tapestry of distrust") rather than embodied emotion or specific memory, distancing the reader from his stakes. The moral weight of the "dead guards" remains vague—accident or murder?—which muffles the desperation of his need for redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    Character motivation is summarized via exposition ("Her motivations were ancient," "deep sadness") rather than dramatized through behavior or internal struggle. Elian's emotional state is delivered through abstract labels like "mournful elation" rather than visceral, embodied reaction. The protagonist lacks agency, merely receiving the ghost's object and reacting with prescribed emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic label-speak ("poetic wharf weaver," "hauntingly optimistic") rather than dramatized traits or embodied emotion. There is no internal conflict or competence limit; Elara succeeds with a "dreamer's certainty" that removes all struggle and human specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on inserted labels ("warmly curious," "diaspora returnee") rather than demonstrated behavior. The protagonist faces no internal contradiction or genuine psychological cost, and her success is inevitable, making her a passive vehicle for the plot rather than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on assertive labels ("pseudonym creator," "deep-seated need") rather than dramatized behavior or internal contradiction. Elara faces no difficult micro-choices that reveal values; she simply performs a procedural task without emotional or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's dual nature is clear, and the shift from passive observation to active intervention drives the arc. However, the narrative relies on diagnostic telling ("This was her chosen disguise," "The foolish old woman was... the only one") rather than trusting the dramatization of her behavior to convey the depth of the mask.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara’s internal state relies heavily on labeled emotions ("fierce tenderness," "aching love") rather than embodied reactions, creating narrative distance. Her pivotal change is triggered by an external instruction (the leaf message) rather than a decision born of internal pressure, resulting in a low-agency protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.0)
    Elara functions as a vessel for abstract themes rather than a living character; her motivation ("to graft new meaning") is stated as a thesis rather than felt as a drive. The "shrewdly innocent" trait is applied as a label to both her and the boy, but never demonstrated through a difficult choice or behavioral paradox. The emotional arc is linear and soothing, lacking the internal contradiction or cost required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the prompt rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradictions or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on expository labels ("charming rogue scholar," "motivation was simple yet profound") rather than embodied action. Elara’s internal state is summarized rather than felt, and her "candidly cryptic" attribute manifests as a single line of staged dialogue ("beetles dance to a tune") rather than a consistent worldview. The antagonists are stock figures barking generic villain lines ("unlicensed thoughts are forfeit"), lacking genuine menace.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.5)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by abstract labels ("insomniac," "wanderer") and the prompt's specific phrasing rather than embodied interiority or specific desire. There is no on-page struggle or contradiction; the character functions as a static vessel for the "photosynthesize pain" motivation without making any dramatized choices. The emotional arc is summarized ("warmth spread through his chest") rather than felt through action or specific sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict; her emotions are delivered via the repeated label "foxglove regret" rather than embodied experience. She functions solely to execute the plot's linear tasks without hesitation or personal cost, resulting in a flat character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara’s internal landscape is defined by explanatory summary ("Her motivation was clear") rather than embodied struggle. The attribute "carefully reckless" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through choices that carry visible risk or cost. The resolution relies on a magical mechanism to bypass the interpersonal friction required to earn forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is defined by abstract labels ("ingenious," "innate curiosity") rather than choices made under pressure.

The character functions as a competent vehicle for the plot without internal contradiction or distinct psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.7)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("betrayal that had shattered her world," "struggled to recall") rather than dramatized behavior or specific interiority. The protagonist's pivotal "forgotten secret" regarding the chip functions as a convenient authorial patch rather than a consistent trait. Emotional shifts, such as learning to trust, occur in broad summary rather than through cost-laden micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist lacks specific interiority or contradictory impulses, functioning merely as a vehicle for the prompt's thematic concepts. The attribute "featherly determined" is applied as a static label rather than demonstrated through action, and her "intuition" replaces genuine struggle or decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("deep motivation," "soft ingenuity") rather than embodied action. Elara lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she transitions from seeking to finding without facing a meaningful choice or cost. The "landscape astrologer" role feels like a costume, as her actions (looking at charts, walking halls) are generic.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by his job title and labeled emotions ("sorrow," "joy," "determination") rather than embodied experience. There is no internal conflict or active struggle; Kaelen serves merely as a camera for the magical objects, reacting with generic sentimentality ("smiled, knowing that while some paths vanish...").

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as an idealized cipher of competence rather than a character with genuine interiority or struggle. She faces no internal conflict, makes no difficult tradeoffs, and her success is absolute, resulting in a static emotional arc without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a thematic cipher rather than a living character; her internal experience is described through abstract labels ("agonizing yet exquisite," "surge of power") rather than embodied sensation. There are no contradictory impulses or hesitations; she executes a pre-planned ritual without a micro-choice that reveals values or incurs a dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for philosophical abstraction than a living character; her motivation is stated ("illuminate value") rather than felt through messy, contradictory impulses. The interiority relies on high-minded labels ("commune," "essence") rather than specific, embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.4)
    Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic label-speak ("deep-seated pain," "grim understanding," "transmute personal agony") rather than embodied emotion or action.

The narrative tells us she is "tough" and "tender" without dramatizing these traits through specific behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.9)
    Elara functions as a magical operator without internal contradiction or cost; her emotions are described ("dreamer's heart") rather than embodied in difficult choices or reactions to failure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is defined by labels ("sensitively perceptive") and her job title rather than specific, pressurized choices.

There is no internal conflict; she moves from curiosity to understanding without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)
    Lyra functions as a vessel for prompt attributes rather than a character with conflicting desires or agency. Her "motivation" and "nature" are delivered via expository labels ("Lyra’s motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal resistance. There is no felt cost to her actions, leaving her emotional landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("doubt," "fear," "compassion") rather than embodied emotion or specific interiority. The protagonist's motivation ("redemption") is summarized in exposition without immediate, felt pressure or specific grounding in her past. She functions as a generic vessel for the ritual rather than a distinct individual making difficult choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is defined by explicit labels ("amoral philanthropist," "secretly sentimental") rather than behavior, leaving the central contradiction stated rather than dramatized. While the internal struggle is referenced, the "amoral" side offers no genuine, costly alternative to the walk in the present moment, making the choice feel pre-decided. The character functions effectively as a vessel for the ritual but lacks the specific, contradictory interiority of a fully realized persona.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("simple yet profound") rather than dramatized through conflicted action. The protagonist functions as a vessel for the theme, lacking visceral interiority or specific, embodied struggle beyond the magical operation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("moral ambiguity," "blank-faced") and summarized backstory (reporting neighbors) rather than on-page choices or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but stated abstractly ("pure: to preserve the shape of hope") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses during the act. The "luminous regret" at the closure feels like a label applied after the fact rather than an embodied emotion wrestled with in the moment. The internal landscape is coherent, but the emotional turn relies on retrospective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated, but her emotional processing is depicted through a schematic summary of "shedding layers" rather than a dramatized struggle. While the choice to reject "false reconstruction" adds some depth, the internal conflict feels therapeutic and tidy, lacking the visceral messiness of genuine trauma response.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.7)
    Aris functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's required traits rather than a fully realized protagonist.

The emotional arc feels unearned, relying on a convenient magical epiphany to resolve internal trauma without visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by abstract labels ("moonstruck dreamer") rather than specific, contradictory desires or behaviors.

The emotional arc is linear and lacks the resistance or irrationality of a genuine character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict, described explicitly as "unswayed by nightmares or desires," which renders her static until the final paragraph. The transition from "dreamless" to welcoming dreams reads as a toggle switch rather than a transformation earned through high-stakes choices. Her motivation is "etched into her," removing agency and reducing her to a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.1)
    Character motivation is asserted ("Her motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through struggle or contradictory impulses.

While his internal shift is legible, it lacks the visceral struggle required to make the decision to "bear witness" feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.7)

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen functions primarily as a thematic vessel; their emotional arc from despair to hope is summarized ("surged with understanding") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult on-page choices. The internal state is articulated clearly, but the resolution feels unearned by struggle, relying on a passive realization to solve the character's central drift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.4)

There is no moment of doubt or renunciation; her path is linear and morally unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies almost entirely on diagnostic labels ("somatic marker," "drone strike wedding survivor") and summary rather than dramatized behavior.

There is no contradictory impulse or struggle in the scene; she acts exactly as the "resilient survivor" archetype dictates without deviation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("crestfallen," "fragmented") rather than dramatized behavior, resulting in a passive vessel for the theme. The internal struggle is summarized as a smooth "descent" without the friction of contradictory impulses or specific, embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kael functions more as a vehicle for the experiment than a character under pressure; his motivation is purely intellectual with no personal stakes or potential for loss.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by the label "cool-headed," which is asserted rather than tested by a genuinely difficult choice.

The lack of struggle or flaws makes his success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kael is defined by abstract labels ("vessel of calm," "phototropic to kindness") rather than demonstrated traits.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aris is consistent but defined largely by explicit motivation labels rather than complex interiority. Evans functions as a plot device; her rapid shift from "cold with calculated anger" to respect undermines the established antagonism and lowers the credibility of the "political creature" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions more as a thematic device than a fully realized character; her "methodical" nature is asserted but contradicts the purely intuitive leap she makes at the climax. The face-blindness is an interesting hook, but her ability to deduce complex emotional histories and specific physical actions (a "pull" vs. a "push") from a single scrap of ribbon feels like unearned omniscience rather than character-grounded competence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on repeated labels ("nervously confident" appears three times) rather than demonstrated behavior. Motivation is stated as a resume point ("honor an ancestor’s overlooked bravery") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.6)
    Character motivation is established through backstory summary rather than dramatized desire; Elara faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices, resulting in a flat trajectory where she succeeds without internal conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined by asserted traits ("guarded," "emotions locked away") rather than behavior; her internal landscape is summarized via metaphor rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The resolution—her own guardedness "unbending" instantly upon the external victory—feels unearned and lacks psychological causality. There is no resistance or struggle in her transformation, merely a parallel reaction to the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies almost exclusively on diagnostic labeling ("root-bound visionary," "purposefully curious") rather than demonstrated behavior. The protagonist’s motivation is stated outright ("Her motivation burned clear") instead of emerging from conflict or desire.

The protagonist experiences no genuine contradictory impulses in scene, leading to a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype rather than a character, defined solely by his role without internal contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.9)
    Kaelen acts as a passive vessel for the prompt's emotional demands rather than a grounded character.

The lack of internal conflict renders his final decision effortless and melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated clearly, but the protagonist reads more as a collection of prompt constraints than a living psyche. The trait "truth-seeking" is a label, and the internal struggle is resolved too neatly by a single external platitude, bypassing genuine psychological cost or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and she exhibits agency at the climax, but her interiority relies heavily on prompt-inserted labels ("mulberry ache," "perforated destiny") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara functions as a vessel for prompt words rather than a character with embodied interiority. Her traits are delivered via labels ("notably receptive") rather than action, and her decision-making is linear and conflict-free. There is no internal contradiction or cost to her choices; she simply thinks until she solves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist relies on diagnostic labels ("mournfully eager") and stock phrases ("eyes holding centuries of unshed tears") rather than embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    Eli is defined by explicit labels ("ardent," "resiliently positive") rather than choices made under pressure. He lacks internal conflict or a distinct personality beyond his function to solve the plot's puzzle. The absence of a difficult trade-off or personal cost makes his "burning need" feel asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated via exposition ("pure: to discover...") rather than dramatized through choice; emotional reactions are labeled ("knot of unease," "peace") rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and drives the action through a clear tactical shift at the climax. While the "coppery veins" serve mostly as aesthetic signaling until the end, her identity as a storyteller authentically shapes her problem-solving. The final choice to harmonize rather than dominate earns the resolution, though the emotional interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("desperation clawed").

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.4)

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stated as an abstract "singular" drive rather than felt through conflicting desires or difficult choices. The emotional resolution—seeing her mother and immediately finding "profound peace"—lacks psychological complexity or cost, relying on a "sad smile" cliché rather than a character-specific reaction to trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, defined entirely by labels ("unassumingly bold," "enigmatic") rather than contradictory desires or idiosyncratic behavior. Interiority is summarized through abstract nouns ("longing," "courage") instead of embodied sensation or specific thought. There is no internal conflict; Elian acts as a mechanical tool to advance the plot without personal cost or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a character with embodied interiority; her "chronically curious nature" is a stated label rather than a driver of difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or moment of doubt; she performs the ritual and succeeds without paying a personal price. The emotional arc is summarized through adjectives ("piercing," "nostalgic") rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Archivist is distinct, but Elian's pivot from defiance to vulnerability ("I've been so angry") feels diagnostic and rapid, lacking the on-page struggle to earn such self-awareness. The interaction relies on therapeutic dialogue rather than dramatic friction, making the emotional arc feel linear and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on labels ("wise," "insatiable creative") rather than choices made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the prompt's terminology rather than a living character; her internal state is described via repeated labels ("lucid unrest") rather than embodied emotion. Kael exists solely as a sounding board to receive exposition. The "secret" revealed at the end feels like an aphorism rather than a character-driven disclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("methodically curious," "perceptive map framer") rather than demonstrated traits or specific interiority. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Elara flows through the scene with perfect emotional calibration, and the resolution lacks any personal cost or transformation beyond the stated "deepening."

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character, with traits like "quietly analytic" applied as labels rather than demonstrated through complex choices. The emotional arc feels processed and theoretical, relying on diagnostic phrases ("inner turmoil," "sophisticated melancholy") instead of embodied reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is a vessel for abstract longing rather than a character with agency; her needs are stated via exposition ("yearned to articulate") rather than dramatized through struggle.

The result is a passive archetype rather than a living individual.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is a passive observer who encounters no internal conflict or genuine obstacles; her primary action is reading a found object. Motivation is established through direct labeling ("warmly inquisitive") rather than dramatized desire or struggle. There are no micro-choices under pressure, as the tools and opportunity are provided to her without cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies entirely on labeled emotions ("profound grief," "suppressed rage") rather than embodied experience. The protagonist lacks agency and struggle; his internal state is solved by the very method he posits at the start, creating a circular, cost-free progression. There is no distinct interior voice, only a vehicle for prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is compelling, but the depiction of prosopagnosia (face blindness) is scientifically flawed; the condition does not prevent distinguishing book covers, making the central search obstacle feel artificial. The "hidden safe" problem is resolved by a convenient backstory item (the coin) rather than character ingenuity in the moment, reducing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on repetitive labels ("diligently curious") rather than dramatized choice or internal conflict. Emotions are summarized ("heart raced", "trembling") rather than embodied, and the protagonist lacks a distinct voice or psychological depth beyond the plot's immediate needs.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.6)
    Elara is a cipher defined by abstract yearning rather than concrete struggle; she faces no difficult choices, pays no costs, and her competence is absolute ("hands steady") rather than tested.

    Characterization relies on archetypal labels ("mechanic," "botanist") and summarized histories rather than behavior in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.9)
    Elara functions as a mechanical vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character. The key trait "beautifully flawed" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through specific internal contradictions or difficult choices. Her motivation is stated as "etched into her soul" but lacks on-page emotional texture or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal shift from reluctance to acceptance is summarized ("feeling less like a burden") rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice. The "stubborn need" flares conveniently to override her reluctance without a felt cost or hesitation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on labeled emotions ("grieving heart," "discordant dirge") rather than dramatized internal conflict or embodied reaction. The protagonist's shift from guilt to peace feels unearned, driven by a convenient epiphany rather than a struggle between contradictory impulses or values. "Symphonically minded" is asserted as a trait but functions only as a source of metaphors rather than a distinct cognitive lens affecting his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's keywords rather than existing as a realized character.

She experiences no internal conflict or doubt, and her interaction with the flat, compliant representatives lacks genuine relational pressure or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara functions as a collection of prompt-dictated labels rather than a dramatized consciousness; her "helix-minded" nature is asserted via exposition but does not shape her perceptions or choices in a specific, tangible way. There is no internal contradiction or resistance; she desires an abstract goal, performs a magical action without error, and succeeds without personal cost. The character remains a static vessel for the plot's concept rather than a human agent navigating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined by abstract labels ("prism-mind," "seeds") rather than specific psychological depth, and her success relies on possessing the right items rather than making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara serves as a functional vehicle for the plot but lacks internal life, contradictory impulses, or genuine struggle. Her motivation is stated rather than felt through sacrifice or difficult choices, and her "symphonically minded" nature appears as a repetitive label rather than a demonstrated trait tested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.5)
    Kael functions as a vessel for the prompt rather than a living character; his emotions are labeled ("heavy," "haunted") rather than embodied in action or contradictory impulse.

There is no cost to his transformation; he simply observes the past and is healed.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s internal drive is clear, and her agency propels the escalation from borrowing personalities to the desperate climax of self-insertion. While the "borrowed" personas offer vivid vignettes, Elara’s "true self" remains somewhat theoretical until the end, making the return to "wholeness" feel slightly less earned than the disorientation preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kaelen's "jitteriness" is a labeled trait that evaporates without genuine struggle or escalation, offering no resistance to the narrative's resolution.

The internal arc is linear and frictionless, lacking the contradictory impulses or emotional cost required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on stock sentimental tropes rather than specific, embodied emotion. The decision to sacrifice herself feels like a mandated plot point rather than a choice earned through a complex internal struggle or tactical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is a competent protagonist whose motivation to rescue tradition is clearly established.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clearly drives the narrative, but her internal landscape lacks friction; she moves from desire to execution with high competence but minimal doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.7)
    Motivation is asserted ("defined by a single, unwavering truth") rather than dramatized through complex choices or internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies on romanticized labels ("vagrant penny poet," "scholar's mind") rather than individuated behavior or speech.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a complex agent; his primary trait ("strategically creative") is asserted via label rather than demonstrated through improvisation under pressure.

    Motivation clear and rooted in reflective traits, intensifying through gear insight to compel reassembly; actions align precisely with curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)

    Motivation rooted in arsonist father strongly compels graft choice, earning redemption with felt lineage cost; interior conflict embodied in humming father's tune during procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's luminous skepticism grounds her realistic imagination, shown in deciphering light-shadow patterns amid grit; motivation to liberate memories intensifies via box's growing weight and whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation to preserve light intensifies credibly from anomaly discovery to encoding choice, with embodied unease via cold gear.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation rooted in grief quest drives consistent micro-choices like unrolling ribbons and matching to butterflies; interiority concrete in poem whispers and memory links.

    Motivation clear and consistent in diligent adjustments tied to past flood guilt, with embodied reverie during pauses; internal conflict shows via trembling hands yielding to surety.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation rooted in copyist diligence drives progression from listening to embedding codes in scores, with micro-choices like whispering to dust earning the final endurance. Interiority embodied via pulse quickening and dust wonder, but internal conflict remains subtle without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final kinship surge with broadcaster acknowledgment feels earned, foreclosing safer isolation with risk cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to crystallize forgiveness drives ritual choices with embodied contradiction—jagged edges bite palms amid "resin of regret and hope." Internal conflict emerges in weaving flawed kindness into portrait, earning lighter heart. Minor slip: early label "weaves truth carefully" borders diagnostic before full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong interior contradiction between doubt and determination shown through embodied actions like pocketing the cog and scraping layers; final endurance earned by prior agony. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("rationally rebellious") repeated without full embodiment slightly undercuts peak specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation to welcome nuance intensifies credibly through revelations, rooted in kind traits; interiority particular via telepathic tendrils piercing solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation rooted in rebellion against time drives precise micro-choices like yoyo manipulation; embodied emotion peaks in "bleak exhilaration—a terrifying joy devoid of hope." Internal conflict subdued, lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal reversal beat, but final endurance earned with hollow freedom cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation rooted in post-resuscitation hollowness intensifies through embodied dread (shuddering, trembling voice), compelling the confession micro-choice; advisor's pressure reveals character limits without safety-hedging. Internal conflict embodied in paradoxical notes acting simultaneously. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "I am afraid..." confession slightly undercuts peak authenticity but doesn't touch closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation to transform obstacles is clear and drives all actions consistently; micro-choices with mallet and dubbing reveal values effectively. Limited interior contradiction or embodied emotional layering weakens depth, with emotions more performed than simultaneous impulses in pivotal strikes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen's quietly driven trait roots motivation and compels whistle sequence derivation under dread pressure, with steady hands vs. swimming horizon showing embodied contradiction; earned shift to shared purpose forecloses isolation with felt communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong motivation rooted in fierce clarity drives deciphering the "veritas" clue; embodied emotion in "cold and sharp" anger channels into research without therapy-speak. Interiority particular via life parallel, revealing sacrifice empathy. Minor label reliance on "emotional rationality" slightly abstracts peak realization.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stoically sensitive trait embodied effectively in "his exterior granite hiding a core of deep-feeling silt," constraining sorrow during note placement without diagnostic labels; final confession earns internal change with cost of personal dream foreclosure. Minor slip in alternating summary of traits over simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong interiority via tactile micro-choices like stamping margins and probing drawer reveal contradictory impulses (doubt vs resolve); earned change at scroll discovery forecloses neat indexing with felt cost of messy truth. Minor label-speak ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") slightly abstracts embodiment in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation clear and intensifies via embodied grief during gem polishing; contradictory impulses (ignore shadow, channel pain into craft) act simultaneously. Final shadow merger earned by persistent micro-choices in folding cranes. Shadow as sentient entity applies external pressure without diluting single-POV interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses of profound sorrow and manic energy act simultaneously in the experiment; final realization earned by geode perturbation and overload, foreclosing hunt with felt cost of unchanged weight.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation to decode belonging drives consistent drone guidance and lever pull; embodied pull and frustration add specificity. Perpetual surprise trait told repeatedly without constraining a costly choice, limiting internal conflict depth. Final awe feels earned but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong interior contradiction between fabricating lies and seeking truth, embodied in clutching the watch hand; final renunciation earned via carving discovery with felt cost of carrying silence. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("guilt that twisted her insides") borders therapy-speak but anchors to present object.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's thoughtful trait drives concrete micro-choices like placing the drawer pull, earning her internal untethering with felt guilt cost; Kael's softening adds relational pressure. Internal conflict embodied in chest-tightening recall and steady voice. Minor label-speak ("uncommonly thoughtful") slightly abstracts without full trade-off visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, like gripping compass amid waves; earned change at laugh after loss reveals flawed navigator's acceptance. Minor diagnostic repetition of "align heart and action" slightly abstracts peak interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation to kindle empathy roots in echoed past sins and compels climax plea to reflection; interior conflict embodied in hesitant heartbeat mirroring bioluminescence. Change earned as memories flood via ball return, foreclosing indifference with felt cost. Minor therapy-speak in "plant a seed of feeling" slightly abstracts pivotal acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation to reforge the bond drives concrete micro-choices like crushing spices despite fear; contradictory impulses peak in "Reluctantly, she let her human form unravel... yet she remained paradoxically steady," earning the final endurance with visible permanence cost. Minor summary dilutes some embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional embodied motivation (sharp ache driving ritual) and contradictory impulses (willing perplexity embraces confusion yet compels deliberate micro-choices like palm-pressing). Final reclamation earned via prior causality, foreclosing regret path with felt cost in weaving thread. No unearned epiphanies; interiority concrete and particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in gravitational shifts during joy/hope moments force micro-choices like mental anchoring, earning the pacifist crossing at closure with integrated shadow cost. Interiority particular via light-strands perception and non-violent weaving. Pacifist trait compels all tactics without violence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation clear and intensifies to realization, but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the release scene; interiority summarizes philanthropy via reflection blocks without micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation clear and consistent in sparking revolution, rooted in dissident traits, but interiority relies on labels like "calmly inventive nature had foreseen this" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices showing simultaneous impulses. No deep internal conflict dramatized; success feels competent but untested by genuine struggle or blind spots. Final smile earns minor endurance but lacks prior causal buildup of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority through visions and embodied fear ("fingers numb with cold and fear"), with micro-choices like rock adjustment revealing hierarchy of values; minor slip in told "pure" motivation slightly abstracts drive before pivotal pour.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara's motivation to rarefy scars into poetry is consistent and intensifies to compel writing the poem under timer pressure. Interiority concrete via scar reflections, but contradictory impulses summarized rather than acting simultaneously in pivotal writing beat. Stranger's late arrival adds pressure but minimal crucible testing prior to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Label-speak like "diplomatically fierce, a trait honed in courts" undermines embodied traits, but mechanical arm's "whirring softly" and duel revelation show contradiction between force and diplomacy effectively; final collaboration earned by prior puzzle-solving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's molting trait yields concrete contradiction ("raw and renewed") that compels mission endurance; Leo's steadiness anchors without depth. Final friendship as unshaken costs prior cynicism, earned via prior cues. Minor epiphanies like "luminous fracture widen" feel told, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian's steely longing is embodied through piano play and film threading, with contradictory melancholy-to-wild shift earned in the ballroom climax. Strategic creativity enables the chord-door interaction without label-only flaws. Final encore renunciation of past forecloses regret path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation to protect heritage drives consistent actions, but luminous doubt resolves too tidily without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the rushed harvesting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen's interiority is concrete and embodied, with regrets as "cerulean waters" tying to micro-choices like tracing lace; Elian applies subtle pressure as tutor. Earned change via diffusion feels motivated by flaws in unspoken words. Minor slip: final nod risks tidy epiphany without peak contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    Interiority is rich and specific to Aris’s scientific lens, but the emotional arc is largely observational—no contradictory impulse forces a costly micro-choice. The “kindled humility” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture. earns stasis is credible, yet the cost feels abstract because the story never threatens her with any concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—hands trembling, molding fear into focus—yet the moment she decodes the ledger the prose pivots to exposition, telling us “motivation deepened” rather than showing a contradictory impulse in scene. The adaptive trait is asserted, not dramatized; no visible trade-off or cost attaches to her decision to create rather than retaliate. Closure is a declared stance (“shine brighter”) without a micro-choice that forecloses an alternate path. Still, her perceptual filter—glass art, frost patterns—remains consistent and character-specific, keeping the score above mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s survivor-guilt engine is clear and embodied; the fork-against-palm micro-choice shows contradictory impulse (penance vs. creation). Static gesture repetition (“rectify” hammered 6×) flattens interior hierarchy; no new micro-choice after midpoint. Still, her final charged poise—viewing the color-symphony she alone can “hear”—earns renunciation cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elijah’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is asserted but never dramatized—he never fights, doubts, or pays for it; the undertaker vocation supplies mood yet zero occupational leverage under water. The interiority drifts into abstract thematic summary (“rest had found its permanent address”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure is gentle but cost-free: weariness simply lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s gently persistent trait is repeatedly named but never weaponized under pressure; the bell is clutched and rung yet her interiority stays generic (“thoughts as heavy as humid air”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the climactic declaration feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Still, her calm micro-command keeps volunteers oriented and the generational bridge is credibly maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lush and camera-specific, but the healing quest is declared rather than dramatized through contradiction; the breathing mechanic is used as observation, not a micro-choice that costs her anything. The “unused love” metaphor is reiterated instead of tested by a conflicting want. Still, the embodied pacing of breath-to-image keeps her from sliding into label-speak and the final fusion of artist/healer is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s obsession with “the texture of time” is concrete, embodied in her tactile manipulation of the maze and the halo fragment; her escalating desperation is shown through micro-choices (adjusting folds, walking the paths) that visibly cost her grip on memory. The retrocognitive prison is dramatized, not labeled: each pulse of the shard forces her to watch unalterable moments, creating interior contradiction (desire to witness vs. need to escape). The ending renunciation—accepting time’s fractal weave—earns its poise because the prior beats have foreclosed every simpler escape; the dim fragment in her palm is the charged keepsake of that cost. Interiority stays particular to her designer perception (hyperbolic angles, vine tension) and never slides into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “patiently strategic” trait is shown twice—waiting at the start, then the silent piano decoding—but both beats are narrated rather than dramatized; we watch the label, not the tactical calculus. The ankle chains appear first as décor, then once as trip-wire; their loosening at the end is symbolic, not earned by a prior physical or moral cost. Interiority is limited to stoic-resolve summary (“her spirit was unbroken”), so contradictory impulses never collide on the page. The single antagonist is a cardboard “guard loyal to the old regime” who lunges and stumbles in one beat, supplying no status shift or relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—synesthetic perception of color-as-sound threads every beat—but her contradictory impulses arrive summarized (“she realized trust breaking wasn’t a single sound”) rather than dramatized in the forge moment. The micro-choice to reframe absences as healing potential is visible, yet the prior emotional fuel (friend’s lie) is recalled rather than re-felt under aurora pressure, softening the cost. Flaw-competence balance is good: trembling hands, blurred colors, but no strategic error that compounds. Earned stasis lands, but the epiphany feels gently rather than viscerally paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s yearning to “listen for destiny’s door” is vivid, but we see only one micro-choice—swap the portrait—and it’s friction-free; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is tested. The “quietly savvy” label is repeated but never complicates the action; she glides through perils without error or interior cost. Competence is balanced with struggle only by assertion, not dramatized tension. Closure is a felt triumph, yet no path is foreclosed; the portrait remains an unscratched talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured through glass-specific verbs and the cracked bookmark as a lived correlative for grief, but the “contemplative” label is repeated rather than dramatized; the single real choice—abandoning the studio—happens off-page, so the renunciation cost is declared, not embodied. Emotions stay sensory (breath misting, fingers steady) yet lean toward the same register of poised melancholy; a sharper contradictory impulse in-scene would have lifted the arc above lyrical stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is vivid (“his world recently shattered,” “panicked breath to sharpen focus”) and fears are embodied, but Leo’s contradiction—declaring vulnerability power—arrives as a thematic summary at the climax rather than being dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs him on the page. Eli functions only as a prop-trigger; no relationship pressure or status shift is tested. The seashell’s whisper is atmospherically used but never alters Leo’s tactical choices; its meaning is asserted, not enacted. Earned stasis is claimed (“he walked away, forever changed”) yet the on-page cost is emotional assertion rather than a foreclosed path we watch him refuse.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oracle’s “mild obsession” is the only interior motive we ever get; it is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse under pressure. She performs the ritual perfectly, without setback or micro-choice that would reveal flaw or cost, so the final “profound peace” feels pre-ordained rather than earned. The booklet glows, the star pulses, the map appears—she remains static, a spectator to her own magic.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    J-7’s quest to locate the “source of thought” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a live dilemma; the robot remains calm, no contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, and the final insight (“thoughts come from repetition and errors”) is pronounced rather than earned through a visible, costly micro-choice. The memory-wipe procedure is referenced as backstory but never tests or alters its present stance; its composure is asserted, not strained. Interiority stays schematic, cycling stock phrases (“consumed its cycles,” “burning curiosity”) without idiosyncratic perception. Closure lands as conceptual summary, not as a reconfiguration forced by sacrifice or risk; hence the arc feels observed, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s quiet resolve and methodical lens-and-ticket investigation feel specific, but her interiority stays calm-surface; the “mistrust” is asserted more than embodied. Marco’s guilt-driven entrance supplies a late emotional jolt, yet his shift from fear to confession is compressed into a single beat, so the cost feels rushed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s devotion and tactile ritual are vivid, but interiority stays safely single-note; no contradictory impulse ever threatens her resolve, so the arc is flat. The “withered” body is shown only in opening label; hands prune, but pain, fatigue, or doubt never complicate action. Because she never risks failure or must choose between garden and self, the final proof feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s obliging nature is shown through his quiet, self-driven mission rather than explicit service beats; his internal contradiction—seeking validation yet shunning glory—peaks in the lever pull that risks ridicule. The moment of shared awe with Dr. Aris crystallizes a status shift from mechanic to co-discoverer, but we never see how his kindness might complicate or cost him. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“tools clicking softly against his hips”), but the epiphany is softly stated rather than dramatized through a visible renunciation or new risk. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (truth > personal acclaim) is legible and paid for in the fading hologram’s light.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s lone, sustained POV is sharply particular: her fingers clutch a humidity-soft program, her throat hums a dead composer’s phrase, her thighs push through chest-high water—each micro-choice is embodied, urgent, and tied to the ghost-code stake. The “lately inspired” trait is more label than lived contradiction, but her visible shiver when water stains bloom into notes shows authentic intrusion of awe under pressure. The final slapped-water percussion is a credible renunciation of silence that forecloses her prior observer role; cost is felt in the soaked program she still carries. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status tests waive; interiority alone carries the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority drifts into diagnostic self-speak (“fault-tolerant oracle,” “swallowed truth”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses; the fever recovery and sensor recalibration beats show micro-action but never test her predictive gift under live stakes, so her arc stays abstract. The swallowed-truth motivation is declared repeatedly yet never dramatized as a specific memory or externalized conflict, so the promised emotional weight stays conceptual. No relationship or secondary character pressure is on the page, leaving her essentially alone with a label.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s skeptical, rust-trusting worldview is consistently embodied; the moment he fingers the beaded wheel we feel his forensic itch. His drowsy-alert state is shown through narrowed sensory filters rather than labels. The final gesture—replacing the valve—caps his arc with visible cost: he now carries the history he once mocked. Interior contradiction could be sharper during the radio confession beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s “restlessness” is the only interior friction shown; all other emotion is abstract (“witness change without judgment”). No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, so the arc is static observation rather than tested resolve. The origami return lands as tranquil acceptance, but because no earlier tension is dramatized, the cost feels conceptual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s quiet maternal vocation registers as a consistent lifeline, but interiority is limited to soft abstracts (“mellow,” “softly adaptive”) rather than embodied contradiction; the curl hand-off is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her, so the requisite visible cost for 8+ is borderline. Leo’s trembling breath is noted but not dramatized through gesture or spoken subtext; we watch awe declared rather than witnessed. Interior language skirts therapy-speak (“nurture lifelong wonder”) and the arc leans on summary across years instead of fresh pressure. Still, the characters feel like individuals, the generational return lands, and no competence cushions real risk—enough for mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s “sacred duty” motive is declared repeatedly but never tested by an alternative desire; he drifts through discoveries without a visible fork or forfeiture. Micro-choices—tracing the dragon, activating the device—are present, yet they feel inevitable, not costly. The interior contradiction promised by “odd historian” never surfaces; he is competent, calm, unopposed. Still, the embodied emotion (“his heart beat a rhythm against the overwhelming stillness”) and tactile handling of relics keep him credibly perceptive.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s longing to escape the routine is palpable, but interiority drifts into mood-summary “she felt a deep urge” rather than body-level contradiction. The final shift from escape-to-purpose is declared, not dramatized: no on-page moment shows her renounce flight or pay cost for staying; we’re told “she no longer felt confined.” Micro-choices under pressure—slipping fortunes, watching Leo—exist, yet hinge on off-page daring rather than visible flaw-driven mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Father Elian’s interiority is rendered through ritual micro-choices—thumb in paint, pedal pressed—that externalize his contradiction between contemplative stillness and urgent intervention; the final renunciation of noise/power is earned by these visible acts, leaving a felt cost as the blue dims. No stock phrases intrude; every beat is filtered through his priest-performer lens. The lone flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-label (“to illuminate was to disarm”) that momentarily intellectualizes the embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—Elara’s synesthetic transposition of seaside humming into visual patterns is character-specific. Contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. creative urgency) coexist in-scene, but no micro-choice after the final conducting gesture shows a visible cost; the smile lands as sentiment rather than earned renunciation. The nautilus-shell-as-baton is a vivid extension of her body, yet the chronologically homesick trait is only asserted, never allowed to complicate a decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen’s contradictory desire to defy gravity while needing to surrender that defiance is dramatized in embodied beats (weightless glide vs. final grounded stance). Micro-choices—tablet tracing, leap across gap, refusal of the “eternally young” self—are legible and costly. The interior paradox is shown through action, not diagnosis. Closure renunciation is earned by the prior cycles of fragmentation and pain.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s emotional thaw is charted through tactile micro-choices (tracing the drum rim, pressing the needle into clay) that externalize her interiority without therapeutic self-labeling. The contradictory pull between nostalgic sound-memory and present silence is held in her body throughout, giving her final classroom poise credible cost. Kael’s quiet reciprocity supplies minimal but sufficient relational pressure. The only flattening is a slight over-reliance on “numbness” as a summary label in early beats; still, embodiment dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—solitude vs. need for alliance—is dramatized in the final invitation; micro-choice of sharing the bench costs her isolation and is earned by prior pigeon beat. Embodied emotion is light (pulse, steadying hands) but avoids cliché. The woman’s pressure supplies credible external test; “tall figure” memory tag is efficient. Flaw: no visible tool-use or body-failure under stress; competence feels safe, capping at 7.7.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation is lucid and personal; the prologue-style summary keeps us from seeing contradictory impulses *in scene*. Only one micro-choice—uncorking the vial—actually alters her tactical position; everything else is memory montage. That single beat earns the insight, so the arc is credible but thinly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivations are lucid and escalate credibly: the need to “feel the weave” of time coils into the discovery that the rope’s memories are the price for aiding the energy beings. Interiority is concrete—“laughed softly, a sound without mirth”—and the renunciation of his past is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choice at the spiral moment embodies the ethical-play trait and forecloses any return to his old identity. The only slack is a faint risk of epiphany-labeling in “texture of time was…a layered tapestry,” but it is immediately anchored in sensory cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief and aesthetic mission are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“magnificent simplicity”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction; the final stance is earned yet the absence of live opposition keeps pressure academic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—professionally thorough charlatan yearning for authenticity—is dramatized in the blotter-petal beat. The embodied shift from static crackle to hollow inhalation shows emotion under pressure, not labels. The final renunciation is earned by prior causal chain: synthetic joy tastes false against real sorrow → she drops the petal. Cost is visible: her livelihood tool becomes dust, yet the micro-choice hierarchy is narrow for 700-word scope and the “grotto’s gratitude” drifts toward pat personalization, keeping her just shy of 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is present—her shrewdness surfaces in brokerage recall and the micro-choice to trace the envelope—but emotions are declared (“whimsically attentive,” “joy,” “warmth”) rather than embodied. Anya remains a gentle archetype; we never see her contradictory impulses under pressure, so the friendship’s depth feels summarized. The earned change (Elara pivots from profit to people) is stated, not dramatized with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s loneliness and longing are vividly embodied; the “luminescent ache” is a lived-in sensation, not a label.  Her gesture of leaving reed gifts dramatizes the “boldly sympathetic” trait under social pressure.  The interior contradiction—yearning versus fear of rejection—survives into the final beat.  Yet the climactic shift from ache to belonging is asserted more than dramatized; we see the group hug but not the micro-choice that costs her the last vestige of outsider safety.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—free the echoes—and her gift is paid for with personal aging, a visible cost. Interiority is mostly lyric-narrative rather than concrete contradiction inside a scene; emotional shifts are announced more than embodied. The trade-off of time-for-echoes is dramatized, but the interior contradiction between illustrator patience and temporal haste is asserted rather than felt in the moment of sculpting.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly particular—his taxonomist’s need to “decode the logic behind grief and joy” is shown through tactile ritual (placing glass eyes on stone, timing drips). The contradiction between measuring loss and surrendering to mystery is embodied, not declared. Only the sister’s laughter feels lightly sketched; her absence is thematic shorthand rather than a lived wound that degrades his perception. Still, the final renunciation—accepting the “ghost in the equations”—pays visible cost by ending the obsessive calibration ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in every tactile micro-choice—probing ducts, steadying the tape—so motive stays visible without label-speak. Interior contradiction is quiet but present: he wants anonymity yet risks exposure to broadcast, a tension held in scene, not stated. The earned cost is the return to invisibility after the broadcast; the smile in the final line shows the path foreclosed with felt weight, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s shift from control-freak scientist to storm-soaked listener is credibly embodied: the uncurled fingers letting the leaf fly, the hand on wet bark in solidarity. Interiority stays concrete, not diagnostic—“she felt a part of the garden rather than its master” shows the cost of surrender without naming it. The only drag is a touch of repetitive “metamorphosis” language that slightly blurs the contradiction inside her; still, the final silence-as-acceptance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s insomnia and painter identity are vividly embodied—his sleepless trekking, brush-like tracing of rain trails—but the “wryly earnest” trait is only asserted, never shown under pressure; the final gift of a painting feels pre-planned rather than a spontaneous micro-choice revealing hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present (hope vs. cynicism) yet the amber brooch’s pull is stated, not dramatized through tactile struggle. Still, the arc from isolation to shared humanity is credible and the cost (surrender of the brooch for a story) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kaelen’s “jaded sight” and Elara’s “pure heart” are stated rather than embodied; the only embodied beat is her trembling fingers. The interior contradiction is asserted, not dramatized in scene. The final transfer of the pearl makes sense but the personal cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive to “compile fragments into meaning” drives every beat; the trumpet valve acts as an embodied contradiction—silence she must break—creating credible internal pressure. Her internal experience is rendered through concrete sensory filters (cold brass, fog, ledger odor) rather than diagnostic labels. The final choice to sound the trumpet is prepared by micro-choices (returning at dawn/dusk, sharing ink discovery) so the renunciation of silence carries visible cost: she surrenders her safe role as observer to become audible leader. Missing secondary-character crucible keeps it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s “meticulous route mapper” identity is asserted more than embodied; we see her label but few concrete micro-choices that reveal an obsessive pattern-hunter’s mind. The interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“her mind a labyrinth of paths”) without contradictory impulses under pressure, so the promised analytical artistry never complicates her tactics. Closure earns a mild renunciation—she walks away “renewed”—but the cost is poetic assertion rather than a visible forfeiture shaped by her mapper flaw. The arc is coherent, yet the character’s distinctiveness stays generic; swap “artist” or “detective” and the plot still runs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “sympathetic skeptic” trait is embodied in her tactile hesitation with the tile and her decision to act despite doubt; the interior contradiction is alive in scene. The micro-choice to transcribe rather than dismiss the glow is credible and costs her scientific detachment, paying off in the shared silence at dawn. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; solo arc suffices. Flaw-driven tension is light—doubt voiced more than tested—but the earned shift from observer to facilitator lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s boredom-driven curiosity is concrete and embodied (“dry curiosity of the eternally bored”), but interiority inches toward diagnostic label-speak (“his immortality feeling suddenly, terribly new”). Contradictory impulses—boredom vs. awe—surface only in the final paragraph, too late to complicate mid-scene choices. The earned stasis lands, yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s interior contradiction—honest son of a con man—drives every beat; the ink-pot micro-choices under mortuary pressure embody his math-of-fair-trade motive. Embodied emotion is lean but precise: “weight-a brand in this silent room” fuses shame and vocation. Final renunciation of con tricks is earned by causal chain; cost is the drained pot, signalling future emptiness. Minor: father’s biography is off-stage, so paternal flaw is told more than enacted, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s quiet obsession is credibly particular—his “textures of different times” motive, the ritualized climb, the notepad-against-arm posture all read as lived. Interior contradiction is soft but present: the scholar’s need for precision collides with the mystic leap of “refracting time.” The micro-choice to chart the hum rather than simply listen crystallizes his studious bent under pressure. Cost is muted—he gains data, loses nothing visible—but the earned endurance of solitude at dawn carries a faint stoic price that satisfies the length/scope scale.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s drive to reconstruct an erased identity is vivid and embodied; his tactile handling of the poison label and the visceral recall of arsenic’s taste show interiority without label-speak. Micro-choices—crouching between containers, deciding which fragment to trust—escalate under rising stakes. The final stance (“a past but no future”) crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost. Flaw: late-onset interiority is more summary than scene, keeping the score just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (the seashell warms, compass flickers), but her “myth-buster” identity is asserted, not dramatized—no on-page debunking act or professional reflex under pressure. The final insight is credible, yet the cost is more lyrical than embodied. Interior contradiction is present but muted; we see acceptance, not a wrenching hierarchy of values. Good, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority—“dual allegiance tore at her,” “methodically planning… trusting the gut”—shows contradictory impulses in scene, and the final graffiti raft cradling the stone earns micro-cost. Yet her emotional range stays oddly calm; no sweat-slick grip on the spray can, no tremor as corporate shadows lengthen, so embodiment under-fulfills the claimed desperation. The role of culture-shock absorber is asserted rather than dramatized through visible interaction with newcomers. Overall, credible but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s endurance in the lunar night is pinned to a single, irreversible choice—take the photograph before the drill bites. The grain of quartz functions as both talisman and metronome; each time she touches it we feel competing impulses: duty vs. despair, private grief vs. public record. No epiphany is declared; instead the final image of the grain catching new light crystallizes her earned stasis: she has outlasted the night and the loss, the cost legible in the spent vials and the crater now sunlit and doomed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s tactile synesthesia is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“felt its delicate frame and the faint vibrations of its dormant heart”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the micro-choice to release the drone is unopposed, so the arc is smooth rather than tested. Blind competence is total; no misreading of the refraction pattern jeopardizes the repair, flattening stakes. Earned cost is missing—success feels pre-assured.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s wry aside “Glaciers make poor cartographers” crystallizes a consistent, dry-witted lens that filters every perception; his silent tracing of condensation and final quiet acceptance show interior contradiction and embodied emotion without label-speak. The quest is personal, lifelong, and visibly costly when he braves the bitter air and concedes the discovery may “alter nothing.” Micro-choices—adjusting glasses, clutching the dog-eared phrasebook, murmuring self-mocking asides—form a credible chain of atlas-editor behavior that forecloses no path yet exacts a palpable weariness. Only the worry about ephemerality is named rather than dramatized, preventing the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s “infinite patience” is stated repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulse or visible cost; his interiority is lyrically sketched (“infinitely patient gaze”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The only micro-choice—striking the fork and pacing—never risks failure or forces a trade-off, so the motion feels serene rather than crucible-forged. No flaw complicates his mastery, so the characterization is evocative but flat, short of the 9-band demand for embodied contradiction and paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen’s desperate solitude and single-minded need to “harness the ephemeral” stay credible; the vial-guided micro-choices under oxygen countdown show embodied panic-over-override. Interiority is concrete (“every instinct screamed… he knew success depended on calm he did not feel”). Flaw: no visible contradiction inside the final beat—his calm feels arrived-at rather than wrestled, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lattice is the only object that constrains Kaelen’s path; his father’s “hunger for redemption” is asserted rather than dramatized, and the moment of earned stasis lacks visible body-cost. Still, contradictory impulses (guilt vs. self-preservation) thread the ascent and the final renunciation of the lattice feels character-specific. Micro-choices (whispering lies, scraping the panel) tether interiority to action; the emotional arithmetic stays just shy of 9-band because the father-son wound is told in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract (“mournful elation”); the bead-hand-off forces a single clear micro-choice, yet the ghost’s contradictory impulses stay summarized, not embodied in scene. Elian’s remembrance flood is told, not dramatized, so the cost feels declared rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyric but generically “poetic,” lacking individual tics or contradictions under pressure; her “haunting optimism” is named repeatedly yet never tested by a moment where she nearly quits or chooses against it, so the attribute feels decal rather than crucible. The sewing is continuous motion but reveals no hierarchy of values—every stitch is equally sacred, so no micro-choice escalates cost. No relationship or secondary figure applies live pressure, so the crucible is purely self-generated; because the self never splits, the arc is smooth, not jagged. Earned stasis is asserted in the final paragraph but not dramatized—she simply stands up, no visible forfeiture or even fatigue—so the cost feels notional.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “warmly curious” nature is stated repeatedly but never manifests as contradictory impulse or visible cost; her emotional arc is smooth, diagnostic, and externally narrated. Interiority drifts into tour-guide summary (“She felt the weight of interrupted journeys”) rather than embodied perception. The final peace is declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that hurts, so the renunciation feels pre-approved rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile attention to the clipboard and chalk keeps her from abstraction—but her contradictory impulses are only asserted (“need to discover meaning” vs. fear of exposure), never enacted in a moment where she almost withholds or over-reveals. The final beat is static: she mails the letter, satisfied, without an on-page cost or irreversible choice that forecloses a path. Competence dominates; no visible flaw complicates the drop. Earned stasis is implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “wise-fool” duality drives every beat: the muttered milk line dupes the captain while her needle silently re-stitches power. Interiority stays concrete—blood on thread, flame reflected in silver—never sliding into label-speak. The final renunciation (extinguishing the Eternal Flame) is earned because her earlier sightings of guard-complicity have foreclosed every safer path. Cost is visible: she accepts irreversible darkness in exchange for the kingdom’s last chance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and consistently medium-specific; the contradictory impulses—yearning for Kaelen’s apology while fearing its arrival—pressure every beat. The unsent letters function as concrete internal props that visibly rustle and dissolve, giving the forgiveness arc a felt cost. Micro-choices (tightening grip on the shard, releasing the letters) track her hierarchy of values without tidy emotional arithmetic. The only bar to 9.0 is that the final renunciation is slightly over-articulated (“she chose forgiveness, not for him, but for herself”), edging toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—coral weight, anesthetic haze, Kaito’s cast—yet the “shrewdly innocent” paradox is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice visibly risks her innocence or shrewdness, so the final catharsis feels lightly earned rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear but interiority slips into label-speak (“pensive mirth”) and generic therapy-speak (“the joy was not lost, merely waiting”). Only one embodied micro-choice—placing the fragment—drives change; the rest is observation. No contradictory impulse under pressure; emotional arc is tidy rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s shift from restorer to reawakener is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—prying, tapping, tossing the coin—each one shedding a little more certainty. The interior contradiction between her need for control and her growing surrender to curiosity is embodied, not labeled. Cost is visible when she lets the coin vanish, relinquishing expert mastery for perpetual wonder. Flaw compounded: her playful precision nearly stalls the moment she hesitates to toss the coin, showing genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s defiance is vivid—“shook the gourd rattle seed fiercely” shows embodied resistance—yet her interior contradiction (scholar vs. outlaw) stays summary, never splitting her in-scene under scanner-fire; the spark is felt, not fracturing her. Micro-choices scatter seeds, but we don’t see her weigh immediate physical risk vs. coded failure; stakes rise, hierarchy of values stays inferred. Closure earns endurance with cost—“ready for the next garden”—but the moment of renunciation is more posture than pained fork. Still, voice, gesture, and cryptic diction individualize her above archetype; competent struggle is present, just shy of visible flaw-compounded mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush, specific to the “insomniac poet”: his trembling hand, pearlescent eye-tracks, the act of ensconcing. Contradictory impulses (shy vs. unstoppable) are asserted but not dramatized in a single visible beat; they stay parallel rather than colliding under pressure. The centuries-long endurance earns a final renunciation (“last pain into beauty”) with conceptual cost, satisfying the closure gate. Voice remains coherent but leans on lyrical assertion over bodily micro-choice in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s caretaker identity is embodied through ritualistic tending of glass orchids and the chime-crack crisis, giving her a tactile, lived-in vocation. “Foxglove regret” supplies a distinct emotional flavor, yet interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“her existence was a gently systematic ritual…”) rather than contradiction under pressure; we never see her want anything that might fail. The final beat—returning to the orchids—renders a credible Earned Stasis, but the lack of an opposing want or palpable fear flattens the motivational gradient, keeping the arc competent rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—terrified of failure yet driven to risk everything—pulses in every micro-choice (dipping the quill, trembling hand). The embodied cost of her “carefully reckless” trait is visible: each vow physically brightens the scroll and tightens the archive’s air, making her eventual forgiveness feel earned rather than declared. Kaelen remains off-page until the final beat, so relationship-as-crucible is implied, not dramatized; the arc is solo but complete. The −0.4 reflects that his absence limits status-dynamic pressure until the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire to “harmonize conflicting values” is declared repeatedly but never dramatized—no councilor or historian appears, so the crucible is purely internal. Her micro-choices (scraping glue, whispering to stone) are tactile and specific, yet the emotional cost is abstract: we’re told she feels “quiet joy” rather than shown what concrete option she forfeits. The inherited chain and decrypted message supply warm back-story, but they don’t complicate her present-tense motives or force a visible mistake; competence dominates over flaw. Closure earns a mid-band because the final stance is legible and kind, but the absence of external resistance keeps the pressure—and thus the characterization—below elite intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s guarded interiority and incremental trust are credibly embodied; the moment she “broke down” still reads summary rather than scene, muting the cost of her confession. Micro-choices under pressure (encoding songs, handing over the chip) are present but spaced thinly across the montage, so the hierarchy of values feels declared more than dramatized. The pigeons and chip act as externalized organs of motive, keeping the arc legible, yet the emotional peak is paraphrased, not lived at sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rich (“featherly determined”) and her motive (decode sacred thresholds) stays constant, but she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; the crossing of the luminous threshold is passive revelation, not active renunciation. The “lost child” premise is emotionally asserted rather than dramatized, so the promised contradiction between abandonment and filial duty remains off-stage. Because no micro-choice forecloses a path, the arc reads as atmospheric epiphany rather than character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—her fingers on the brittle feather, the pocket-warmth at the end—but motivation stays abstract (“rhythm of belonging” is repeated, not tested). No contradictory impulse in scene; she drifts from observation to observation without a micro-choice that costs her anything. The single significant change is the realization that belonging is relational, but it is narrated as uplift, not wrested from a renounced alternative. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and occupation-specific, keeping the score in the solid mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s curiosity about vanishing paths stays sharp, but his interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“cheerful gloom,” “sea-foam recollectionist”) that tells us mood rather than showing contradiction in scene. No micro-choice under pressure crystallizes his hierarchy of values; the crater glass simply shows him things instead of forcing a forked decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s desire to “serenade monotony” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical self-explanation (“she felt the weight…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The bishop piece reappears, yet never once constrains or complicates a live choice; it’s a passive talisman. Because no other character applies pressure, the arc is a solo mood-loop rather than a crucible. The ending’s “quiet revolution” is declared, not dramatized—no cost is extracted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remember versus the ban’s danger—are sketched more than dramatized; the cosmic-verse motive is vivid, yet her micro-choices under pain are summarized (“agonizing yet exquisite”) rather than shown, keeping the interior cost at arm’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her “calloused fingers,” “noctilucent reckonings,” and habit of pocketing a shore-pebble all individuate her. Yet the story keeps her in pure reflection; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is dramatized under pressure. The final smile is unmotivated by any on-page cost or forfeiture, so the arc feels observational rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—“scars…tingled,” “calloused fingers”—but the motivation to “translate pain into a universal language” is declared repeatedly rather than dramatized; no micro-choice on this walk tests or alters that goal, so the drive stays static. The porcelain box and pine-cone function as memory triggers, yet her handling of them never forces a present-tense decision or visible trade-off; the moment of “enlightenment” is purely reflective. Earned stasis is credible—she closes the box and descends lighter—but the cost is emotional summary, not an action that forecloses a path. Character remains vivid and consistent; just missing a pressured turn that would prove motive under fire.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the cracked yet glowing box reweights the premise—fracture coexists with beauty—so Resonant Reconfiguration is achieved with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of celestial mirroring and repeated ridge walks teaches itself early and holds. No causal reversal, but a single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this lens. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“moonlit ridge path”), well within the 120-word allowance. One scaffold loop (“hard softness” repeated four times) slightly dulls the final beat, preventing the 9-band.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge path is more than postcard: it supplies the literal edge between forest and sky, mirrors her internal border between scarred and whole, and constrains her pace—she must walk carefully on gravel, box in hand. Micro-setting also includes her own body (scars as sensor) and the porcelain box whose cool surface counters night air, guiding her grip. Celestial slow-dance imagery returns to rewire the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only reason not 9+ is the lack of a tactical choice forced by terrain—path never narrows, branches, or threatens drop.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—transform personal agony into shared language—stays abstract; no external or internal obstacle escalates during the walk. Pressure is atmospheric (stars, cold) rather than option-narrowing; coincidence is absent but so is causality. One soft tightening: she closes the lid and “heart lighter” signals a micro-shift, yet no visible price is paid or path foreclosed. Meets the single-deepening allowance for Accumulative lens but stays at low-band because the cost is conceptual, not felt on the page.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges through iterated imagery—cracks holding light, scars still sensing—rather than any statement; the closing glow re-prices fragility as strength. Subtext is embedded in gesture (tracing fissures, cradling pine-cone) and silence; no moral is pronounced. Ambiguity is preserved: enlightenment is not cure but acceptance. Only slack is the repetitive articulation of “universal language,” which edges toward thesis rather than lived paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically layered (“logical dreamer,” “lucidly watchful”), but her contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized in a single high-pressure beat; no moment forces her to choose between logic and dream with visible cost. The pearl placement is presented as inevitable perfection rather than a gamble that could fail, so the Earned Stasis feels preordained, not authentically struggled for.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured (“the weight of silent histories in every stone”), but her agency is mostly receptive—she kneels, reads, senses—rather than decisive. The “burden of legacy” is absorbed more than contested; no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path until the final sentence, and even that isassertive, not dramatized. Sensory embodiment is strong, yet emotional contradiction is absent; she never hesitates or misreads an echo, so pressure never tests perceptual limits. The closure renunciation carries conceptual cost, but the causal chain is retrospective summary, not enacted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Interiority is atmospheric but generic; “borrowed heartbeat” remains abstract, never embodied in a concrete micro-choice that costs her. She observes and hums, but the mirrors’ rippling feels like external magic rather than driven by visible, risky trade-offs. No contradictory impulse or flawed blind-spot surfaces, so the climax is graceful but unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her bare feet on warm stone, the clipboard’s cool weight—but the “operatively gentle” trait is stated more than dramatized; we see nods and soft chant, yet no contradictory impulse that would let gentleness cost her something in-scene. The self-sacrifice is foreshadowed early, so her fade feels earned, but the emotional layering is smooth rather than jagged; she never surprises us or herself. Secondary characters remain silhouettes, so the relational crucible is thin; still, in a single-POV vignette this is acceptable. Overall, a credible arc of renunciation, but the absence of visible flaw-driven mistakes keeps her just shy of high-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vane’s contradictory impulses—ruthless water theft vs. reverence for an extinct song—are dramatized in the kneel-and-release beat, the egg’s weight against his knee-salt crunch embodying cost. Interiority stays concrete (“his amoral nature argued…his heart insisted”) without therapy-speak. The endurance/renunciation is earned: the drought he engineered becomes the very map that lets him free the echo, so the flaw structures the payoff. Voice remains singular; no secondary character pressure is needed or on page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—chastity against insurgence—is dramatized in each micro-choice; the courtesan label is shown through her practiced stillness, not told. The “final, decisive pull” on the obedience-thread visibly forfeits her citadel safety, earning her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s calm, reflective interiority is consistent and embodied; the ‘uncommonly serene’ trait visibly governs her reaction to Marco’s threat and her pivot to hope. Yet the arc is more announced than dramatized—we are told she “decided to reverse her typical narrative arc” rather than watching that decision spark under fresh pressure. The serenity therefore stays surface-calm, never cracks, and no contradictory impulse is allowed to complicate her; cost is declared (“story stick felt lighter”) rather than shown through a beat that hurts. Still, the occupation, tools, and ethical motive intertwine cleanly and individuate her above the median.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s collector-of-vanishing-things identity is vivid; the moth-wing knot ritual dramatizes his esoteric realism under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“heart ached with the weight of this final pilgrimage”), avoiding label-speak. The final untying is a micro-choice that visibly costs him the last anchor, earning his transient rootedness. Missing a second on-page contradiction to push him past 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is legible and consistent; her gentle, reverent handling of the rope embodies “technically gentle” and shows micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction is present—guilt vs. ardor—but remains generalized (“a weight lifted,” “snowmelt ardor”) rather than enacted through idiosyncratic thought or bodily specificity. The decisive change—braiding the names alive—is earned, yet the cost feels abstract because the narrative never risks her physically or socially. Still, the arc coheres and her craft roots every action.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Contradictory impulses (past/future sight) are dramatized in the dream-interpretation beats; the final renunciation—stepping into the storm as “part of the flow”—is earned by the seal-dissolution beat that forecloses her keeper role. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“grit etching lines beside her eyes”). No second character, so status crucible waived; micro-choices (stone placement, pressing seal to wall) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: directive crumbles on-page, identity as keeper lost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid—“frugality…key to seeing what others had wasted”—and embodied emotion pulses in the trembling hands. Yet the only micro-choice that costs him (aligning the tile) is executed without visible alternative or flaw-exposed struggle, so the renunciation feels slightly under-priced.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara's "scheming pacifist" trait is asserted rather than dramatized; her manipulative ingenuity is told through abstract labels ("scheming nature satisfied") instead of sharp micro-choices. Kael's release of resentment is shown in a single tear/smile beat that feels abrupt because the script never lets us watch his interior contradiction unfold in real time; the emotional pivot is declared, not earned. Interiority relies on therapeutic abstractions ("cellular memory," "shifting grace") that flatten embodied specificity. The broken-pin cylinder reappears as a prop but does not force a visible tactical cost from either character, so the crucible never actually bites.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s obsession with the crystalline peaks is vivid, but his interiority toggles between poetic labels (“runaway dream”) and embodied urgency without contradiction being dramatized. Lyra stays calm accessory; no contradictory impulse or status pressure is granted to her. The micro-choice to breathe in sync is the only visible cost/anchor; the final mirror-holding reads as triumph, not renunciation, so the promised “earned stasis” feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s feisty stubbornness is shown through her solitary cathedral labor and the micro-choice to craft “eyes that see hidden truths,” but the interiority drifts toward paraphrase (“she realized…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The mother–daughter rift is sketched more in summary than in scene, so the final embrace feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than hard-won. Still, her persistence tracks cleanly from exile to altar offering.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “cold star” of curiosity and the flutter of “wonder and dread” are embodied—but the contradictory impulses never clash in a single beat; the renunciation at the end is signaled rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels more observed than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s linguist identity is shown decoding the diary, but interiority stays generic (“she remained calmly resourceful”). Kael’s panic is declared, not embodied. The final renunciation—accepting the library’s echo inside her—arrives without prior contradiction or visible cost, so the beat feels tagged on rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—patchwork identity, bodily memory of the carousel horse—but the chimera twin remains abstract; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. The final “herself, whole and aberrant” is declared, not earned by a visible choice that costs her anything. Reflection blocks >20 % yet anchored to present cues, so BRR waived. Voice is consistent, but motivation flattens because the garden never tests her with an either-or.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each narrative thread thickens the fog and the card’s glow, reweighting the stake toward self-acceptance. Closure is a Charged Poise—tapestry of light/sound—whose cost is felt (“trapped freedom”), but the tightening is only one cadence shift; no persistent constraint shapes tactics earlier. Orientation clear by line 5; no penalty. The lens ambiguity at midpoint is waived because closure teaches the pattern.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Peeling carousel horse, damp deck, fog that thickens with each memory—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s alienation. The emerald card as micro-setting constrains her attention and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Weather directly limits visibility and forces inward focus, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “translate confusion into clarity” drive is concrete from the first beat and every micro-choice—pressing the seal into the braid, re-knotting the rope—ratchets that motive under palpable risk. The interior contradiction between scholarly control and ontological dread is embodied in her trembling fingers “thick with age,” not stated. Cost is legible: she trades the rope’s neutral history for a singular, irreversible graft of the diplomat’s purpose, foreclosing any return to the archive’s safe taxonomy. Only the diplomat’s ghostly gaze feels slightly convenient; his acknowledgment is the sole moment where motive tilts toward gift rather than earned synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is tactile—stone warmth, fingertip ice-reading—showing contradictory impulses (preserve old song vs weave alien vibration). The earned renunciation—she walks away leaving the stone—carries visible fatigue cost. Minor slip: “hammered repose” abstracts the climax instead of letting body register it.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—needing coincidences to mean something yet fearing they might not—remains embodied in her trembling fingers on the shard. Micro-choices (angling each fragment while retrocognitive flashes sear her temples) enact a visible cost: blood on silica, breath held until the beam blooms. The ending credibly crystallizes her renunciation of randomness, but the story stops short of letting her flaw trip her; the cost is felt yet not compounded by an interior mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    The archivist’s “pre-emptive nostalgia” is a live, embodied contradiction that drives every beat; his micro-choice to sit on the bench and let the whispers wash over him crystallizes identity at visible cost—he forfeits solitary certainty for porous, collective self. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, never sliding into label-speak. The only drag: the off-page flood anecdote is recounted rather than dramatized, muting the emotional high-tide that could have punched harder.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s desire to “defy the gravity of hopelessness” is stated early and his ritual acts (chant, kerosene rag, mosaic reading) embody it, giving us embodied motive. Yet the interior contradiction promised by the phrasing never surfaces as a live dilemma—he never doubts, stalls, or weighs cost against private dread—so the arc is a smooth ascent rather than a crucible. The moment-to-micro-choice linkage is present (ignite rag → sparks → fortress blooms) but the emotional stakes stay flat because we see no flaw or risk that could actually fail. Earned change is suggested in the final smile, but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal, so the arc feels winsome rather than wounding.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “warmly observant” trait is shown through her tactile attention to crabs and strata; her motive—discover the texture of time—drives every micro-choice. Internal contradiction is light but present: she studies periphery to avoid direct confrontation yet knows avoidance itself is part of transition. The final stance—transform, not abandon—costs her the safety of Kael’s stasis, and the cicada return seals it. Voice convergence under stress is minimal; both speakers keep distinct cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and silence-cataloguing obsession are vivid, embodied, and drive every beat; the porcelain doll warms in her palm, a tactile anchor. The final renunciation—returning to the bunker with the vial—pays the cost of her fear yet feels inevitable. The contradiction between agoraphobic terror and the need for sky-quiet is held in scene, not summarised. Only the father remains off-page, so status dynamics and secondary-pressure bullets are N/A; no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is consistently “fluidly logical,” but the trait is asserted more than dramatized; her only micro-choice is the soft hum, which is too gentle to crystallize a hierarchy of values or visible cost. No contradictory impulse is shown in scene, so the silence-teaching motive feels monochrome rather than tested. The ending’s “deep satisfaction” is told, not embodied, keeping the arc shy of earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “wisely adventurous” trait is announced, not embodied; her only risky beat (entering the dark passage) is glossed in a single clause. Interiority is stock (“heart heavy,” “heart pounding”) and never contradicts itself. The ruby flake acts as external GPS, so discovery feels handed to her; no micro-choice shows balanced competence and fear. Earned stasis is missing because the coronation costs nothing—no renunciation, no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper’s motivation is arresting—teaching suffocation to breathe—but interiority slips into thesis-statements (“This was the lesson:…”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. His single on-page decision—to allow the encroachment by hovering a hand near the ring—does carry cost and changes the relationship state from solitude to shared breath, so the arc lands. Yet we never feel his body under pressure; emotional embodiment stays abstract (“loaded emptiness,” “hollowed look”) and the epiphany arrives pre-interpreted. Sufficient for a tight 700-word arc, but not quite vivid enough to hit the 7.4+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Leo’s pyramid-scheme past is credible via the bolt talisman, but interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“he visualized his past…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The diamond payoff is foreshadowed, yet the internal stakes hinge on a single, tidy epiphany rather than a visible flaw that compounds. No secondary character pressure; Dr. Aris is a plot mouthpiece. Micro-choices exist (volunteering, lifting the bolt) but they’re linear, not contradictory under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dynastic-ender persona is a strong hook, but interiority never cracks beyond abstract “muse” and “truth.” His only embodied beat is winding the crank; the rest is narrated emotion. The final shift from destroyer to healer is declared, not dramatized, so the cost feels soft.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Alaric’s “withdrawn” trait is asserted but never contradicted or pressured; he moves from isolation to isolation without relational crucible. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“shivering bliss,” “endless night”) instead of embodied contradiction. The final “unsnapping doubts” is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice shows cost. Motivation stays static—he wants possibility, he gets possibility—so no flaw complicates the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is grounded in tactile detail (fingers on brass, dust veils), and her broken-hearted archivist identity is shown through method—sorting, cross-referencing, displaying—not label. The final choice to exhibit the button is earned, but the micro-turns inside the file room are low-stakes; we see tenderness, not contradictory impulse under fire. Emotional cost is present yet diffuse, capping the arc below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s quiet-archivist persona is sketched economically, but interior contradiction is asserted (“underestimated rebel”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The key-driven actions are coherent, yet no micro-choice under live pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—the plan unspools too smoothly. Emotional embodiment stays at arm’s length; we are told he “felt desperation creeping in,” but the body never betrays him. Closure is a narrated victory, not an on-page renunciation with visible cost, so the arc feels administratively complete rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s motive—silencing a light-born prophecy—arrives as premise, not interior dilemma; we watch ritual, not testing. The single memory of his teacher is too brief to complicate his stance, so the final renunciation carries no visible cost on him. Still, his attention to “negative space” as a weapon gives him a specialized, credible competence. Because the prophecy’s threat stays abstract, the stakes never pierce his emotional armor, capping depth at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s “orderly” trait is announced repeatedly but never tested—she never confronts disorder, makes no error, sacrifices no comfort. The “transformation” is asserted (“emerged transformed always”) without interior contradiction or embodied cost; she simply feels “profound shift” then “unwavering joy.” No micro-choice visibly forecloses a path; the arc is emotional summary rather than dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—fixing clocks yet fearing time’s chaos—stays vivid in embodied beats (grimy fingers on brass, pulse syncing with thunder). The “uncertainly certain” trait governs her micro-choice to abandon maps and kneel for the key, a credible tilt that costs her the safety of order. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (faded sketch, sailor’s ramble) and alters her next move on the page. Closure lacks a visible relational cost—no broken client bond or lost income—so the change reads as insight more than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—“luminous regret,” “weight of a name she could not properly define”—and her micro-choice to fracture the coin to force meaning is a sharp embodied risk. Flaw: the kintsugi epiphany drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“she understood…”) rather than a grittier, body-bound realization, nudging her below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “modestly fearless” stance is asserted repeatedly but never tested in a way that costs her anything; she absorbs Lyra’s pain without visible strain or contradiction, so the trait feels decal. The only micro-choice—asking for a joyful memory—arrives late and is immediately rewarded, so no internal hierarchy of values is forced. Because the central action succeeds on first attempt, her competence never collides with a credible limit, flattening arc to vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and body-specific (“every fiber…screamed with the precise coordinates of its own suffering”), but the epiphany—“mercy was the interruption of a cycle”—is announced rather than dramatized with a visible cost. The strap-find supplies a data point, yet Kaelen’s shift to certainty feels abrupt; the prior beats show retreat into math, not an enacted test of mercy. Still, his flinch-to-calculation pattern is coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract—“intuition flaring,” “heart swelled with urgency”—and lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice visibly risks or costs her anything; the unfastening happens to her, not through a wrenching decision. The anchoring objects are evocative yet function as talismans rather than tools that constrain action. She ends where she began: motivated, intact, un-scarred—an earned stasis without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.9)
    Leo’s “weightless burden” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as contradictory impulse; interiority drifts into abstract labels (“quiet pride”) instead of embodied cost. No micro-choice after the mainspring find shows him weighing risk or refusal; he simply proceeds up the ladder. The ghosts’ release feels donated rather than earned by a visible decision that costs him anything.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s monomaniacal drive to “compress eternity into a moment” is crisp, and her micro-choice to uncork the whisper is embodied (cold glass, visible ripple). Interiority stays concrete—frost patterns read as code, not metaphor sludge. The final renunciation—accepting ungovernable chaos—carries cost, though the pivot from ambition to caretaker feels telescoped; one more beat of visible regret would have pushed this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “burnished sorrow” and failed-revolutionary backstory give her a believable interior contradiction, but the text tells us her motives more than it dramatizes them under pressure; only one micro-choice—uncovering the mirror—carries visible cost, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s desire to “reclaim the light stolen by midnight” is stated early and colors every beat, but interiority stays generic (“wiping his brow” rather than a concrete contradiction under stress). The micro-choice to coax truth from the townsman is the sole on-page hinge we see; everything else is summary. No credible flaw or misbelief compounds; he succeeds exactly as planned, so the closure feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Stakes rise only in the abstract (“world hung in the balance”) with no personal cost to Elian beyond momentary gear tarnish.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—collector of measurable scent seeking the immeasurable—drives every beat; the compass relinquishment is a believable, costly renunciation. Psychometry micro-choices (“wave … clarity”) visibly tilt her stance toward surrender. Flaw: the factory-silence cue is used twice for the same emotional beat, a minor redundancy that keeps her from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—hunger for external tech guidance vs. surrender to ancestral instruction—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (letting the slide steer her chisel, palms bleeding). The conclusive renunciation of the revived GPS shows visible cost and earns its place in the causal chain; her flaw (dependency on outside navigation) is accepted, not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s quiet drive is repeatedly named but only once dramatized—she walks to the cathedral—so the attribute feels asserted rather than tested. Interiority drifts toward lyrical abstraction (“reckoned with the silence of her own heart”) that could belong to any sensitive artist. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her choices; she glides from curiosity to comprehension without friction. The closure image is lovely but arrives as revelation bestowed, not decision earned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is strong—Elara’s solemn duty and the visceral cost of bearing painful truth land cleanly. The flaw: her one on-page choice (decoding) is causally foreshadowed but not visibly paid for; no endurance or forfeiture is dramatized, so the “change” feels more revelation than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete—“amber bottle felt heavy,” “closing his eyes to focus”—and his renunciation of nostalgia is embodied in micro-choices (salvaging wood, teaching settlers). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: he stations the unopened bottle in the square, foreclosing the wish-path forever. Missing only a second contradictory impulse in-scene to reach 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s interiority is textured through the phonograph ritual and the childhood memory key, but the moment of discovery lacks a visible, embodied cost; the “velvet disquiet” is named rather than felt in trembling breath or a dropped cylinder, so the final vow reads as thought rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority (“to discover the texture of borrowed time”) is vivid and embodied, but the vortex inheritance and oak cap arrive as inherited labels; we see no prior flaw or contradiction that this moment tests, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Still, her tactile seed choreography and the silk/stone image show a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized through micro-choices—ignoring the siren lever, trusting her data, pulling the bell—but interiority lapses into summary (“quiet satisfaction”) and the single, low-stakes decision keeps the cost theoretical rather than visceral. The character change is legible yet modest; the absence of any contradictory impulse on the page prevents the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s quiet interiority is consistent and specific—his tactile handling of the glass shard, his nightly tracing ritual, his felt smallness beneath the dome all embody a believable cosmic-lonely psyche. The final crystallization—“endings could be beautiful”—is earned by the iterated empathetic star-watching and the glass’s warming pulse, so the renunciation of despair carries visible cost. Yet the story never lets him make a true micro-choice that risks anything concrete (no job threatened, no offer refused), so the arc is observational rather than crucible-forged; the empathy stays emotional, not tactical. Still, within lyrical mode the interior contradiction (“yearning vs. accepted solitude”) remains active in scene and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.7)
    The recluse’s tranquilly-perceptive nature is shown through steady observation rather than interior contradiction; the only micro-choice—opening the box—feels externally orchestrated by ghosts, so agency and visible cost land softly. Emotional embodiment is evocative (“heart pounding against ribs”) but remains one-note wonder, never complicated by fear or resistance that would foreclose a path. The arc is observation → acceptance → caretaking, a credible endurance, yet the absence of a wrong or risky option keeps the stakes internal and static.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s desire to “feel the weave of time” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—longing to measure vs. longing to experience—stays verbal; no single micro-choice under pressure dramatizes the clash. The urn fragment focuses her, yet the decisive turn (sharing the equation with Leo) is summarized, not embodied, so the cost is announced rather than felt. Secondary pressure from Leo is clean, but his descent-from-mathematician beat is delivered as exposition, muting status shift. Closure earns a Charged Poise, but the emotional price is gestural (“etched into her consciousness”), not corporal, capping renunciation at 7-plus band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“he remembered his core concept”) rather than embodied contradiction. The child functions as a mirror, not a crucible, so no relationship pressure alters his stance. The final smile feels earned yet costless—no path is foreclosed—so the arc stays pleasant, not pivotal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “brazen calm” is consistently embodied in her steady hands, unhurried documentation, and whispered negotiations with stone; the diary functions as an extension of her mind, grounding every micro-choice. Interior contradiction is minimal—her serenity never cracks, so the arc is less about change than about enduring stance, which the text renders as credible renunciation. The copper ritual is the only visible tactic; its repetitions risk procedural flattening, yet each loop tightens the lattice of costless time she spends. Cost is conceptual—her life, not the orchard—so the emotional price feels abstract, keeping her just shy of the 9-band where embodied flaw and felt loss must coalesce.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism and academic rebelliousness are shown through her decision to stage a solo “artificial pilgrimage,” an active, risky micro-choice that drives every step. Interiority is concrete—her doubt “glows” on her skin, linking physiology to worldview without diagnostic labels. The final realization that “home was not a place but a chemical memory” is earned by the causality of the amber experiment, not an unearned epiphany. Cost is present but quiet: she exits alone, footprints now mingled with the anonymous others—her skepticism is validated yet solitude reaffirmed, a credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coachman’s motive—gardening the battlefield—stays clear, but his interiority lists rather than embodies; “he thought” and “he remembered” keep emotion at arm’s length. Micro-choices (crushing pods, scattering) are present yet fail to reveal fresh contradiction; the same calm gentleness repeats beat-to-beat, so pressure never complicates his stance. No flaw or blind spot surfaces, so the ending feels inevitable, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Baron’s ache to “translate distance into closeness” is felt through the waxed leaf and the cylinder, but the interior contradiction—tracker of corpses now tracking spirit—is only asserted, never dramatized in a micro-choice that hurts. The trembling hand is emblematic: a single bodily cue, not an escalating, contradictory impulse under pressure. Closure earns a quiet renunciation (he walks away), yet the cost is more stated than lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s solitude, ancestral craft, and sudden pivot to star-chasing build a credible arc; the “blessed pariah” identity is asserted rather than dramatized, so status pressure never tests him in scene. Interiority is concrete—compass rose warmth, stylus urgency—but the shutdown’s emotional cost is told more than embodied. Final choice is earned by family custom and star fixation; still, the absence of any live opposition keeps the crucible cool.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s “chivalrous thief” paradox is alive in every beat: he bows before swapping stolen starlight, treats mortal peril as a “reverent game,” and pays with a secret now inside him. Interiority is concrete—his heart is “full of purpose,” his grin surfaces under cosmic repair—never abstract therapy-speak. The white queen he keeps is the visible cost that forecloses future innocence, earned by prior causality. Only minor slip: the guardian is a silent prop, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, keeping score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s survivor-guilt engine is palpable; the “benevolently ruthless” trait shows in her willingness to destroy illusions, not merely label them. Interiority stays concrete—finger on chessboard edge, pulse of penumbra—rather than abstract. The forgiveness turn is earned because the text has dramatized her self-interrogation through the walking-code; cost is the release of her own story into the echoing void. Still, the shift from historian-observer to self-forgiver is compressed into a single clause; a sliver more embodied resistance would push it past 8.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific to Elara’s perceptual world; “the mercury-glass showed her reflections of possible futures” dramatizes thought without label-speak. Contradictory impulses—fleeing memory yet hungering for connection—co-exist in the same beats, giving credible tension. The final renunciation of substituted realities is earned by iterative, visibly costly nightly sessions; the feather-as-bridge makes the turn legible. Voice stays consistent, but the emotional crescendo leans on repeated abstract nouns (“acceptance,” “truth”) that slightly dilute embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s self-loathing and need for absolution are viscerally embodied in his finger-fidgets and the way he treats the platinum labyrinth as both scourge and talisman. The interior contradiction—pride in his old mastery vs. the humility the tapestry forces on him—survives the reflective mode and culminates in the micro-choice to leave both labyrinth and tapestry behind. The cost is quiet but legible: he renounces the village, the only place that will ever forgive him, to carry an unshowable wisdom forward. Felt cost and earned renunciation meet the 9- gate even though the prose occasionally over-labels his emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “innocently mischievous” trait is repeatedly embodied—her smile mid-ritual, the deliberate multiplication of meanings—so motive stays particularized. Interiority remains filtered through artistic perception (“truth, like light, should be splintered”) without therapy-speak. Contradictory impulse is shown once: she mocks solemnity yet reveres the ritual’s weight, visible when she recites the spire poem while clutching the cost. The final stance (accepting many paths to forgiveness) is earned by the prior cascade of refracted poems; cost is legible in the listeners’ tear-stained, multiplied truths.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s lone, obsessive motive is vivid and embodied (“lungs screamed… acid stung”), but the interior contradiction promised in the kintsugi concept never surfaces as a live dilemma; he simply succeeds. Micro-choices are present but lack a visible trade-off or renunciation that would foreclose an alternate path. The final collapse is earned exhaustion, yet no character flaw or blind spot complicates the victory, keeping the arc just shy of high-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s nostalgic avoidance is credibly embodied (the slow dip of the brush, the unpainted shell in her satchel), and the final renunciation—placing the childhood shell back on the rock—pays the “hidden promise” with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic summary (“she saw that her nostalgia had been a cage”), muting contradictory impulses at the precise beat where they should clash. Still, her flaws drive the misstep and the later release, giving the arc credible shape.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet, embodied determination is vivid; the “screaming tenderness” contradiction breathes. Motive (“whispers > shouts”) is stated early and re-energized at every stair-step, culminating in the cork’s hum. Interiority stays sensory—cool glass, warming cork—never drifting into label-speak. The earned echo she feels supplies the required cost, sealing a credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—mending vs. confronting—drives every beat; the bronze foot’s pull against her grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices. The final “Listen” renunciation is earned by the linear assembly of soldered memory-wires. Flaw: “geography of loss” drifts toward label-speak twice, muting embodied ache. Still, her patchwork competence balances believable struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s rational truffle-forager identity is vividly embodied—she calculates risk while clutching earthy truffles, and her scientific discipline collides with desperate mysticism when she rigs copper wire to lightning. The interior contradiction is present in scene: logic versus viral compulsion, each pressure visible in micro-choices (charging the eye, reciting ash-like words). Change is earned: the glass eye dulls, silence lands, and she immediately plans the next forage—proof the occlusion works and the old self survives. Cost is felt: the charged hush is “fragile,” the price “unknown,” a constraint that forecloses the earlier brutal honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s lonely ritualism—talking to gulls, arranging sea-glass—never collapses into cute quirk; every oddity is tethered to the ache of isolation. The interior contradiction is quietly dramatized: he clings to a dead stranger’s silence precisely to fill his own. Micro-choices (finger tracing faded ink, pocketing the flower) accumulate into a credible renunciation: he mails away the last relic, paying with the return of solitude. The only bar to 9+ is that the alpine/sea contrast remains symbolic rather than physically constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s grief, observational habits, and reluctant hope braid cleanly; the moment he presses the chip into the wall and then *steps back* crystallizes a costly renunciation that the prior beats have earned. Interiority stays concrete—maps, ants, fungi light—never drifting into therapeutic labels. The only slip is a faint halo of “lonely antique dealer” trope; a single idiosyncratic twitch (humming obsolete projection names, cursing ink viscosity) would have pushed him to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to escape the crown while climbing toward a cosmic duty—stays embodied in leather-clad breath and tremoring calves. The moment she touches the liquid starlight her prior disenchantment is causally reversed: the same detachment that drove her up the ridge becomes the lens that lets her read the warning. Cost is visible: she descends aware the fireflies’ wink-out is the first installment of a debt she now carries. Minor slip: “softly commanding” is asserted twice rather than shown through cadence or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“palette of resolve” colors reacting in real time—but her contradictory impulses stay abstract; no micro-choice risks tangible loss. Kael functions as supportive mirror rather than crucible; relationship pressure is muted. Final self-revaluation is declared, not dramatized through a costly beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“jaws… shaking me like a rag doll,” “a hot spike of jealousy”), but the only micro-choice—scratching symbols onto bark—arrives late and changes nothing; no path is foreclosed, so the cost feels intellectual rather than lived. The jealousy motive is stated repeatedly yet never alters tactics mid-scene; the scroll act is cathartic, not causal. Earned stasis is gestured at but not dramatized with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scent-loss is felt through bodily details (“scentless gray”) and micro-choices (accepting the screw). The repairman remains a symbolic prop; his stillness is described but never tested. Her arc of renunciation earns a quiet cost, yet the healing shift is declared rather than dramatized in a final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete, embodied, and stakes scale cleanly to length; contradictory impulses flicker (“quill trembled… crystallize,” “desperate hope vs. fear”) and micro-choices (pouring tea, speaking the scar aloud) tilt stance. Motive stays singular and legible, but final renunciation is lightly pre-figured—felt cost arrives in the exhalation image rather than a dramatized forfeiture, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her belief in “imperfect miracles” surfaces through micro-choices (placing the bottle, switching the device) and her gritty interior voice (“Hauntings are like stuck records”). The moment she feels the archive’s atmosphere soften carries embodied cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly under-ripened, capping below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.4)
    The witness is a label, not a person: no contradiction, embodied emotion, or micro-choice ever disturbs his glide. “Spiral arbitration” and “unify” are asserted, never tested through visible risk or loss; the dictionary dissolves into light but nothing in his body or psyche registers cost. Interiority is recycled mantra (“journeying inward while walking out”) rather than character-specific thought under pressure. No flaw complicates his path; he ends exactly as he began—serene, untransformed.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shepherd’s obsession is palpable—every micro-choice (inserting the key, squinting, abandoning the backward count) is driven by the hunger to know what clocks actually measure. Interior contradiction is stitched into the ritual: control (the key) vs surrender to flux. The renunciation of counting lands as earned because the ritual has been shown to fail him; the cost is the loss of his former certainty, visible in the still key.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior contradiction is dramatized—“to understand the physics of letting go” vs. the instinct to test barriers—fueling every micro-choice. Embodied tension (quiet breath, boot silence, laser click) grounds motive; no diagnostic speak. The final renunciation—barriers soften, laser tool lightens—carries visible cost: she forfeits absolute control. Spatial gift is more label than lived tool, keeping this just under the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory filial grief and intellectual hunger are viscerally embodied (the lantern trembles when she thinks of his chalk dust). The micro-choice to keep reading the journal even as the candle gutters crystallizes her renunciation of his compulsive path with felt cost: “She extinguished the candle, knowing the light of knowledge must be handled with care.” Interiority avoids label-speak, but the final moral calculus still tilts a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo’s estrangement is stated more than dramatized; we see him listen, spin the disc, speak calm platitudes, but no contradictory impulse under pressure. The “wrong-number friendships” premise is charming yet Leo himself stays flat—no visible flaw, fear, or stake in the outcome beyond abstract mission. Elara’s grief is sketched in generic fragments (“life she was losing, love ending in silence”) and accepted without resistance; her micro-choices are off-page. Closure lands as a polite thank-you rather than a reconfiguration that costs Leo anything.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s vocation and lineage fuse into one propulsive motive; her “gently thorough” nature is shown through micro-choices (steeping the locket, sensory note-taking) rather than labels. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through archivist reflexes—time, ink, fragility—so the haunted euphoria is embodied, not named. The final endurance (leaving the doomed jetty after re-forging its covenant) costs her a literal piece of herself, satisfying the visible-cost test. The lone absence is a second on-page character to pressure status, but the self-as-crucible arc still earns its renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s brittle-joker interiority stays specific; the moon-rock hand-off shows a micro-choice hierarchy (loneliness vs. connection) with felt cost. The “desperately jocular” mask never slides into therapy-speak; her refusal to stay and bask charges the ending. Only niggle: Leo’s interior shift is reported, not dramatized, so the co-catalyst feels slightly thinner. Still, Elara’s earned stasis is vivid and proportioned to 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and character-specific; grief is embodied through dowsing rather than label-speak. The ring-warmth and bone-marrow chord give concrete micro-choices tied to her flaw/need. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—grief never fights her forward motion—so the change feels one-note. Still, the final “quiet blaze” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “confident uncertainty” is shown, not told—her trembling hand on the dry pen while composing the reply gives embodied cost. The interior contradiction—trust in method despite doubt—drives every beat and is finally accepted, not cured, earning the Resonant Reconfiguration. The heirloom pen functions as an extension of her mind: handled in setup, mid-composition, and final poise, its return reweights the mistake into dialogue. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority stays particular and avoids diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s forgotten loneliness is embodied in the weightless camera; his micro-choice to aim it at moonlit water crystallizes a believable shift from passive ache to active listener. The advisor remains a cipher—graceful hands, lunar eyes—lacking interior contradiction or visible cost, so the relationship never becomes a true crucible. Still, Elian’s final confident signing and the felt cost of the advisor’s disappearance earn a scaled, credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s transformation from arsonist to keeper is credibly anchored in tactile flashback and present mending; the “volcanic tenderness” idiom is over-toured and the internal ledger of guilt stays abstract, never quite embodied in a single micro-choice that costs him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s quiet, percussive rebellion is embodied in every beat; the drumming isn’t decoration, it’s how she metabolizes alien memories and stakes her identity. The moment she slumps forward yet keeps tapping on her own chest crystallizes a hierarchy of values—shared dream over self-preservation—at felt cost. Interiority rarely abstracts into label-speak; instead, “auroral sorrow” is lived through trembling hands and lagoon-light on skin. Flaw: no second character on-page, so status/relationship crucible untested, slightly capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “uncanny ability” is asserted rather than dramatized; the walk-recognition never fails or costs her anything, so the trait feels ornamental. Her interiority is concrete—folding the map, palming the coin—but the moment of softening Kael is told in summary (“his eyes widened… seeming to calm him”) instead of shown through micro-reactions. The final quiet triumph is earned by the story’s logic of whispers, yet the absence of any mistake or visible price keeps her just below the 8-band where genuine struggle would reside.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority stays lyrical and consistent (“spiralingly calm” anchors every beat), but the child-ghost remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is missing and the final empathy turn feels willed rather than paid for in visible cost. The dental mirror operates as an extension of her gaze, yet no contradictory impulse ever threatens her composure; she never hesitates or recalibrates, so the arc is static perfection rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is legible—quiet rebellion through chess—but her interiority stays in lyrical shorthand (“forests of second thoughts”) rather than scene-level contradiction. The magnetic chess set functions as an externalized heart, yet her handling of it is ritual, not risk; no micro-choice shows her fear of discovery or cost of failure. Because the stakes never tighten on her personally, the character arc flattens into serene confidence rather than earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—grace hidden under grime, longing caged by fear—remains concrete and embodied; the scrimshaw’s warming against her palm is a micro-choice that externalizes the tug-of-war. The final surrender is not a tidy epiphany but a visceral dissolving of the bone-key in sea-foam, making the cost of her guarded heart legible. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; her solitary stance crystallizes with earned, visible price. Voice stays particular to her dock-honed perception without lapsing into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s numb compliance and secret carving create a usable contradiction, but the piece never lets her make a micro-choice that actually changes her risk or tightens her dilemma; she only narrates and whittles. The interiority is vivid (“desiccated but still holding a form”) yet stays static, so the promised moral ambiguity never complicates action on the page. Because the ending is pure stasis—no new wager or forfeiture—the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “tremor of certainty” is named, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—he glides from observer to agent without friction. The smile at the end feels unearned because no visible flaw or cost has touched him.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s yearning for “sight” is embodied in the worn concertina he cradles; the detached reed becomes a literal barter chip that focuses his agency. The contradictory pull—wanting color yet excelling in gray-scale art—surfaces only in summary; we don’t see him wrestle with it while painting. The final renunciation (color for depth) is credible because the reed’s hum rewards his textured study of cracks and veins, paying the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is sensuous—“calloused fingers,” “golden shadows” washing her skin—yet her want stays abstract: “texture of connection” is never pinned to a memory or object she risks losing. The lab’s acoustic rules shape her micro-choices (re-angles the miner’s lens, re-tunes the crystalline bell), so agency is embodied, but the stakes plateau; no second tightening forces her to pay with time, pride, or breakage. The earned stasis at the end feels gentle rather than costly because the story never threatens her access to the sounds; the revelation lands as insight, not irrevocable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s grief is embodied through metallic heaviness and the refusal to hammer, but the interiority slips into therapeutic summary (“her hands too heavy with grief”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The micro-choice to fold and hide her own cranes is present, but the cost is reported (“she realized...”) rather than dramatized, so the final pivot feels slightly foretold rather than earned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” mind is shown only as label until the final beat; the contradictory impulses never appear in-scene. Micro-choices (unfolding the tape, turning cards) are present but low-stakes. Closure (“now a launchpad for rebirth”) is declared rather than dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. Interiority is atmospheric but generic; the voice never individuates her beyond “mystic cartographer.”

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “anguished joy” is embodied in tears and collapsing at the pagoda—but the contradiction between random movement and scholarly rigor is asserted, not dramatized. Micro-choices exist (veil-adjust, chant, collapse) yet feel choreographed rather than revealing new hierarchy of values. The cost is visible (collapse, innocence lost), but the flaw that drives her to risk madness is named, not enacted in-scene. Voice is coherent and specific; no head-count or relationship pressure to test further.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied (“hands still,” “feather-light touch”) and her contradictory impulses—punitive bitterness vs. sheltering instinct—share the same beats. The refusal to re-attach the tail is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses naive trust without sentimental therapy-speak. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of the thematic ledger near the end (“balance was found not in a scale…”), a hairline slip that keeps this just below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s scar-picking, insomnia-driven coffee-ring divination, and final acceptance of his plant-fusion wound give a coherent interior arc; the “closure seeker who only opens wounds” is dramatized, not labeled. Micro-choices (prying flagstone, urging roots) flow from the telepathic constraint. Cost is visible when he descends alone, abandoning the tower above. Motive stays character-bound; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s obsession with “unused love” is visceral, embodied in her tactile hunger for the film; her spatial imagination is more than label, guiding how she navigates the mnemonic vault. Interior contradiction is alive—she both covets and pities the sealed pain—yet the final vow to serve as conduit is a credibly renunciative stance that forecloses self-gratification. No second character on stage, so relational bullets waived; still, the solitary micro-choices (hand poised, crystal warming) reveal a hierarchy that privileges cosmic balance over personal solace. Cost is felt: she leaves the booth emptied, story transferred, paths foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—cosmic attunement versus noise overload—stays active in scene; the moment she “adjusted the orrery” and feels stardust awaken is a visible micro-choice that forecloses silence forever. The single cost is felt: once music pours out, the threat of returning silence is named, not just declared. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays coherent. Voice refrain “shadowed rapture” risks label-speak, but embodied aurora & orrery chill keep it from therapy register.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s dreamless hollowness is vividly embodied—“no visions ever took root”—and her micro-choice to diffuse through wave functions feels consistent with that vacuum. The final shift to welcoming dreams lands as earned because her prior emptiness is the very vessel that lets her charm sparks without self-interest. Cost is visible: each charm “drained her, leaving her more hollow,” so the closing peace carries a felt price. Interior contradiction is present but stays slightly abstract; a single concrete sensory spill of exhaustion would have pushed this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “stray philosopher” identity is asserted rather than dramatized; her interiority is poetic but abstract (“rediscover the wild frontier of her own mind”) without contradictory impulses in scene. The gear-handling beat shows micro-choice, yet no visible flaw or cost compounds—she succeeds too smoothly. The translocations are accepted without resistance, flattening potential internal conflict. Final unlocking feels gifted, not earned through prior mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—terror of untethering vs. hunger for self-authorship—stays alive in every beat; the star stamp brands her skin with visible cost, sealing the renunciation of the old leash. Guides stay archetypal, so relationship crucible is weak, yet their calm functions as pressure mirror. Emotional arc layers credibly: fear→vertigo→earned poise. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment vivid (“quiet hum in her blood”). End stasis earned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“his nerves tingled with new growth”), contradictions are lived (“seraphically mundane routine” vs. gilded-prison dread), and the final renunciation (“his silence was now his own”) carries earned cost. The micro-choice of fitting the bolt back is a clean, character-specific pivot. One hairline slip: the phrase “moral clarity solidifying” edges into diagnostic-speak and briefly cools the embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lorian’s patient-archivist identity is vivid, but his sole on-page choice is the final finger-snap of the rune; until then he is only writing and shelving. The text tells us his motivation is “singular and fierce,” yet we witness no interior contradiction or moment where patience falters—no risk, no visible cost to him, no embodied stress. The promised “weight of epochs” stays abstract; the only micro-choice that could have bled—the decision to mark the genealogy scroll—happens off-stage. Without a prior beat where Lorian’s resolve is tested or his body registers toll, the climactic activation feels preordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s interiority is specific—tapping as embodied coping, coral-bleach memory as ghost—and the final “mooring” is earned by the data epiphany. Yet the emotional arc is relayed more through summary than dramatized micro-choice; we’re told the weight lifts rather than watching a visible forfeiture. Still, the contradiction between ecological grief and stubborn vigilance stays credible, powering the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and stargazer identity are vividly embodied; the opera glasses function as an extension of her gaze, not just a prop. Internal contradiction is present—she feels she “doesn’t belong” yet “destined to be nowhere else,” but this tension is stated more than dramatized in micro-choices. The moment she steps into the stone circle, her motivation crystallizes, yet the beat leans on visionary summary (“visions flashed”) rather than a visible, costly act that forecloses an alternative path. The grandfather heirloom anchors her, but the emotional price of using the ancient power is implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “tracing the strange symbols” mirrors her need to “evolve tradition with intent.” Contradictory impulses (obedience vs. insurgency) ride the same beats, not alternating summaries. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she buries the fulfilled kite, accepting that her new authority means perpetual negotiation, not victory. Cap at 8.7 because the telepathy’s cost is implied rather than embodied under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s quiet competence with grafting and her ritual of whispering names into the wind are embodied, individual-specific choices that foreclose paralysis. The freeze-then-thaw arc is credible, but interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak (“the pearl of stillness within her expanded”) that dims the contradiction of grief versus growth. The photograph functions as a concrete tactile anchor, yet the stance shift in the final beat is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, her flaws and agency interlock well enough for mid-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is textured and painter-specific (“pigment and canvas,” “kaleidoscope of half-remembered smiles”). Contradictory impulses—fear of the abyss vs. need to descend—coexist in real time. The final micro-choice, sketching his own map on a forgotten book, is earned by the causal chain of tarot and memory threads. Cost is visible: he forfeits the old identity as “portrayer of surfaces.”

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—serene anger—anchors every beat; the micro-choice to step into vanishing ink is embodied, irreversible, and visibly costly. His “consciously wild” trait drives the method, not a label. No second character, so status/relationship bullets N/A. The earned stasis (return alone, knowledge won but futile) is fully motivated by prior causality. Minor slip: “serene anger” verges on diagnostic speak in one clause, but the embodied chill of the final smile keeps it above the −0.6 line.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—preservation oath vs. truth-telling—are dramatized in one continuous scene; the trembling hand on the icy terminal embodies the cost. Interiority stays concrete (“memories of vanished archivists”) rather than diagnostic. The final step away from the terminal is a credible renunciation that forecloses her former life, cost legible in the hush that now “held a promise of dawn.”

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifist resolve is stated repeatedly but never tested under pressure; she welcomes refugees and offers cuttings without internal contradiction or cost. The “senselessly perceptive” gift is label-only, never constraining or enabling a visible choice. Interiority drifts into cosmic paraphrase (“tranquil blaze,” “continuity woven”) rather than embodied emotion. Closure is gentle stasis, but because no path is foreclosed on-page, the arc feels safe, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s calm-fisher exterior is vivid, but interiority stays on the surface; the rail-spike trembles read as external cue rather than contradictory impulse. No micro-choice visibly costs him anything until the final pin, so the “earned” aspect feels light. The goddess-echo desire is declared early and recurs, yet never collides with a counter-want, keeping motivation single-note. Still, his embodied patience and zig-zag tactics differentiate him from stock archetypes.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captured lullaby stills the constellations, re-weighting the garden’s reality with undeniable conceptual cost (“the world felt whole”). Causal linkage holds—every zig-zag and voicing silence beat tightens options until the final harmonized pin. One soft spot: the rail-spike’s transliteration rules are declared but never tested by failure, so the price feels convenient. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and coherent throughout.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop; its collapsing sonic petals physically force Kael’s zig-zag path and calibrate the rail-spike’s pulses. Sensory economy is tight—audible ripples, feral lullaby, star-disruption—each detail either constrains movement or charges the final stillness. No visual filler; the garden’s rules are learned only through bodily risk. Micro-setting dominance (spike, echo ribbon) meets the 9+ gate by directly shaping the closing image.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the feral echo—is signaled in line 2 and tightens through each sonic collapse; the garden itself supplies escalating pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the constellations’ lurch forces Kael to absorb turbulence via the spike, trading calm for stability. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss (blood, tool fracture) is dramatized, capping intensity just below the 8.5 band. Agency remains steady—every zig-zag and silence voicing is protagonist-driven, not luck.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “harmonize with breakage rather than conquer it,” shown through the final fusion of Kael’s calm and the lullaby’s wildness. No character articulates the thesis; the shift from “feral” to “gentle hum” inside his chest performs the reweighting. Image-pattern—rail spike, zig-zag, voicing silence—returns charged at the end, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Resists moralizing; the reader is left to feel the new balance rather than decode a message.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter: cool, tactile, rhythmic. Synesthetic diction (“audible ripples,” “cold metal comfort”) mirrors his fisher-poet hybrid sensibility. No head-hop; spike-translations are reported as felt vibration, not explained. Compression is purposeful—“voicing silence” is taught by example, not definition—keeping lyric texture legible.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lean yet musical; sentence rhythm alternates between long breathy clauses and clipped imperative fragments that mimic sonic waves. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances setting, motion, or emotion. Figurative density is high but patterned—garden, lullaby, constellations—so it pays off rather than clutters. Only hairline slip: “patterns began to break themselves” appears twice within 30 words, a minor echo not found in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s need to “discover hidden truths” is dramatized through the concrete act of opening forbidden files; the rosewood nib anchors lineage and complicity. Interiority stays specific (“cold fury,” “absurd, to use logic to uncover a heart’s betrayal”) without label-speak. The final keystroke fuses heirloom and tablet, dramatizing renunciation with visible cost—she forecloses her inherited silence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority—her gift-turned-curse of translating infant wails—threads every tactical move; the contradiction (artist-healer who once fled) is dramatized, not declared. A visible cost is paid when she weeps while "tattooing" silence into the soundboards, yet the prose occasionally lapses into quick emotional labels (“guilt washing over her”) instead of embodied contradiction, keeping her just shy of 9-band immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her chalk-stained fingers sifting sand, her refusal to look up when challenged—but the “socially perceptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; she never actually tests or risks status. The final smile is earned, yet the cost feels ambient rather than personal—no chalk stub broken, no social capital spent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara/Aeliana’s interior contradiction—steel-armored empathy—remains embodied in every beat: the gauntlet scrape, the tessera warmth, the whispered rename. The retrocognitive trap is not a label; it forces her to kneel and touch the stone, driving the plot. The rename costs her old identity on the page, crystallizing a new stance with visible price. No other character appears, so relational bullets are N/A; single-POV interiority is specific, conflicted, and drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lush and synesthetic, giving Elara a vivid perceptual signature, but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene—she never actively hesitates or recoils mid-echo. The final “bow” is earned by accumulated longing, yet the cost feels abstract because the timeline repair is summarized, not embodied. Still, her ache is specific and consistent, and the tarot coin acts as an externalized want that keeps motives legible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Alex’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in the tension between his tender motive (recover Mara) and his methodical, self-interrogating recall; the micro-choices—picking up the geode, selecting somatic anchors, translating them into light—track a credible interior arc. The final act of packing the geode shows earned renunciation: he accepts the fragility of “willowglass hope” rather than claiming miracle. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic clichés. The only minor drag: “affectionate skeptic” is never allowed to contradict itself in live scene with Mara, so the contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—heat-mapping as lived obsession, body-lightness under fossil lift—but the “voice of the unknown” goal is stated more than pressure-tested; no contradictory want or flaw complicates the stance. The fossil-handling beats show micro-choices (aim scanner, follow glow) that credibly pivot him from observer to interpreter, yet the cost is purely epiphanic rather than a foreclosed path. Earned stasis feels willed rather than wrung. Still, the sensory-perceptual signature is strong enough to lift him into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    The hourglass turner’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “steady hands” and “mind alight” show contradiction under pressure. Motive is legible from first line and intensifies to the final image: she accepts the open-ended labor of remaking time. No secondary character appears, so crucible tests are waived; her micro-choices (opening the jar, placing the amber button) visibly foreclose the prophecy’s fixity. Cost is felt in the “new dawn” that promises unending effort—earned stasis with price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s burned-spy identity and self-appointed redemptive mission are cleanly anchored; interiority is concrete (“the silver surface worn smooth by years of covert touches”). The pillbox-handling micro-choices show hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the final smile-while-bleeding image crystallizes earned cost, yet the pivotal vouchsafe moment is slightly under-dramatized, muting the full force of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s interiority is concrete and embodied—fingers on cold metal, boots sinking in mud—while the palimpsest promise gives a layered, contradictory motive that culminates in the earned renunciation of self-forgiveness. The grandmother memory and yarn needle act as micro-choices that tilt his present stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor deduction: the “distill complexity into essence” motive is stated early but only dramatized in the final beat, so the cost is felt but not compounded across middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s calm-observer trait stays consistent, but the only micro-choice—lifting the glass and meditating—doesn’t force a trade-off or visible cost; the tears feel reported, not embodied contradiction. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; interiority is textured (“potter’s deliberate grace”) yet never truly jeopardized. The earned stasis is present thematically yet lacks a palpable price on his body or future, keeping the arc slightly under-cooked for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” lens is consistently voiced and her inherited gauge-tooth grounds her motive, yet the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“ache of loss deep in her bones”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The nightly outing is ritual, not risky; no tool-choice or mirror-angle actually fails, so the arc is circular affirmation rather than a paid cost. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and the final beat of noticing the green bud offers a micro-earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured, embodied, and pressure-tested; the “brittle awakening” motif governs micro-choices (hand on sundial, step into circle) so motives stay concrete. The decisive turn—choosing guardianship—carries visible cost (permanent library exile as living archive) and is foreshadowed by her tactile reverence for the Aetherian ghosts. Slight over-articulation of “coexist” and “translate isolation” nudges toward thesis-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her compulsion to channel others’ love while silencing her own—are dramatized in the tactile weaving of the labyrinth; the final renunciation of ghost-writing for self-expression is earned by the spiral of confessions she releases. Interiority is concrete and bird-nest specific; no stock therapy labels. The micro-choice to kneel and touch the original twig signals a visible cost: she forfeits the safe distance of anonymity. The only drag is a slight over-tidy calibration of emotion at the exact beat of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—scientific detachment vs. messianic urge to shield the town—drives every beat; the moment he bypasses the transmitter, his exhausted body micro-shivers, anchoring cost in flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are repeatedly named rather than dramatized; the only embodied panic is a single line “her claustrophobia threatened to overwhelm.” The decisive moment—drafting the harmonic blueprint—arrives via convenient organ exposition, not a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. Interiority drifts into generic lyric uplift (“she felt eternally transformed”) that abstracts rather than embodies change. The keeper’s sudden appearance erases solitary-pressure stakes, flattening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face-blindness and methodical art-making are vividly embodied; interiority stays concrete (“measured features not to remember them, but to translate”). The final realization—that the ribbon is a relationship key—earns its charge because her charcoal gaze has been anchored in sensory procedure throughout. A hairline slip: the phrase “awaken the dormant empathy” edges toward diagnostic speak, slightly flattening the cost. Still, her refusal to draw a face and choice to draw the story lands as credible renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s ancestor-fixation is vivid, but her present-tense interiority thins to label-speak (“spongey dread”) and recycled “nervously confident.” The copper-nail beats give her two decisive micro-choices that visibly cost composure, yet the station scenes still read as exposition-heavy summary rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s observant nature is repeatedly asserted but never complicates his choices; the fiddle decision feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with, so the “visible cost” test is only weakly met. Interiority is poetic but generic—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The micro-choice of angling the glass flake is vivid, yet it instantly confirms what he already suspects, muting tension. Earned stasis is present, but the emotional price is asserted (“luminous disbelief”) rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is present but drifts into explanatory summary (“he felt the old path circling back”) rather than embodied contradiction. The moment he dissuades the squatter is credible, yet the emotional cost is declared, not dramatized—no visible tremor or breath-catch to make the renunciation felt. The inherited-money motif reweights at the end, but the beat is too compressed to earn full micro-choice hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s guarded-druid trait is shown through her measured ritual actions rather than told, and her interiority stays concrete (“her emotions locked away like seeds in winter”). The micro-choice to press the carnivorous seed against the ice crystallizes her values and carries visible cost (the seed’s death, the vortex’s calm). The confession’s release does create a credible internal shift, but the prose flirts with diagnostic shorthand (“her own guardedness unbend”) that keeps this just shy of 9-band emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity is dramatized through the bleeding-palm ritual and the root-pulse she feels, giving us embodied motive; the final root-to-light transformation shows earned change. Interiority is mostly concrete (“her roots ached with the weight”), yet a few lines edge toward label-speak (“anxious elation that choked her breath”) which softens the contradiction that could have made the peak beat sharper. Still, the micro-choice to press the clipping into her chest scar directly toggling covenant history is character-specific and costly, so the arc lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—idealist vs. soul-patcher—stays vivid; the burned card and root-bone contact externalize her need. The keeper’s single line of opposition is enough to force her micro-choice of surrender, so the relationship crucible works. “Fiercely gentle” is shown twice (hand on card, settling among roots) but never complicates or costs her—no wound, no forfeiture—so the flaw stays ornamental. Cost is felt only obliquely; the final “quiet healing” is asserted, not embodied, keeping her arc just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is mostly label-speak (“hollow quiet,” “wavered about his own worth”) and loops the same emotional note; the grille-cloth micro-choice is repeated but never alters tactics. No contradictory impulse plays out in scene; the shift to music-memorabilia niche is declared, not dramatized. Earned cost is missing—failure is off-page yesterday, today he simply decides “I think I know what to do.”

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s translator-bred patience, haunted ambition, and embodied analog-searching micro-gestures fuse into a credible, singular interiority; “heart ached with haunted ambitions” risks stock label-speak yet is immediately grounded in tactile handling of the seed and pacing under magnetic hum. The final renunciation—choosing resonance over possession—pays the cost of lingering exile in the clouds, earned by iterative scene-beats of trial and error. No contradictory impulses share the stage, but the loneliness is absolute; secondary pressure is absent by design yet not missed.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s quiet, almost devotional interiority is consistent and embodied—his “wintersun serenity” feels lived-in—but the absence of visible cost or contradiction inside his own psyche keeps the arc flat. The story never tests his motivation against a real risk of failure or loss; he simply keeps working. Without a micro-choice that endangers his creed or tool, the characterization stays competent but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen is vividly interior and his emotional arc—from detached inspector to conduit of abandoned hopes—tracks clearly, with embodied beats (hesitation, tears, placing the pearl). The final renunciation of his hardened stance is earned and carries cost; his contradictory impulses are shown in the moment he both pauses at the door and reaches for the shell. Micro-choices (report vow, pocketing the shell) anchor the change. A few summary phrases edge toward label-speak, but the dominant arc stays specific.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—methodical cartographer of guilt—is vivid in her accordion hesitation and graffiti reading. The “river doesn’t blame the rock” moment externalizes self-forgiveness without therapeutic self-labeling. Micro-choice of playing the taped accordion embodies earned endurance, closing the path of silence with visible cost: the patched bellows now symbolizes resilience, not fracture. Flaws (hesitation at Blackwater) remain active, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s obsession with the Library is credibly anchored to the letter and the watch; her disciplined note-taking under reversal stress shows embodied resolve. Interiority is mostly concrete (“calculating the next move through ever-shifting paths”) but occasionally drifts into abstract labels (“cautious exuberance” repeated). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the veil functions as filter, not flaw. The final stilling of the watch supplies visible, earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—career obedience vs. green utopia—is dramatized in sweat-slick fingers and the bow-stroke that melts the violin. Telepathy grants immediate plant feedback, so every beat carries a second, silent chorus of stakes. Yet “mulberry ache” is used twice as emotional shorthand rather than fresh embodiment, and the perforated-destiny conceit is asserted, never shown as an actual handicap. Still, the final renunciation is earned: her palms go numb, the Emperor’s claim dissolves, and we feel the cost in the cold puddle left on velvet.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s kindly-decisive trait is shown twice (tending moss, carving stone) and links to the ending, but interiority lapses into “she realized” summary at the climax; the brother betrayal is told once and never complicates present choices, so the emotional engine feels thin rather than contradictory under pressure. The hairpin’s pulse is obeyed literally but doesn’t test or deepen her flaw; the final smile is earned yet cost is only asserted (“hollow ache” repeats) not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s “sincerely insincere” mask is shown through gesture (turning the shard, shifting the cloak) rather than label-speak; Elara’s micro-tremble and final firm grip embody change. Interior contradiction is dramatized: Aris feigns care while remaining detached, Elara clutches certainty then lets it fray. The cloak-transfer beat crystallizes status shift and costs (vulnerability embraced). One hairline slip: “genuinely embraced his role” flirts with exposition, but immediate embodiment rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s reverse-aging body is a vivid, embodied cost; Kael’s dissolve-reforge arc tracks cleanly from fear to re-crystalized presence. Micro-choices—closing eyes, gasp, release—are legible and drive stakes. The withheld explanation is justified by her established trait, so motivation never breaks. Only the final line’s collective “we” momentarily swerves from Kael’s interiority, softening full 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s historically reverent trait is stated repeatedly but only once—when it “honors every whisper”—does it visibly tilt a concrete present-tense choice; the interiority otherwise drifts into lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment of renunciation (standing still forever) is implied, not dramatized with felt cost, so the arc reads as elegant stasis rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s want for “sacred simplicity” is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory choice; interiority drifts toward thematic summary (“he realized…”) rather than embodied pressure. Micro-choices are limited to noticing the keystone and later kneeling—both low-cost observations. The climactic renunciation (letting the cloak fall) is graceful yet causally under-motivated; no prior beat shows why this exact gesture equals commitment. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to see sound while anchored to a repetitive job—remains vivid; the moment he pockets the key and chooses to dive is a micro-choice that actually costs him safety and forecloses the quiet life. Embodied emotion is strong: “his heart, once quiet, now beat in rhythm with the luminous vows.” Flaws (obsessive solitude, risk-prone curiosity) actively complicate the dive; the final renunciation—returning to the pier but seeing color in every flame—shows Earned Stasis with cost (he can never un-see, never stop wandering). No stock label-speak; voice stays specific to a night-working man who trusts his eyes and hands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “quiet enthusiasm” is shown through ritual coin-casting and iterative listening; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. vocation) run in parallel but don’t tighten further; final stance feels more confirmed than transformed. No second character means status/relationship bullets N/A; micro-choices visible, but cost is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses—duty vs. memory, endurance vs. release—are staged inside the continuous beam-adjustment scene; each micro-tweak of the crystal apparatus externalizes an inner trade-off. The micro-choice to let the shards settle instead of clutching them crystallizes a renunciation that costs him the tactile presence of her echo. Interiority is sensory, not diagnostic: “sorrow was a familiar weight” is anchored in the heft of brass and dust motes under his thumb. Voice never explains the renunciation; the hush in the final clause (“his heart still broken but mending”) lets the body speak the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s “brittle but earnest” interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, determined sigh, bleeding finger wiped without pause. Contradictory impulses (doubting whispers vs. naive faith) coexist in-scene, driving the final, visibly costly spell. The lukewarm-power flaw compounds believably: each fizzle tightens stakes, and the ringing success feels earned because failure was always palpable. Micro-choices (arranging shards, timing chant to dew-drip) reveal value hierarchy: cosmic balance > personal pain.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s guilt-tinged caretaker drive is concrete, but interiority tilts toward diagnostic summary (“a guilt that had shadowed him”) rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The micro-choice to follow the photo trail is present, yet the beat where he “decides to use them to create a narrative” is told, not dramatized, blunting the cost of turning private pain into public story. Because the pivotal renunciation (silence → shared voice) is off-page, the visible price feels second-hand. Still, his occupation and memory-steeped motivation are specific enough to keep characterization above the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—analytical rigor versus wonder—are dramatized in the crystal-warming beat, but the interiority drifts toward self-explanatory loft (“she knew…”) rather than raw contradiction under fire; still, the earned poise at the end carries visible cost and reconciles the split.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—fingers dancing via muscle memory while anxiety gnaws—and the parachute-buckle touch anchors contradictory impulses (survival vs. duty). The watcher’s burden is dramatized, not labeled: she forfeits sleep, improvises under wind-buffet, and the final transmission costs her solitude. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; solo arc still earns credible endurance with visible cost. Micro-choice hierarchy (tighten buckle → revise algorithm → transmit) cleanly externalizes values.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s numbness is embodied in the stillness of the dojo and his flat reaction to the jar; the merging ritual forces a micro-choice that finally fractures his detachment with felt cost. The contradictory impulses—clinging to numbness vs. craving feeling—co-exist in the same beats, not in summary. The cloned brain acts as externalized self, so every beat of handling it is a working of his interior conflict under pressure. Closure is earned: the new emotional surge is priced by the permanent loss of his protective void.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is fluid and character-specific; “storm-born silence” perceptual signature anchors Elara’s designer mind. Motivation stays consistent—guard creative space—and the seed catalyzes a believable creative pivot. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized; decision path is solitary and friction-free, so cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, the renunciation of corporate buy-out is legible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Conductor’s contradictory grief/urgency pulses in every beat; the pull-cord micro-choices (yank, adjust, cool) literalize his hierarchy of values. His flaw—knowing laughter can only return through reopened loss—drives every tactic and earns the final fade into mist. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “his eyes holding centuries of unshed tears” is performative but immediately grounded by the cord’s warming wood. One slip: “mournfully eager” is stated twice; still, the embodied contradiction is lived, not labeled, under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the library yet embracing the garden—are held in embodied, scene-level tension; the final renunciation of return is earned by the prior absorption of cold/mist. Interiority stays concrete (“pendant hums,” “ice glyphs”) rather than abstract. The flaw: no second character means status/relationship bullets are moot, so the arc is purely intra-subjective; still, micro-choices (grip pendant, step into between) carry visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s “stoically sensitive” contradiction is dramatized early—quiet endurance while feeling each failure “as a sharp, internal wound.” The moment he channels his own blood into the crucible is a micro-choice that fuses interior and external stakes. Final vivification works because every prior attempt has bled into this one; the cost is the cumulative heap of his failures. The crozier’s warmth in his palm is a haptic payoff to the frozen-bloom tone—character and object arc fuse.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “hands shaking from cold and certainty” while she re-tunes the dish shows embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to attenuate instead of amplify is a visible shift in values that forecloses the loud-signal path. Motivation stays legible but never over-articulated; the single flaw is the late, slightly abstract tag “fantasy practicality” that edges toward thesis-speak instead of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eli’s resilient optimism is embodied in steady micro-choices—tuning the radio, tilting the hourglass—so the trait steers action, not slogan. Interiority stays concrete (“jumbled and distant” memories under sideways time). Final stance costs him the grotto itself, a clean Earned Stasis. Missing is any contradictory impulse that would complicate his ardent nature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority pulses through every sentence—her attention locks onto the sinew thread, the loom, the shifting walls, and each micro-choice (keep weaving, step back, weave again) betrays a hierarchy that values pattern-control over self-preservation. The contradictory impulse is alive: she yearns to map connection yet fears the rewriting of her own past that this entails, dramatized when childhood grass becomes sinew in the same breath. Flaws complicate rather than decorate—her obsessive weaving literally erases and re-stitches her own biography, and she keeps going. Cost is visible and scaled to length: by the final image she has forfeited the stability of her own memories, accepting an “unsettling calm” as the price of authorship—an Earned Stasis that forecloses the possibility of ever again possessing a fixed past.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s vocational motive—star-navigation as existential bridge—stays coherent; the anchor-link micro-choices (pocket-fiddle, lecture prop) externalize her internal contradiction (depth vs sky). Student Kael’s shift from blank stare to questions dramatizes her influence, but his interior remains a cipher; relationship crucible therefore only half-fired. Closure beat earns credible renunciation: she accepts ocean as launchpad, chain still in hand—cost felt. No competence inflation; humility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s gentle listener/curator persona is consistent and embodied in micro-gestures with the hearing-aid tuning; yet the interior contradiction between duty and fatigue never activates, so no new path is foreclosed—“incidental hero” is asserted rather than dramatized as a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—“to stand by the unremembered”—is stated early and threads every beat; her claustrophobia is embodied in helmet-hitches and wall-squeezes rather than labels. Micro-choices (codex placement, step into gaseous wall) align with motive and visibly cost calm. The interior arc—fear → purposeful endurance → earned lightness—lands cleanly, though researchers remain symbolic; no individual scientist complicates her stance. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; body and breath carry emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s heartbeat-counting compulsion is embodied early and drops away at closure, showing earned change; the porcelain shard reappears twice, its final placement capping her arc with visible cost. Interior contradiction is thin—she never actively fights the urge to count while defragmenting, so the micro-choice feels pre-ordained rather than pressured. The digital ghost supplies pressure but is an external prompt, not a relationship crucible, so status shifts are off-stage. Still, the counting quirk, memory-blame, and shard form a tight triad that individuates her and drives the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s vocation and physique are inseparable: the coppery veins glow under stress, her quiet articulation is tested by the diamond’s roar, and her final mimicry of the starlings is a corporeal gamble that costs her stability. Interior contradiction is live—she both courts and dreads the stone—and the renunciation of safe silence is paid in real dissonance. No diagnostic labels, only embodied sensation and a hierarchy of values that prizes translation over self-preservation. The reader feels the price in the final pressure against skin and mind.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s “turn pain into cosmic joke” motive is vivid early and steers every beat; his micro-choice to laugh at confessions rather than console is crystalline. Interiority slips into diagnostic gloss (“frostbitten hope”) once, muting embodied contradiction. The arrowhead’s warming in pocket offers tactile cost, earning the shift from despair to levity without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is declared repeatedly but never sharpened into a personal wound or memory; interiority stays generic (“she felt despair,” “her own heart light”). The locust shell is clutched twice yet never alters her tactical thinking on the page—she was already planning the heartbeat gambit—so the object doesn’t test or reveal character. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; once she decides, execution is frictionless, so the final “peace” feels unearned rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s “respectfully rebellious” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through a visible trade-off; the thunderstorm bottle is handled only once, denying a second beat to show hierarchy of values. Interiority drifts into diagnostic summary (“his motivation was simple yet profound”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mailman premise is vivid, yet the absence of on-page opposition leaves his flaw dormant and the Earned Stasis underpriced.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The carpenter’s quiet persistence is shown through tactile, rhythmic work; singing emerges as a credible, costly breach of lifelong silence. Interiority is concrete (“his hands spoke in whittles and polishes”). No second character, so relationship crucible is waived; Earned Stasis lands with visible cost—his voice, the halo’s glow, the reclaimed horses.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is consistently poetic-scientific, her scarf-triggered visions dramatized rather than reported; the final renunciation—letting the scarf dissolve—pays off a chain of micro-choices and costs her last physical link to grandmother, earning the “forever” stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s yearning is embodied in every gesture—painting with light, adjusting the camera, pouring herself into the palette—so the interior contradiction is alive. The final recognition of her mother lands as earned because the ache has been concretely rehearsed through her craft. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; the self-versus-loss conflict is sufficient. Micro-choices (exposure tweak, last sweep of light) reveal value hierarchy and carry visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test edge.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elian’s want (liberate the idea) is legible, but interiority stays abstract (“improbable longing” repeated) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; the locksmith moves from certainty to certainty. The lock of hair acts as a prop, not a crucible—its texture is noted once but never changes tactics or reveals flaw. Because no micro-choice under pressure carries visible cost, the arc lands as a smooth fable, not a character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s chronic curiosity is concretely dramatized through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, brushing fungus, realigning mushrooms). The internal split—yearning vs. fear of re-traumatizing—stays embodied, not therapized. Final restoration carries visible cost: trembling hands, receding water, groaning hulls—her body pays the price for memory return. Slight cap: grandfather remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible can’t fire; still, her stance shift is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s shift from angry exile to annotator who sees perception as the prison is dramatized through micro-choices—hand trembling on shard, confident final strokes—each motivated by the archivist’s combative prompts. The archivist’s backward-walking tic externalizes her own cost of mentorship, creating a lived contradiction that tightens the crucible. Interiority stays concrete: “anger is a shield” is immediately tested by the glass cool against skin. Only the “resilience is the sword” line drifts toward aphorism, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s interiority is lush (calloused hand, attunement to hush) and her micro-choices—extending the net of intention, planting the seed at the waterfall’s edge—embody the creative drive. The heirloom seed as extension of self gives a concrete proxy for her impulse, so the “insatiably creative” trait is lived, not labeled. No contradictory impulse is staged, so the arc is linear rather than crucible; the cost is aesthetic, not personal. Still, her calm competence and lack of flaw-driven setback keep her just shy of the 8-band where a harder trade-off would be required.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s calm competence never cracks; the “lucid unrest” is asserted, not dramatized. Kael is pure witness, offering no counter-pressure. No contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her steady hands, so the final calm feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s “perceptive map framer” identity is concrete—she rolls the map, aligns the tear, compares silent footage—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice; the widening fissure is discovered, not gambled on. The final emotional softening is tender yet cost is only asserted (“forever deepened”), not dramatized, so the arc stays shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief-archaeologist persona is vivid, but her contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) are asserted rather than enacted in scene; the epiphany is soft-revealed through reflective summary instead of a pressured micro-choice, so the cost feels conceptual, not embodied. “Quietly analytic” recurs as label, not demonstrated tactic under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lyrical but leans on abstract labels—“unspoken needs,” “suppressed longing”—rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (pressing, tracing, painting) are present yet feel predetermined by concept; no interior surprise complicates the arc. Flaw is acknowledged (silence) but no blind-spot generates a visible mistake or cost; the climax is recognition, not renunciation. Meets baseline for single-POV affective arc, but missing the hairline friction of genuine self-contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s “quiet drumbeat” motive is stated, not embodied; she deciphers passively, never risking anything or altering tactics. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply reads until insight arrives. The mirrored loneliness with the captain is touching but external; her own emotional cost never materializes on the page. End-state is unearned stasis, not a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s interiority is cloud-cataloguing abstraction rather than embodied crisis; the “quietly explosive” label is repeated but never manifests as believable physiological or contradictory thought. His mission stays static—no micro-choice under pressure tests or revises his drive—so the climactic “catalog complete” feels foregone, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The face-blind portraitist is a sharp, generative flaw: it powers her tactile search for the warm-spined safe and forces her to “feel” the sky rather than name it. Contradictory impulses (capture vs. release) coexist in the same beats, and her final renunciation—accepting the sky’s unframeability—carries visibly scaled cost as the demolition growl enters. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied in finger-on-spine and brush-in-pigment. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is repeatedly named but only once dramatized—when she kneels to decode the hopscotch board; otherwise she observes, sketches, and explains without contradiction or cost. The final moment of “sociable isolation” is asserted, not embodied: we are told she feels separate even as the captain claps her shoulder, but no interior fracture or forfeiture is shown. Competence outweighs struggle; the journal entry and phrasebook use proceed without error or hesitation, so the discovery feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s longing for “the rhythm of repair” is vivid, but interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“driftwood nostalgia”) rather than contradictory bodily impulse. Micro-choices are present—uncapping the vial, selecting a gear—but the stakes leap from curiosity to cosmic repair without a tightening beat that shows her risking failure or loss. The ending pivot from wistful seeker to world-mender feels more declared than earned; no visible cost (fatigue, doubt, foreclosed option) attaches to her new power, blunting the arc’s credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s calloused fingers on chalk and her dawn rally show embodied leadership, but the cast swells to three without distinct interior contradiction; the ghost’s altruism is asserted, never tested by a counter-impulse, so motive change feels gentle rather than costly. Micro-choices (Jax’s kick, Kael’s resonance leap) are present yet compressed; still, the relational crucible is thin because the ghost never risks failure or rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s scarred hands and “weight of eras” eyes give instant, embodied history; every micro-choice—placing the cracked puppet head, drawing the lullaby from its hollow—springs from her witnessed apocalypses. The story lets her flaws (regret, exhaustion) actively complicate the final sacrifice, so her extinction feels earned, not messianic. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of the 9+ contradiction test.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s reluctant duty → stubborn need to guide is vivid; the shift to “quiet acceptance” lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete (“graceless beauty” perception, nut’s cool shell). Micro-choices (ducking bronze bird, timing light-arrows) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Flaw: single-scene window keeps relationships off-page; no secondary pressure, so crucible angle muted—caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aris’s guilt and scientific lens feel concrete; the “symphonically minded” trait repeats but never actively shapes a beat beyond metaphor. His shift from self-laceration to collaborative synthesis is credible, yet the interior monologue stays safely paraphrased rather than dramatized under pressure, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s desire to locate “where stories begin” gives a sharp, externalized goal, but her interior contradictions are asserted rather than dramatized—she never visibly hesitates, fears, or risks anything concrete. The empty vial at the end supplies a token image of cost, yet the loss is abstract; we feel no forfeiture of body, relationship, or future action. Because pressure is generated by cosmic scenery rather than by an opposing force or a self-imposed limit, her final stance reads as serene declaration, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s “taste memories” gift is shown through embodied action—tracing wet coral, trembling hands—rather than label. Interior contradiction is present: he courts contagious grief yet fears drowning in it. The final beat earns a credible renunciation: he absorbs centuries of sorrow, foreclosing the option to remain merely a voyeur chef; the cost is the sharp-sweet tang of lost love now permanently resident on his tongue. Micro-choices under pressure (touching the pillar, tasting regret) align with his stated motive, though the reader never learns why this specific fortress or why now—slight motivational thinness keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but generic; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she simply decides, then sings. The three villagers arrive as labeled types; their speech is indistinct and none is forced to pay a personal price. “Empathetically decisive” is asserted, never tested by a costly micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—engineer’s precision vs. dream-archeologist hunger—stay live in every mirror-tilt, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“synaptic plasticity”) that flattens embodied cost. The final stance crystallizes with visible price: she forfeits her prior self-narrative, but the turn is rushed inside one clause, blunting the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s prism-mind idea intrigues but remains a label; she never refracts contradictory readings aloud inside beats. Embodied emotion is present (“boots finding purchase on what was now the floor, though it felt like the sky”), yet interior contradiction flattens once she passes the final arch—no last self-doubt, cost is only asserted (“mind now a prism”). Micro-choices under pressure are clear until the vault, where the story summarizes her resolve rather than dramatizing the final trade-off. Meets baseline for earned endurance but lacks the visceral cost that would punch the closure into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s solitary, symphonically-minded interiority is rendered through tactile micro-choices—tracing bark, breathing shallow, threading her own hair into the bridge—so her final strum feels earned. The only flaw: the “empathy in motion” refrain is named more than dramatized after the mid-point, softening the sense of internal contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s exile-grief and chess-trained precision weave cleanly through every beat; the worry-stone gesture embodies rather than labels his anxiety. The final micro-choice—pressing the dent into the lodestone ridge—crystallizes his values with visible cost (the energy surge that “flooded” him). Interior contradiction is muted: he never seriously contemplates abandoning the quest, so the arc is more solemn execution than crucible. Still, the earned stillness of the closing image satisfies the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s pacifist-silence vocation is vivid and embodied; her trembling hands and crystalline device ground interiority. Yet the diary entries are summarized, not dramatized, so the promised contradiction between witnessing noise and cataloguing silence is asserted rather than enacted under pressure. No visible flaw complicates her competence—she unlocks the clasp on first try—so the “cost” feels aesthetic, not characterological. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the final renunciation of fireworks for inner stillness lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s ambition is embodied in her stained fingers and nightly journal ritual; the olfactory gift is shown, not told, and directly enables the climactic scent-shift that cracks the seed. Interior contradiction—ambition vs. patience—stays active in scene, culminating in the earned micro-choice to stop forcing growth. The cost is quiet but legible: she accepts a slower, humbler cultivation, foreclosing her previous urgency. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority stays particular and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s curiosity about resilience is stated early and his actions track, yet interiority is generic (“his stomach lurched,” “he felt a pull”) rather than specific-to-him. No contradictory impulses or visible flaw complicate his steady competence, so the climax risks epiphany rather than earned shift. Still, the arrow-tip micro-choice under gravity flip shows micro-agency and a cost—he risks drifting helpless—so the arc lands solidly if not dangerously.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his boot scuff, the patch’s weight in-pocket—but his “rapid adapting” is reported more than dramatized; we watch him shift stance, not cognition. The final moment crystallizes a believable renunciation (he leaves with the patch and a storm of prevention), so motivation earns its cost. Still, no contradiction under pressure is shown inside one beat; the micro-choice that forecloses path is the quiet pocketing, not a visible tactical trade-off. Competent, affecting, but not yet razor-deep.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s synesthetic gift and her mission to “certify wonder” are vivid, but interiority stays safely lyrical; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice ever threatens her resolve, so the climax feels pre-ordained rather than personally costly. The absence of a live opposition or risk flattens the arc into pure affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the silence felt heavier than any duty”), his flaw-clouded judgment is dramatized through the portal walk-through of past failures, and the final renunciation of old duty is micro-choices-driven. Still, the sole on-page character limits relational crucible tests, and the self-forgiveness arc edges toward tidy calibration, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting to quantify emotion while drowning in borrowed selves—remains vivid; the embodied grief/joy collision is a sharp beat. Her final renunciation (locking the cooled fragment away) is foreshadowed by her ink-stained fingers and the press’s lock-like click, so the cost lands. Yet the “mathematics of emotion” motive stays abstract; no concrete equation or failed formula ever appears on the page, blunting the sense of a live intellectual stake. The stoic cartographer’s loneliness is the only borrowed trait that alters her spatial perception, so most imprints feel interchangeable rather than tactical.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass through the press thickens the emotional density until the final sheet strips ambiguity away, a clean pattern break. Causality is interior but legible—because she keeps feeding personalities in, therefore the fragment finally feeds on her. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the halo fragment reweights from tool to mirror, making the cost (her own essence lost and returned) undeniable. The vanished stars and first dawn bracket the action cleanly; orientation is never in doubt.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The topaz dome and ink-slick press constrain every motion; the fragment’s iridescence literally colors the walls, charging the final image when its glow dies. Night-sky orientation is economical—fading stars serve as a live clock that tightens the frame. Spatial choreography holds: the press, bench, drawer, and Elara’s hands stay tracked without drift. Workshop texture is specific to visual and tactile senses; sound (lock-click) is used only twice, keeping the beat spare.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will she survive her own experiment—escalates as each sheet increases emotional turbulence; the fragment’s brightening is an objective correlative for rising risk. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cartographer’s loneliness warps the walls, foreclosing the option of safe detachment. Cost is paid on the page: trembling hands, spatial hallucination, and the final extraction of her own essence. No coincidence or external rescue dilutes the pressure; the risk is self-inflicted and self-settled.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the impossibility of mapping feeling onto numbers is shown through the literal stacking of voices until meaning collapses into a single legible line. The shifted meaning of “deliberate ambiguity”—from method to enemy—creates a quiet irony that reconfigures prior material. No moral is asserted; the drawer’s click is an Earned Stasis that forecloses further experiment. The final image of cooled glass reframes the quest as vanity, leaving a concrete emotional aftereffect of emptied clarity.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: ink, starlight, and metallic press clicks filter through Elara’s precision-obsessed gaze. Syntax modulates from long liquid sentences under starlight to staccato clauses (“She pressed on”) as pressure peaks. No head-hopping; fragment glow and wall breathing are sensed strictly through her skin. Free indirect style is clean: “the mathematics she sought remained elusive” carries her own diction without filter-verb clutter.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
    <comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—lock-click, halo light—none contradict prior physics. Rhythm breathes with the press strokes; no template cadence or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new rule (“now just a cool piece of glass”) with propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jittery courier trait stated, not embodied—hands shake once, then vanish; no contradictory impulse under pressure. Mentor absence is back-story label; it never alters his on-page choices. Final “calm determination” declared, not earned; no micro-choice shows the shift. Interiority drifts into prompt-speak: “coax wonder from the routine” repeated like thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her guilt surfaces through embodied memory rather than confession. The micro-choice to keep walking after seeing her own complicity lands with visible cost. However, the friend-abandonment backstory is asserted in one retrospective sentence; dramatizing a flash or sensory cue would have raised the score. Still, the hierarchy of values (truth > self-image) is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “tracing patterns only she could see,” the bead’s glint a constant sensory anchor. The contradiction between clinging to memory and surrendering self is dramatized in the final dissolve: she steps into the loom-light knowing she will vanish. One flaw: the “latent sacrifice” motive is declared rather than shown as a mounting interior wound; we are told the cost “weighed heavy” instead of watching it gnaw through micro-choices earlier. Still, her stoic endurance and the embodied amber bead create a credible, earned vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian’s meek-quiet/determined contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; only the final forging beat shows embodied resolve. Interiority recycles “resilience-from-rubble” phrasing without fresh micro-choices inside the mine or at the forge. The mage scene supplies external pressure, but Elian’s internal stakes remain abstract—no visible cost or flaw-driven mistake. Closure is earned, yet the emotional gear-shift is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s quiet, sea-calibrated interiority is consistently shown through tactile beats (hand on cold wall, sea-glass palm). The contradiction between his reticence and the need to “protect” is dramatized in the decisive act of relighting, so the final endurance carries cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (placing glass, stacking cairn) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; “shadowed elation” repeats without bodily signature. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—he simply knows and laughs. The single micro-choice—adjusting lenses—never risks failure or loss, so the closing stasis feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen’s curiosity is vivid, but he never makes a visible choice that costs him anything; the illumination simply happens to him. The donor-heart backstory is evocative yet never alters present tactics or creates interior contradiction. “Quietly explosive” stays a label—no beat shows calm cracking into risky action. Closure is observation, not renunciation or decision, so the arc feels observational rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s want to “discover what trees witness” is lyric but never dramatized as an active choice under pressure; the mapping of dreams is the only tactical move and that action is narrated in summary, so no hierarchy of values is tested. The moon-heal trait is stated, not used at cost (she never risks staying in moonlight or fears cloud-cover). No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; interiority is delivered as thematic label (“quantified sorrow”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure is a gentle diffusion, not a renunciation or crystallized stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically sustained—her fragmented memory shows in how she “clings to one solid truth” and hums “scattered notes.” The final memory-coalescence is earned through the escalating song-pressure on the page. However, her contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized in mid-action; we are told she feels “insurmountable” and “gathered her courage” rather than shown a micro-choice that visibly costs her. Still, the singing-as-swaddle is a bespoke, irreversible act that fuses flaw and remedy, satisfying the arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s empathetic recluse profile is established early and anchors her paradoxical drive to connect while hiding. The interiority is vivid (“the world’s pains her own”), but the flashback to the betrayal is summarized, muting the embodied cost that could have sharpened guilt. Micro-choices—pressing the book, choosing the corner—are present yet low-stakes; the ritual audience with the elder supplies warmth but no status friction or irreversible cost. The final shift to “enlarged tranquility” is credible, yet causality is more atmospheric than earned through a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “quiet method,” the tactile care when shifting marble, the breath-catch when the journal mirrors her fear—so we feel contradictory impulses under pressure. The flaw/competence balance is right: she breaks vines, startles birds, yet keeps gardening; the final image of her “gentle hands” crystallizes an earned stance with cost. No head-count or status issues; single-POV holds. Micro-choices (placing the bread, opening the seam) directly reveal her hierarchy of values and foreclose passive nostalgia—high-band but not hairline-perfect because the journal’s voice is slightly over-articulate for a gardener’s diary, a nano-slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s “gently meticulous” trait is lived-in: every handling of the lantern slide, every dial-turn is a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—frost seeping into bones, the ache in his chest—never sliding into diagnostic speak. The arc is credible endurance: he cannot save the vows, only honor them, and that renunciation carries visible cost in the dimming slide and the library’s final sigh. One-step short of exceptional because no contradictory impulse is allowed to test him in scene; his stance is set from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is sharply rendered—her tactile attention to the watch fob, her irrational desire to “capture the sound of trust breaking” show a particular mind. The false-start ruse is dramatized in two silent loops that reveal her hierarchy of values (family secrecy > personal safety). Yet her emotional contradiction—sorrowful peace after a violent betrayal she engineered—is only asserted, not embodied in a final micro-choice; the cost is felt but not crystallized on the page, capping the arc just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interior skepticism is concrete—her glow intensifies with doubt, a vivid physicalization. The taste-based compass use gives her a sensory, embodied decision path. Yet her moment of “realization” at the end is stated, not dramatized: “She realized her luminosity was not just skepticism…” lands as an abstract epiphany rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything. Because the climactic internal shift is summarized, not performed, the arc feels slightly under-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—gifted recall that now sharpens emptiness—drives every beat; the broken-lock epiphany feels earned because her mnemonic gift is dramatized earlier (“unlocking the memory instantly”). Micro-choices (tracing the jagged metal, sketching her younger face) embody cost. The shift from blocked to uncorked is credible, but the gallery mockery is off-stage, softening the crucible that forged her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aria’s obsession with vanished conversations is visceral and embodied; her shaking hand at the leaf-vein moment sells it. The lie-wilt mechanic is shown, not labeled, and forces her to hunt for candor in real time. One contradiction pulses: she both mourns lost words and hoards zinc plates that literally store them—yet this tension is left as texture rather than dramatized choice. Final inscription stance is earned; cost is the toxic sky she must re-enter, leaves glowing against it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s seasonal muteness and tactile bell-tuning create a vivid, embodied persona; her drive to “preserve the color of wonder” is clear but remains abstract, never crystallizing into a concrete fear of loss or memory. Interiority is atmospherically rich yet loops on the same lyrical note (“the color of wonder,” “symphonies of truth”) without contradictory impulse or micro-choice that risks anything tangible. The climax shows her silent tears and brightening ice, a credible emotional payoff, but the cost is aesthetic rather than personal—no bell cracks, no solitude deepens, no future threat materializes. Character is memorable and cohesive; it only lacks a sharper private stake that would make the triumph feel wrested instead of bestowed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic caretaker vs. static-burdened fugitive—are dramatized in every beat: the tactile fondling of the fear-box, the micro-choice to compress rather than destroy, the final renunciation of the dome. His embodied emotion (“inner static” rendered as auditory corruption, vision flickering) stays particular to an android POV. The decisive change—abandoning caretaker role yet carrying condensed fears—pays the visible cost of exile and identity split, fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and curator-specific; her micro-choice to “ask around the courtyard” rather than confront the driver shows a believable, trait-driven tactic. The embodied contradiction—professional detachment versus emotional compulsion—surfaces in the tactile hesitation before she opens the locket. Mr. Hemlock’s silence and sudden speech flood feel earned because the text seeds his ritual loss early through the baker and Mrs. Gable. Only the final “sandstorm calm” line drifts into generic external tagging rather than her body, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical, specific, and embodied; the “encrypt vulnerability as strength” motive pulses through every micro-choice. The dance-cipher trait is not label-only—it drives the decoding beats and final liberation. One slip: the phrase “calm defiance solidify within her” drifts toward diagnostic self-awareness (−0.2). Still, contradictory impulses (fear woven into power) charge the final gesture, earning the renunciation cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The private, gnawing need to recover deleted memories is anchored in a concrete relic (pressed wildflowers) and drives every beat; the final floating release in the salt chamber embodies the cost of regaining her past. Interiority is atmospheric rather than diagnostic—gravity tugs mirror emotional weight without label-speak. One flaw: the decision to forget is revealed only in the buried letters, so the prior interior conflict is retroactive rather than simultaneously felt on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elian’s solitude and “map silence” motive are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory choice; interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“a tranquil blaze of determination burned”) rather than embodied tension. No visible flaw or blind spot complicates his success, so the hush feels foreordained, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s longing to “learn the language of old buildings” is vivid and embodied; the obedient suspension of disbelief about Finch’s ghostliness feels character-specific. Yet Finch himself remains a graceful cipher—his only interior contradiction is the wistful smile—and the narrator’s micro-choices never sharpen into a painful trade-off, so the promised “cost” of the final transfer of the seal is inferred rather than dramatized. The relationship does function as crucible, but the shift is sentimental, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “ghostly resolve” is shown through tactile action in the moss, the shell’s pulsing light syncing with her heartbeat. The contradiction between skepticism and charmed compulsion is implied but never enacted in scene, so the trait stays decorative. The final renunciation is earned: the archived memory costs her the last auditory whisper, a concrete forfeiture. Still, her flaw/struggle is self-therapy speak (“translate isolation into independence”) rather than a live internal contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s guilt and desire for release are legible, but the interiority leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“forgive the unfinished,” “wise endurance”) rather than embodied, scene-specific contradiction. The heritage thorn is the only tangible anchor; her moment-to-moment micro-choices are summarized, not dramatized, so the final peace feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s interiority stays abstract—"richly perceptive" is asserted, never shown through idiosyncratic noticing. His final choice to sing truth feels inevitable, but the cost is only declared ("sadness of discovery") rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse ever threatens his resolve, so the arc is smooth, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is evocative—his glacier shrine rituals and dream-snooping feel lived-in—but the story never lets us *feel* him flinch. The moment he informs Anya, a beat that should cost him something, is narrated from outside: “Tears welled in her eyes” instead of his own body registering the emotional tariff. The promised flaw (truth-weaving) never collides with a limits-test; he succeeds without visible internal abrasion, so the arc flattens into competence rather than contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelen’s quiet, contemplative arc is internally coherent—his micro-choices (whistle, whisk, net-mending) embody the “hidden effort” creed. Yet no contradictory impulse ever threatens that creed; he never hesitates, errs, or pays a price, so the change is observational, not crucible-forged. The final candle-lit mending merely restates the insight already voiced on the parapet, so the cost feels intellectual, not viscerable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s drive to “excavate truth” propels every action; his observant trait shows in concrete pattern-spotting (ring-counting, dust-still moment). Interiority stays grounded in bodily sensation rather than labels. The final choice crystallizes earlier motive, but because we only glimpse the cost starting to return (dust creeping back), the emotional price feels legible yet not fully dramatized; still, the character arc is coherent and earned under situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—she reads the “rivulets of rain on the cobalt glass portico” as prophecy, not décor. The “lyrically prophetic” voice is consistent and character-bound, and her descent is driven by a micro-choice: the clear unity broadcast that overturns her exile. Cost is visible—she forfeits her sky-guarded solitude and trades it for muddy politics—yet the “ancient shadows” she wields are asserted more than dramatized, blunting flaw-to-choice linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s desire to “translate between generations” is stated early and his ritual of jarring sound gives him a distinctive vocation, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“old regrets and older hopes”) rather than dramatized in-scene; no moment shows him tempted to stop or to hoard a jar, so the arc is static rather than intensifying. The final beat—packing the jars and feeling “contentment”—is a summary label instead of an embodied cost or renunciation, so the change feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—breath misting, key warming, heartbeat syncing with ice—but “logically emotional” never crystallizes into a visible contradiction that costs him on the page; the trait merely labels. His final choice to merge with the key’s frequency is smooth, yet feels inevitable rather than wrested from clashing impulses. No moment forces him to betray logic for emotion or vice-versa, so the arc is competent but not scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—impatience transmuted into exacting lunar calm—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choices (lodestone tweak, boot-sole hum) keep the tension live. The “sculpt patience” motive is stated often, but each reprise is tied to a concrete sensorial cue, escaping label-speak. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; her solo arc earns a credible renunciation of haste with felt cost in the final breath. Minor redundancy in “softly purposeful” refrain nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s investigator ethos is shown through concrete sensory sweeps and the ledger find, but her internal contradiction—yearning for autonomy while staying placid—never tightens into a visible micro-choice under Thorn’s threat; the refusal to surrender the ledger is asserted, not dramatized with observable cost. The ancestral lantern memory is evocative yet serves as thematic wallpaper until the final line; it doesn’t force a present-tense mistake or trade-off that would reveal a genuine blind spot. Competence dominates struggle: she catalogues, sidesteps, exits—never misreads, hesitates, or pays an immediate price that would complicate her calm. Result: a credible, sympathetic protagonist who remains static rather than fracturing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    The chaplain’s guilt and need for redemption are palpable, but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“a guilt he had carried for years”). His embodied emotion is strongest when handling the gears; the final shift to teacher/advocate is earned, yet the woman remains a functional helper rather than a second crucible, capping relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s curiosity and iconoclasm are vividly rendered through her tactile interaction with the arrow tip and the kaleidoscope, but the “unheard bell” motive stays abstract; we witness no interior contradiction or visible cost when she feeds the transliteration back, so the final laugh feels performative rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession with “where deleted files go” is concrete and drives every beat; the interiority stays technical-archivist, never generic. The moment she links the patch’s thread to a broadcast frequency, her perceptual lens tightens—micro-choice visible. Cost is felt at the end: she preserves the data but accepts the case will stay cold, an earned stasis that pays for her lie. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the arc is competent rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s calm intuition is shown through gliding travel and silent concentration, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“failed to prevent”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The final empathy act is credible because the orb vision supplies motive, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals a competing impulse; the decision feels single-track. Earned cost is present—the shard cuts his palm, the orb’s warmth marks him—but the story summarizes the internal shift instead of letting us watch him weigh release-versus-risk in a charged beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into therapy-speak (“she practiced a fold in patience”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The parasol tip works as tactile tether, yet the planned-death pivot is declared, not embodied in scene, so the cost feels pre-cooked. Still, the stance crystallization at the end is legible and earned by accretion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“nurture intersubjective understanding”) that no grieving man would articulate mid-epiphany; body cues are generic (“calloused fingers,” “sigh”). The renunciation is soft: he “gently persuaded himself” rather than enacted a visible refusal; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Reflection exceeds 30 % without altering present tactics until the final paragraph, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s “strangely honest” trait is asserted repeatedly but never shown complicating a choice (no moment where candor costs him). Interiority is generic (“he felt compelled,” “his motivation…transformed”) rather than body-level or contradictory. The mask is a striking visual but never limits perception or social risk; removing it at the end reads cosmetic. Preservation drive is clear, yet no micro-choice on the page is jeopardized by that desire—consecration succeeds without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s calm-perceptive lens is consistent, but her interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“transmute pain into a masterpiece”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. No visible cost attaches to her choices; she lingers, arranges, listens, but nothing is foreclosed. Mr. Hemlock’s grief is the only beat that pressures her stance, yet she remains a passive conduit, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “quiet obsession” is stated, but her interiority is mostly generic scholar-poet. The final decision to speak is forecast early yet arrives without new contradiction or micro-cost; the only embodied beat is the “rare, gentle curve” of a smile—too late to ratchet pressure. Reticence is told, not dramatized in her body or micro-gestures under the chandelier. Motivation is clear but never complicated by a visible flaw or stakes that could be lost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness is vivid and embodied—every driftwood placement is a micro-choice under memory-loss pressure. Yet the interiority loops: “tidal longing” and “echo” abstractions repeat without new contradiction after the midpoint. The chalk snap is a crisp Earned Stasis, but the amnesia that follows erases the cost’s emotional residue a beat too cleanly. Still, his flaw drives every beat; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is palpably embodied (“luminous ache,” “steady and wise hands”), her lifelong craft and lunar solitude credibly motivate the obsessive capture, and the micro-choice to halt the clock with a leaf recording visibly costs her peace, but the absence of any second character keeps relationship/status dynamics off-stage, capping the crucible test. Still, her arc lands as earned renunciation: she trades perpetual motion for a single, static image of fire, and the price glows in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s calm, decisive kindness is dramatized through micro-choices—smoothing sheets, choosing the shard, guiding the recording—each tethered to her goal of a painless farewell. Alistair’s memories and forgiveness are similarly embodied, not declared. The only softness is that his interiority late (“renewed peace”) drifts toward label; still, the characterization sustains the stakes and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is concrete and embodied—tracing runes, clutching the key, bleeding onto the spiral—so her drive never feels abstract. Yet the interiority stays safely scholarly; we see no genuine flaw or contradictory impulse that would complicate her choices under pressure. The micro-choice to offer blood is visible cost, but it arrives as ritual beat rather than crucible that rewrites her self-image. She earns the reopening of loops, yet the emotional invoice feels academic, not existential.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“the hollow replica discovered in the woods had shattered that illusion”—but the emotional arc is told more than embodied. The decisive turn relies on a declarative mantra (“Everything is a story waiting to be rewritten”) rather than a micro-choice that costs her something visible. Skepticism and forgiveness are asserted, not dramatized in a single irreversible action. The earned shift feels conceptual, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich—"weigh the heavy truths of her isolated life against the vastness of the cosmos"—and the micro-choice to polish the glass dramatizes her motive. The final renunciation (leaving the grotto to share light) carries visible cost in the loss of solitary refuge, earning the shift. Flaw: one moment of therapeutic self-label—"a tangible core of calm"—slips into diagnostic-speak, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her attention to light, moss, the pendant’s warmth. The offering to Leo crystallizes her shift from shame to shared future; the quiet pact earns its cost in on-page trust. Secondary pressure minimal, but the two-handed scene sustains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s desire to “collect hopes” is stated repeatedly but never interiorized as a concrete, contradictory impulse; she performs the same ritual beat with each ghost, so no escalating choice or cost differentiates them. The shell warms and glows, yet this never endangers her or forces a trade-off, so the “anchor” object does not test her. Interiority stays at label level (“conflicted novelist,” “no longer conflicted”) rather than dramatized contradiction. Final stance is asserted, not earned by a visible forfeiture or micro-choice that could foreclose an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority stays concrete—she palms the vine, hums on cue, and her whimsical tinkerer bent shows in the way she “tinkered with the melodies.” No epiphany overload; the final peace is earned by the chain of song-beats. Flaw: no visible contradiction or micro-choice that hurts; she’s serene throughout, so cost is present but not conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied patience and the contradiction between volatile alchemy and deliberate motion are vividly shown through micro-choices (arranging shards in spirals, lighting flash-paper with chapped hands). The interior drive “to translate heartbeats into maps” is anchored to tactile ritual, so the final sealing feels earned. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The slight reserve from 9+ is that the cost (cold, time, personal risk) is named but not dramatized in a way that visibly alters later tactics; it’s felt, yet not compounded into a visible mistake or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s quiet obsession is credibly particular—his fingers “cradled” the timer, his gaze “drifting to edges”—but the interior contradiction never sharpens; he wants to bottle wonder yet faces no moment where that desire collides with a cost that hurts.  The final “certainty” he carries out reads as calm summary rather than a renunciation that forecloses anything; we are told he is satisfied, not shown what he forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive is stated early and re-iterated, but her interiority stays at lyric summary (“boundary-lessly trapped”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. Emotions are named, not embodied—no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The calcification ritual is repeated without escalating cost or error; she never risks failure, so the arc is flat. Love’s final lattice is pretty but unmotivated beyond the prompt’s mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The widow’s interiority is vivid—grief rendered as bodily precision “hands steady despite the tremor in her soul.” The contradiction between practical carving and raw ache acts in-scene, not summary. One flaw: “harvest lessons from loss” drifts into self-help register in the final paragraph, slightly diluting the earned grit.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her need to “negotiate” yet inability to reorder memory—are dramatized in every tactile beat: twisting the jammed camera wheel, wading into thick water, finally releasing the wheel. The camera’s failed click exteriorizes her eroded ambition while her body keeps making micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the wheel) is prepared by the accumulating sensory cost: boots sinking, mist thickening, stories dissolving. Ghost remains off-page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A; head-count stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kaelen’s curiosity and functional creativity are shown through tactile mapping and jury-rigging, but interior contradiction is thin; his stoic register stays flat across beats, muting the cost of failure. The sextant choice to leave it behind is a credible renunciation, yet the emotional price feels declared (“quiet satisfaction”) rather than embodied. Still, micro-choices (tracing railing, aligning reflectors) track a consistent engineer’s gaze, keeping the arc coherent if not viscerally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s excruciating gentleness is shown, not told, in every motion; the ache of the silenced-music motif is concrete and embodied. Interior contradiction—yearning for symphony while caressing clock gears—remains active in scene, powering the final renunciation. The shift from mourning the dream to embracing “the rhythm of the clocks” is fully earned, with visible cost: she closes the clock face, foreclosing the old ambition. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-awareness; the nostalgia stays sensory (petrichor, dripping eaves) rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s ache to exhume family betrayal is concrete, but her interiority loops: “training instincts” is retold more than dramatized. No contradictory impulse undercuts her resolve; she glides from doubt to clarity without micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. The pocket sundial is handled, yet its emotional meaning is declared, not discovered through risky action. Closure lands as CR, but the cost is only conceptual; we feel no forfeiture, so the change is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s collector-philosopher identity is vividly anchored through tactile seed packets and the fulgurite lens, but “infinite patience” is asserted more than dramatized—no moment shows her fighting impatience or paying a visible price for it. The interiority is poetic yet generic (“heart full”) rather than specific and contradictory under pressure. Because the weavers do all the final gifting, her agency in the climax is receptive, weakening the earned-change test. Still, her quiet, embodied reverence for rope and snow differentiates her from stock seekers.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prince’s interiority is concrete (“bedraggled appearance spoke of countless failures”) and his micro-choice—whispering apology to the egg—embodies contradictory hope/despair. The “bitterly sweet” refrain edges toward diagnostic shorthand, muting full embodiment at the hinge beat; still, the final renunciation (accepting the ephemeral bird) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory lineage (arsonist’s child who fights fire) is embodied in every tactile choice—kneeling in black sand, mixing volcanic paste, surrendering the coin—so the internal split stays live. The graft beat forces her to risk her own peace to give the girl voice; the coin transfer crystallizes cost. One slip: “haunted her steps” drifts toward label-speak; a sharper sensory cue would lock 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s desire to “liberate trapped memories” is declared early and repeated, but the interior contradiction between skepticism and luminous calling is asserted, not dramatized. She makes only one high-stakes choice—aligning the box under the stars—and the cost (fatigue, doubt) is named rather than felt. The lack of embodied struggle under pressure keeps the arc functional but short of publishable complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically sustained (“troubling serenity,” “beauty approximated infinity”) yet remains abstract-label rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly costs her until the final sonic encoding, so the climactic renunciation feels serene rather than painfully earned. The brass gear functions as inherited talisman, but its generational weight is asserted, not dramatized through conflicting impulses. Voice stays consistent, but emotional stakes stay at a meditative remove; we witness a mood, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—carver of permanence chasing impermanent grief—anchors every beat; her fierce meditation visibly costs sweat and delayed blinks, not told labels. The ancestral poem-trades erupt as whispered, half-remembered lines under broken glass, bodying her value hierarchy without exposition. Yet the grandfather ghost acts as external conscience, softening the blind-spot tension that should compound mistakes; she never misreads a ribbon or misroutes a butterfly, so growth feels gently serendipitous rather than wrested. Closure still lands: she accepts grief’s fluidity, rolls the ribbons, foregoes stone-fixity—Earned Stasis visible in soot-smudged palms.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt-soaked diligence is tangible in every micro-adjustment; the embodied memory of flood-water screams keeps his interiority specific. The broken-rake-handle cipher gives his grandfather a ghost-presence that pressures the present choice. Final self-forgiveness is earned beat-by-beat through visible calibrations, not declared. A hairline slip into “incremental absolution” label-speak at the climax keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity is credibly rooted in her occupation and thesilence after the chess clock, but interiority remains atmospheric (“felt a pull”) rather than a concrete contradiction in scene. Micro-choices are present (tracing threads, opening hidden compartment) yet the emotional cost of these actions is asserted, not embodied—no sweat, tremor, or hesitation is shown. The final commitment to “carry that torch” is earned by discovery, but the prior gardener’s disappearance is external lore, not lived tension that complicates her inside this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his predictive hesitations, the trembling quill, the “intensity of focus” all embody motive. The single on-page character meets the scope default; contradiction between fear of chaos and need to act is kept live until the final sentence cedes agency to unseen readers, a credible, visible cost. No relationship crucible required. Micro-choices (ink dip, first word) map directly onto stakes, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. clandestine yearning—animates every beat; the moment she whispers decoded lyrics to dust and watches it crown, her renunciation of safety is earned. No secondary character applies pressure, yet her micro-choices under surveillance risk (notation tampering) scale credibly. Flaw: “thistled calm” leans toward diagnostic label, not embodied cost; still, the final image of dust glowing with stolen stories shows visible, priced endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the grandfather yet need to pulverize his mask—are dramatized in the grinding scene; the embodied cost (palms cut, dust in lungs) is vivid. Interiority stays concrete, tied to charcoal, ash, resin. The final stance—accepting a fragile truth—feels earned because the pestle’s violence was staged as a necessary renunciation. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; even “mirage” is filtered through sensory ash.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is granular and embodied—her fingers feel the “brass cog…heavy in her pocket” and her thoughts loop through “whirlpool of doubt and determination.” The “rationally rebellious” trait drives every micro-choice (rejecting superstitions, scraping charts, inscribing metal scraps) with visible cost (further isolation, physical exhaustion). No epiphany is declared; instead, her resolve crystallizes in the final beat of “abrasive calm,” a credible endurance that forecloses silence. The only minor slip is the abstract label “philosopher” which is never tested in dialogue with another mind, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract—“expectantly resigned,” “unlearning hatred”—yet never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse or micro-choice that costs her anything. The rosette discovery is passive (she simply opens a chest) and her final instruction to the choir is paraphrased, so the visible cost is off-loaded onto students rather than embodied by her. No genuine flaw or status tension is dramatized on the page, so the “harmony” feels willed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s gentle-rebel persona is consistent, but her interiority leans on paraphrased abstractions (“profound sense of connection”) rather than embodied contradiction. The pruning micro-choices are visible, yet the synaptic-plasticity gift is asserted more than dramatized; we never taste a memory in real time, so the flaw complicates rather than compels. The final stance is earned, but the cost is softened to “quiet hope” instead of a tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s involuntary truth-telling is dramatized early and shapes the inciting exchange; her micro-choice to chant the riddle while Kael sprays the rods embodies her “wonder in routine” motive. Yet the interiority lapses into lofty abstractions (“light sleeps in storm’s trance”) that feel authored, not lived, and Kael remains a functional helper rather than a status antagonist, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “creeping-normality” gift is shown through concrete sensory vigilance (bay inches, oak slowing), giving her a sharp perceptual signature. The orris-root placement is a micro-choice that visibly costs her childhood certainty, cementing her motivation. Interiority avoids diagnostic jargon, instead using tactile memory (“scent of violets and memory”). Still, the moment of realization feels slightly paraphrased rather than embodied, and no secondary character is present to test status dynamics, holding this short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is poetic but stays abstract—“incisively kind” is repeated instead of enacted; the only embodied moment is the reach for the ampoule. The decision to pour the memory-essence is credible, yet the cost (loss of solitude, burden of guardianship) is declared, not dramatized in body or voice. Still, the statue’s shift from stasis to curator is legible and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly precision vs. dice-rolled daring—stays alive in every micro-choice; the chipped die pressed into her thumb is a tactile emblem of that flaw. The final turn from capturing a lost moment to accepting its transformation is foreshadowed by the die’s imbalance, so the renunciation feels earned. One slip: “grim optimism” is named repeatedly but never shown through bodily tension or contradictory gesture until late; a single diagnostic label mid-crisis costs the 0.3 that keeps it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s insomnia and painter identity are concretely anchored, but her interiority drifts into generic “methodically hopeful” abstractions rather than embodied contradiction. The remembered scenes are felt through her body, yet she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the visions happen to her. Because no option is foreclosed on the page, the arc remains observational rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her body registers the grotto’s chill and the “sad, hard loaf” of failure—but contradictory impulses are only asserted, not dramatized side-by-side. The final success is motivated by the lens-cue, yet the causality is external (found note) rather than a choice that costs her on the page. Competence is balanced with struggle, and her flaw (idealized nostalgia) complicates, but the emotional crescendo is slightly under-cooked because the price is communal, not personally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s monomaniacal drive to “step beyond fate” is voiced early and threads every beat; her tactile handling of the yoyo and stone shows micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—“the radiance flickered, responding to her touch as if recognizing a kindred spirit of reversal”—avoiding label-speak. The final laugh is a credible, costly renunciation: she pays with total unmooring. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets default out; head-count stays within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s fear of post-death hollowness is embodied in trembling confession and the clasp-crush in her pocket; the paradoxical dictionary notes externalize inner contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation—casting the clasp—pays the cost of identity-emptiness with a visible forfeiture, earning her earned stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“heartbeat a fragile, foreign rhythm”) and avoids label-speak until the slightly therapeutic “I am just an echo,” which keeps the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Solitary prophet’s contradiction—yearning to transmute silence yet addicted to the next threat—stays implicit; the micro-choices (charcoal sketch, naming chords, final strike) are concrete and cost-lined. Interiority avoids label-speak; salt-etched skin and “eyes holding shifting greys” give embodied signature. No second character, so relationship crucible waived; isolation itself becomes pressure. Endurance of the wave-harmonized raft is credible renunciation with felt weariness— Earned Stasis met.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s quiet drive and spiral-shell calling feel lived-in; the reed-whistle choice under heat shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“his fingers reading histories”), never drifting into label-speak. Mentor-loss motive cleanly powers every beat; the final cartographer-to-translator shift is earned. No contradictory impulses visible under pressure, so just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“cold and sharp” anger) and her micro-choice—photographing the hidden veritas—caps her arc with visible cost. The parallel-drawing method is declared, not dramatized in scene, so agency feels intellectual rather than pressured. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her competence is high but the emotional rationality trait never complicates or jeopardizes her, muting internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s surveyor-archeologist hybrid motive is concrete early and drives every beat; the stoic/sensitive duality is shown through tactile micro-choices (inkwell palmed for comfort, note pressed underwater). Internal contradiction is alive in scene, not summary: he measures decay while surrendering to it. The final self-burial of his own dream is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost. Minor over-articulation of motive in closing paragraph keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “dappled resolve” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—ink stamp, drawer probe, scroll claim—each a visible cost under blackout pressure; the interior contradiction between order and messy truth is embodied, not labeled. The only drag is a slight over-clarity in self-diagnosis (“she needed to readjust”) that momentarily tilts toward therapy-speak before re-anchoring in action. Overall, her competence–flaw balance and the final Earned Stasis (she will leave with disorder, not tidy index) feel earned and specific. Voice never flattens; stamp and salt scent recur as charged objects that foreclose the old path.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s grief-propelled origami drive is vivid and embodied; her interiority stays concrete through tactile paper folding and gem-rubbing. The detached-sentient-shadow is a bold flaw that compounds her ache, yet its pure-melancholy voice is declared not dramatized, so the “mistake” never pressures her on-page choices. Final crane-fleet reunion supplies visible cost and earned endurance, but the shadow’s re-merge is more symbolic than causal within her decision path.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s grief is rendered with visceral, embodied specificity; his “hunt” is never abstract. Micro-choices are few but strategic: placing the geode, initiating the pulse, enduring the blackout. One flaw: plateauing rather than deepening—after the overload he is merely “unmoving,” not shown re-weighing options. Still, the renunciation of the search is legible and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s “perpetually surprised” trait is stated repeatedly but never shown to alter a choice or cost him anything; interiority is mostly abstract (“felt a pull,” “sense of belonging”) rather than embodied. The matrix chip and star-data obsession drive every action, so motive stays coherent, yet no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes his goal, so the arc is flat. The pilgrim is pure witness, supplying no relational pressure; hence the “relationship as crucible” test is moot. The final feeling of “wholeness” is declared, not dramatized through a renunciation or visible loss, so the change feelsassumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—the watch hand “pulse[s] with silent accusation,” guilt “twist[s] her insides”—but the psychological arc leans on retrospective summary rather than in-scene contradiction. The final renunciation is earned, yet the brother’s death is reported not dramatized, softening the cost. Still, Elara’s flaw drives every beat and the voice stays specific to her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers worrying the drawer pull, the chest-tight memory—but the “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive is stated more than dramatized; the final lightness feels more declared than cost-earned, softening the change.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for star-navigation while clinging to a cracked compass—embodies a navigator whose flaw is dramatized, not labeled. The micro-choice to count utility poles while water roughens shows value hierarchy (survival > lineage) with cost (shame). Letting the compass sink after the wave is earned renunciation; laughter is credible irrational release. Emotional arc layers regret, defiant humor, and exhausted acceptance without tidy repair—Earned Stasis achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is evocative—“jaded wonder,” “delicately robust”—but emotion stays abstract; no bodily contradiction under pressure. The final beat lands because the baseball’s return forces memory and empathy simultaneously, yet prior beats merely label states (“he felt a fragile empathy growing”) without embodied friction. One decisive micro-choice—throwing the ball—has to carry the arc; more prior stakes-testing choices would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to human identity while surrendering it—are dramatized in the spice-crushing beats; her “paradoxically steady” interiority is embodied in the calm hand that grinds saffron while her bones literally hollow. The permanent loss of human form is foreshadowed by early bodily specificity (“skin… translucent as moonlight”) and paid for in the final image where she becomes “part of the whisper itself.” No stock epiphanies; the metamorphosis is experienced as sensory rupture, not explained. Voice remains distinct and solitary; no status dynamics tested, but interior hierarchy of values is legible: Kael > self-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s ache to “find where lost time accumulates” is vivid and embodied; her tactile ritual with saucer and tablecloth externalizes regret without label-speak. Interior contradiction is present—she clings to memory yet rushes childhood—but no second on-page character forces status choices, so the “relationships as crucible” bullet is moot. The final act of weaving the thread into cloth feels earned because the traced-hand custom was seeded early. Still, the moment of pressing her palm to her mother’s print could show sharper micro-choice under cost rather than declarative surge.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s pacifism is interiorly alive—she refuses force even against metaphysical resistance—yet the story summarizes rather than dramatizes the hardest choices. The buoyancy micro-choice (suppressing joy to stay grounded) is a vivid embodied beat, but it stands alone; earlier shadow-work and final crossing are narrated rather than lived. We never feel her flinch or hesitate when the locked dimension pushes back, so the renunciation feels inferred, not earned. The character sings, but at novella length she would need more on-page forks where pacifism actually costs her something she could have seized by violence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but floats above embodied pressure; Elara’s “texture of transformation” desire is repeated but never sharpened by a micro-choice that costs her anything concrete. The final release is beautiful yet foregone; no contradictory impulse (keep one jar? sell them?) is dramatized, so renunciation feels preordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s calmly inventive trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—palming the quill, prying the panel—so we see contradiction-free action under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“the bronze quill holder felt heavy”) without label-speak. The arc is a credible renunciation: she accepts lifelong danger once the leaflets are planted, a cost foreshadowed by the “luminous stone” image. The single-POV lens is consistent; no secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s precognitive curse and mentor vow give immediate, embodied urgency; every micro-choice (adjusting one rock by a fraction) is a visible cost under auroral time-pressure. Interiority stays eel-herder specific: “visions twisted like eels in a net.” The final smile feels earned because the sequence of trembling, cursing, and numb fingers has already paid the emotional price. Flaw: the mentor remains off-page, so the “relationship crucible” bullet is inactive, capping the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s desire to “map scars” surfaces early and recurs, but the interior contradiction between fury and tranquility is asserted rather than dramatized; the micro-choice to hand the new poem over is present yet its causal link to her prior silencing is compressed into a single beat, so the cost feels moderate rather than acute. The censor-turned-ally arrival supplies external pressure but the status flip is stated, not staged, muting relationship-as-crucible. Motive coherence is solid; emotional embodiment hovers on the cusp of therapy-speak once (“furiously tranquil” repeated). Overall, strong spine, plausible change, but not yet razor-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—mechanical arm vs. organic hand, diplomatic poise vs. duelist aggression—is dramatized in gesture and micro-choice (needle insertion, sword offer). The “diplomatically fierce” trait costs him visible tension when the scroll is proffered instead of a thrust. The rival remains a silhouette, so status dynamics are thin, but Kaelen’s hierarchy of values (truth > victory) is legible in the final disarm. Mechanical arm as lived prosthetic is handled with tactile specificity; no competence over-claim.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s cyclical personality molting is introduced as a defining trait but never surfaces as a visible contradiction inside the scene; the only “micro-choice” under pressure is her tucking a poem into a book—mild. The friendship with Leo is tender yet static; no status shift or fresh pressure is negotiated between them. Interiority drifts toward lyrical paraphrase (“raw and renewed,” “luminous fracture”) rather than embodied cognition during the physical task of rebuilding. Because no hinge choice or renunciation is dramatized, the promised change at dawn feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s steely longing is embodied in the “cold fire” that refuses to be extinguished; his contradictory impulse to rewrite an unchangeable past is acted out through the micro-choice of threading the film while the compasses flare. Strategic creativity is dramatized: he calculates the chord sequence, tests the splice, and accepts the monochrome refuge at visible cost—his life’s palette reduced to black-and-white. The broken clock’s ghost-tick at the threshold is a charged gesture that forecloses return, earning the shift from nostalgic ache to active authorship. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from 9-band: no status crucible to further complicate his values.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation to safeguard collective memory is clear, yet her interiority stays generic (“luminous doubt” repeated rather than embodied). No contradictory impulses play out in-scene; decisions arrive fully formed via dream fiat, so agency feels external. Micro-choices are absent—she digs because the dream said so, not because she hesitates, second-guesses, or weighs risk. The arc lands at earned stasis, but the cost is stated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s regret is embodied in the “cerulean waters” pooling in his mind, a concrete, character-specific image that anchors his interiority. The micro-choice to walk the shore while holding the compass diffuses his intentions, aligning with Elian’s instruction and showing a visible shift from sharp pain to bearable ache. The final nod to Elian signals earned stasis: the path of silence is foreclosed, the cost is the permanent absence of the spoken apology to her, felt in the locket’s empty frame. The only lapse is a brief diagnostic label—“heart heavy with the weight of the severance”—but it is quickly overridden by sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation—stripping drama through scientific detachment—is vividly embodied in her fixation on dust patterns and decay, avoiding therapy-speak or abstraction. Her interiority is concrete: “preprocessed reality” manifests as patient observation, not just stated. The final humility feels earned through sustained micro-choices (not sweeping the speck, returning daily). However, her emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; it’s a quiet alignment rather than struggle, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—trembling hands, mental retracing, adaptive focus—but her emotional arc leans toward diagnostic self-awareness (“discover purpose in the pauses”) that edges into label-speak. Her motivation intensifies credibly from survival to creative reclamation, yet her transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; fear and resolve alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The rival artist reveal feels slightly convenient, though it aligns with established jealousy. Final choice to create rather than seek revenge is earned but borders on tidy moral clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile interactions with the tuning fork and heat-mapping, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her internal conflict—grief versus hope, silence versus music—is rendered through concrete sensory choices rather than abstraction. However, her emotional progression leans slightly toward tidy resolution (“harmonizing pain”) without sufficient friction or irrationality under stress. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a visible, costly trade-off that would push this into the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elijah’s inadvertent stubbornness and weariness are consistently embodied through micro-choices—refusing to retire, trembling hands during repair—and his emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak. His motivation deepens credibly from general duty to specific restoration, with visible cost in physical strain and isolation. However, the transition from land to submersible lacks a decisive interpersonal beat that would heighten interior contradiction under pressure. Final renunciation of lifelong solitude is implied but not dramatized as a foreclosed path with explicit sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in intergenerational care, and her “gentle persistence” manifests through micro-choices like organizing runs and ringing the bell. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels but occasionally leans on summary (“thoughts as heavy as the humid night air”). The elders and youth remain archetypal rather than individuated, though spatial choreography stays coherent. Her final declaration feels earned by prior action, with visible cost implied in sustained deprivation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in past-life yearning and spiritually curious traits that drive concrete action—reaching into the crevice, breathing to reveal light—but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; it leans toward epiphanic certainty rather than struggle. Her transformation feels earned through tactile engagement with the tear and breath, yet emotional complexity is smoothed into lyrical resolution without credible irrationality or hypocrisy. The final unity of “artist and healer” resonates but risks over-articulation (“no longer a pilgrim of sparks”) that borders on diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her obsession with time’s texture, and her internal conflict—between witnessing and altering the past—is embodied through tactile interactions with the halo fragment and maze. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“prison of shadows,” “slipping grip on reality”) rather than fully contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation feels earned, though the cost (fading photographs vanishing) registers more symbolically than viscerally. A tighter link between her flaw (retrocognitive passivity) and a concrete tactical error would elevate this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract (“spirit unbroken,” “unwavering hope”) rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or sensory perception under pressure. Her strategic patience is stated more than dramatized via micro-choices with cost. The guard confrontation lacks psychological friction—her calm feels like narrative fiat, not earned resilience. Chains symbolize liberation effectively, but emotional progression leans on metaphor over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s synesthesia and grief are vividly embodied, and her motivation—forged in personal betrayal—drives every action. However, her emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution; the shift from burden to lesson feels slightly abstract rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final insight about absences as potentials arrives with minimal internal resistance, softening the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to “press her ear against destiny’s door”—is compelling and consistent, driving high-stakes choices with emotional specificity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead using embodied sensation (“cold, metallic touch of destiny’s door”) to convey tension. The contradiction between caution and allure is active in-scene during the black orchid trap. However, her competence borders on frictionless; the final escape lacks a visible misstep that would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, thawing heart, and professional ritual feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (selecting cobalt glass, keeping the flawed sphere) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“thaw within her”) rather than messy contradiction, softening the edge of authenticity just enough to prevent a 9+. The cracked bookmark functions more as symbol than catalyst for internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s phobias are embodied rather than labeled, and his micro-choices—kneeling steadily despite inner tremor, using fear as a lens for decryption—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The betrayal by Silas is emotionally credible, though Eli’s role borders on instrumentalized archetype. Interiority avoids diagnostic self-awareness, yet the epiphany about vulnerability verges on articulation that real-time crisis rarely permits. Still, the final confrontation earns its emotional weight through consistent behavioral logic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Oracle’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her past and present solitude, yet her interiority lacks contradictory impulses—her “mild obsession” reads as singular focus without internal friction. Emotions are embodied through tactile details (gold leaf on fingers, chill in bones), but the absence of struggle beyond endurance limits depth. Her final Earned Stasis is credible, though the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally felt. No secondary characters dilute focus, but the lack of any internal conflict beyond devotion weakens full characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    J-7’s motivation is clear and consistent—its quest for the origin of thought drives every action—but interiority leans slightly abstract in key moments (e.g., “burning curiosity” borders on label-speak). The robot’s micro-choices (guarding the violin, returning nightly) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost: isolation, fragility, temporal dislocation. Its composed demeanor contrasts effectively with internal urgency, though emotional embodiment remains more conceptual than visceral. Final renunciation isn’t dramatized as loss, slightly softening the earnedness of its insight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire for transparency, compelling her to act despite social cost. Her interiority is concrete (“hoping the forecourt's echoes would reveal what daylight conversations had concealed”) and embodied through quiet observation and meticulous analysis. Marco’s guilt-driven emergence feels earned, though his emotional shift leans slightly tidy. The final nod conveys mutual understanding without over-explanation, preserving character integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—rooted in her belief that care, not luck, shapes the garden—but her interiority remains largely abstract, expressed through thematic assertion rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The “wisely pragmatic” trait functions more as a label than a lived tension; we see no internal struggle between effort and doubt, only affirmation. Her actions align with motive, yet lack the friction of genuine risk or error. The final renunciation of measurable luck feels earned thematically but not dramatized through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—proving time moves sideways—is consistent and quietly obsessive, embodied in his focused actions and contrasted against the station’s clinical detachment. Dr. Aris’s shift from skepticism to warmth feels earned through shared witnessing rather than exposition. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; Kael experiences no doubt or friction beyond external time pressure. The absence of struggle or blind spots makes his epiphany feel frictionless, undercutting emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her obsession with the ghost composer, and intensifies credibly through embodied choices—wading through water, interpreting stains, slapping the surface. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains grounded in sensory perception. The final act of disruption feels earned by prior micro-choices, though the ghost’s silent approval leans slightly toward convenient validation rather than struggle-born insight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—sweat, throbbing head, unsteady legs—and her contradictions (certainty vs. doubt, data vs. intuition) drive micro-choices like unpining the illustration. The swallowed truth emerges organically from fevered memory rather than exposition. However, her transformation leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“fault-tolerant oracle… embracing errors”) without sufficient struggle in-scene. Final acceptance feels earned but borders on tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his skepticism, exhaustion, and obsession with “swallowed truth” shape every perception and micro-choice. His final act of placing the valve back demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost: the burden of history now carried outward. However, his emotional shift from drowsy alertness to clarity lacks sufficient friction; the transition feels slightly too smooth for a man defined by hardened doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—to witness change without judgment—is consistent and embodied through their interaction with the swan and refuge. However, their interiority leans toward abstract epiphany (“beauty in collapse,” “eternity in decay”) without sufficient contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The character endures rather than decides, which fits Earned Stasis, but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses a concrete path. Their flaw—detachment—is stated more than dramatized through action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and emotionally grounded, but her interiority leans toward abstract sentiment rather than embodied contradiction. Leo’s transformation feels earned yet lacks friction—his shift from withdrawn to awestruck occurs without visible resistance or cost. The baby hair curl functions more as a symbolic prop than a catalyst shaped by character choice. Still, the therapist’s cautious exuberance and adaptive ethos reflect a coherent, if gently rendered, hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his sensitively perceptive nature, and his actions—tracing tapestry threads, calibrating a listening device—are consistent with his sacred duty. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied perception (“fingers traced… feeling not cloth but resonance”). However, the absence of contradictory impulses or meaningful resistance flattens emotional complexity; his path is unimpeded, reducing cost to atmospheric rather than personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara and Leo lack interior contradiction; their motivations are stated but not dramatized through embodied conflict. The “accidentally prophetic” trait is asserted without showing its burden or cost in-scene. Their transformation from isolation to purpose feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional states remain abstract (“heart racing,” “felt confined”) without sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Father Elian’s motivation is singular and consistent, his actions tightly aligned with his goal to “illuminate hidden assumptions.” His interiority is concrete—embodied through ritual acts (thumb in paint, loop pedal use)—not abstract. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses; he operates with near-perfect competence under pressure, missing internal friction that would deepen credibility. Final renunciation of silence feels earned but costless, undermining emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—chronological homesickness fused with a desire to conduct “unheard symphonies”—is vividly embodied through sensory-rich memory mapping. Her internal contradiction (yearning for the past while racing against exhaustion) manifests in concrete micro-choices: tracing shell segments, notating rustling wheat as percussion. Emotion is consistently rendered through tactile perception rather than diagnostic labels. However, her transformation at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior friction between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and intensifies through micro-choices—tracing runes, rejecting the eternally young self—that reveal a hierarchy of values. His internal conflict (defiance vs. integration) acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation (“to simply be”) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: each integration “felt like a part of him dying.” However, interiority occasionally leans into diagnostic phrasing (“periodically eternal,” “fractured reflections”) that borders on label-speak without fully embodying the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—longing for sound yet finding music in silence—is embodied through tactile sensation and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the needle into clay). Her transformation feels earned, not epiphanic, and Kael’s presence applies subtle pressure without overshadowing her arc. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in physicality (“vibrations etched patterns of feeling into her soul”). However, Kael’s motivation remains underexplored, slightly weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—nurturing integrity through storm recording—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving her to investigate despite fear. Her interiority is concrete (“pulse still quick,” “hands steadied”), though some emotional states verge on label-like (“credibly curious mind itching”). The shift from solitude to collaboration feels earned, with visible cost in relinquishing isolation. However, the follower-turned-ally’s sudden trust lacks sufficient friction or contradiction in Elara’s response.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her caution around scents, grief over her mother, and professional identity converge in the climactic moment with the vial and blossom. Her contradictory impulses (avoiding vs. embracing scent) act simultaneously under pressure, and her final acceptance feels earned. However, the emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“she realized the pollen carried imprints…”) rather than purely dramatized discovery, nudging it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied—his “ethically playful” nature manifests in moral irony rather than label-speak, and his contradictory impulses (freedom vs. responsibility, memory vs. sacrifice) act simultaneously during the climax. His choice feels earned through tactile engagement with the rope and layered reflection that tilts present action. The cost—erasure of personal history—is viscerally rendered in the final emptiness. Minor deduction: slight over-articulation in “texture of time” concept risks abstraction, but remains grounded by sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is compellingly rooted in loss and sensory acuity, and her micro-choices (e.g., building the bonfire, unbinding echoes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains embodied through sound, silence, and tactile ritual. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; grief and resilience alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting silence as companion—feels earned but slightly abstracted from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly rooted in a desire to fuse insight with empathy, and her transformation feels earned through sensory-triggered realization. However, the epiphany leans on diagnostic phrasing (“genuine empathy, fusing with her sharp insight”) that borders on therapy-speak during a peak beat, slightly undercutting embodied contradiction. Her micro-choice—dropping the blotter petal—is resonant but lacks visible cost beyond symbolic gesture. Interiority remains consistent, though emotional progression resolves too tidily into harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent but lacks internal contradiction; her shift from profit-driven broker to compassion advocate feels smooth rather than earned through struggle. Anya remains a vessel for theme, not a pressurized counterpart. The locket return catalyzes change without meaningful resistance or cost to Elara’s prior identity. Emotional progression leans toward tidy uplift rather than layered, flawed humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “boldly sympathetic” nature and yearning for kinship. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak and is embodied through tactile interactions with reeds and stone. However, the transformation from isolation to belonging lacks a visible internal contradiction or struggle under pressure—her acceptance feels smooth rather than earned through friction. The absence of a meaningful flaw or misstep weakens the credibility of her integration.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as an illustrator seeking understanding, not power. Her internal conflict—patience versus haste—is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., sculpting time despite cost). The aging consequence feels earned, though the emotional arc leans slightly tidy. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and her flaw (self-sacrifice) directly enables the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, and his interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, his emotional shift at the climax—moving from desperation to acceptance—relies slightly on abstract realization (“mathematics of emotion was not about eliminating loss”) rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice feels earned but lacks a micro-action that visibly forecloses a prior path; cost is conceptual, not tactile. His gently inventive trait informs method but doesn’t generate meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is consistent and rooted in his identity as a guardian of memory, and his “kindly methodical” nature informs every action. However, internal contradiction is minimal—his choices lack friction or competing impulses, flattening emotional complexity. The sense memory functions more as sentimental trigger than a site of psychological tension. Final renunciation (slipping back into shadows) feels earned but untested by meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict—between control and surrender—is rendered with embodied specificity (e.g., “uncurled her fingers,” “circuitously sincere” monologues) and evolves through micro-choices under storm pressure. Her transformation avoids diagnostic label-speak, though the epiphany leans slightly tidy. The cost of relinquishing mastery is felt in her silence and changed posture toward the tree. A near-flawless single-POV arc marred only by a faint whiff of thematic convenience in the final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s wry earnestness and insomnia-driven clarity feel specific and embodied, not diagnostic. His motivation—to “thresh meaning from experience”—is dramatized through tactile actions (tracing riverbeds, pocketing the brooch) rather than stated as insight. The exchange with Elara reveals a hierarchy of values: connection over isolation, story over possession. However, his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—his cynicism and sincerity alternate rather than collide in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and pure, driving her actions credibly, but Kaelen’s internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—he shifts from unsettled to accepting without sufficient friction. Their choices align with stated motives, yet emotional progression leans tidy, especially in Kaelen’s sudden realization about “unseen” necessity. The pilgrim’s trembling reach for the pearl shows micro-choice under pressure, though interiority occasionally defaults to lyrical summary over concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as an archivist navigating absences, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her resolve feels linear rather than fraught. Her micro-choices (e.g., returning at dawn/dusk) reveal values, yet emotional embodiment leans toward lyrical abstraction over visceral contradiction. The final act of speaking unamplified carries quiet cost, but the absence of tangible personal sacrifice limits the depth of earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and compelling, rooted in her “analytically artistic” nature, and her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices—interpreting cracks, using the punch—are character-specific and reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves with unwavering focus, reducing emotional complexity. The transformation feels earned but leans toward tidy resolution rather than layered struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s sympathetic skepticism and motivation to offer solace are consistent and embodied, especially in her tactile interaction with the tile and her decision to invite villagers despite doubt. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—she shifts cleanly from skeptic to believer without messy resistance. The “courageously kind” trait is asserted more than dramatized through costly trade-offs; her act carries emotional weight but no tangible sacrifice. Final choice feels earned by vision rather than struggle, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation—boredom so profound it seeks the unknowable “after goodbye”—is consistent, embodied, and drives every action. His internal contradiction (eternal life vs. desire for finality) manifests physically through his handling of the amulet and his navigation of folding space. The climax reveals awe replacing boredom, a credible emotional shift earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through prismatic light, magnetic hum, and spatial unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s internal conflict—honesty versus inherited deceit—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (polishing caskets, handling the ink pot) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. His micro-choices (refusing his father’s tricks, using the pot ethically) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: isolation, moral burden, and emotional restraint. The security chief’s shift feels earned because Leo’s appeal targets a specific vulnerability (“hidden doubts”), not generic persuasion. However, the father remains off-page and underdeveloped, slightly weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his identity as a collector of temporal textures, and his earnestly studious nature manifests through precise actions and embodied focus. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped—his impulses are consistent but not conflicted, limiting emotional complexity. The final renunciation (continuing his eternal cycle) feels earned by prior behavior but lacks a visible cost beyond implied solitude. His character remains compelling yet slightly idealized, without a flaw that actively complicates his mission.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to recover the texture of stolen memories—is compellingly embodied through sensory and emotional specificity, especially in his tactile handling of overheard fragments. His internal contradiction (craving identity yet defined by erasure) intensifies credibly, culminating in a resonant self-recognition that forecloses anonymity with palpable cost. However, the final realization leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“bitter taste of arsenic on his lips”) that borders on label-speak, though it’s grounded by prior sensory buildup. No secondary characters exert meaningful pressure, but the single-POV scope justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile interactions with the seashell, cello, and compass, revealing contradictory impulses—sorrow and joy, completion and incompleteness—without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (plucking strings, holding the shell to her ear) enact her reevaluation of truth as process, not destination. The mentor Alistair exists only in memory, so relationship dynamics are internalized effectively. However, her epiphany leans slightly toward articulation (“the riddle is you”) without sufficient prior friction to fully earn the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—dual allegiance to community and corporate progress—is embodied in her tactile rituals (rubbing the stone chip) and micro-choices (painting coded graffiti). Her orderly intuition manifests in precise planning yet intuitive execution, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The child-watcher moment subtly reveals her hope without sentimentality. However, the final renunciation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional weight, slightly undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her purposeful curiosity drives concrete actions like calibrating chemical vials and framing the shot with scientific precision. Her interiority is embodied through tactile details (the warm sand grain, suit hum) rather than abstract labels. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness, showing grief through ritualized behavior. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile and sensory perception, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation—decoding feedback into navigational direction—is consistent and intensifies under time pressure. However, her choices lack contradictory impulses; she moves with serene certainty, which softens internal conflict. The absence of struggle or error in her repair process undercuts the “genuine struggle” benchmark for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s dry wit and intellectual obsession feel specific and embodied, especially in his tactile interaction with the phrasebook and condensation. His internal contradiction—between scholarly certainty and existential doubt—is dramatized through micro-choices (tracing droplets, stepping onto the ice) rather than summarized. The nagging worry post-revelation avoids tidy resolution, preserving moral and emotional ambiguity. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle against his own limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire to restore balance, but his interiority remains abstract rather than embodied—emotions are stated (“infinite patience”) rather than dramatized through contradiction or physical sensation. His choices lack visible trade-offs; the cost of failure is implied but never felt in micro-decisions. The character functions more as an archetype than an individual with specific limits or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular and consistent, his internal conflict between panic and calm rendered through embodied tension (“gloved hand,” “alarm chirped its final warning”). His micro-choices—gentle twist over force—reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. However, his emotional arc lacks contradiction; he moves from resolve to triumph without credible self-deception or irrationality. The vial-guided memory-touch feels slightly convenient, softening the struggle’s authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation—redemption through truth—is consistent and embodied in micro-choices: whispering lies, recalling honesty, using the lattice as both tool and talisman. His internal conflict (legacy vs. agency) manifests simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of escape for earned stasis feels rooted in his father’s regret, though the emotional cost lacks a sharper on-page wound beyond atmospheric calm.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ghost bride’s motivation—repaying a cross-lifetime debt—is clear and consistent, and Elian’s mournful elation embodies contradictory impulses credibly. However, interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“lovingly venomous,” “mournful elation”) rather than embodied sensation under pressure. The final choice—to accept the bead—is earned, but the emotional cost is stated more than dramatized in physical detail. Strong characterization overall, yet lacks granular micro-choices that would push it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and consistent, rooted in poetic identity and reverence for ruin. Her interiority is vividly embodied through tactile actions (“sew,” “pulling an invisible thread”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradiction or struggle—she moves with unwavering certainty, diminishing tension. The absence of internal conflict or blind spots prevents the final act from feeling earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in diasporic longing, but her interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Her "warmly curious" trait is named more than dramatized through costly choices. The decision to rebuild the sundial feels spiritually resonant but lacks friction—no competing impulse or tangible sacrifice challenges her resolve. Final renunciation of the orchard reads as earned, yet the emotional cost remains atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire to uncover hidden truths, but her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“deep-seated need,” “futuristic nostalgia”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her actions align with her role, yet emotional stakes feel intellectualized, not viscerally felt. The pseudonym “Orion Black” and chalk codes reveal professional competence but lack personal cost or flaw-driven tension. A credible endurance is shown, but the absence of internal conflict beyond duty limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her needlework, posture shifts, and sensory focus reveal her dual nature without exposition. Her contradiction (wisdom masked as foolishness) drives micro-choices under pressure, especially when she drops the needle to feign incompetence. The final blow-out of the candle is a credible renunciation earned by prior tension, with clear cost: exposure and loss of sanctuary. However, her emotional degradation under stress is slightly muted—more physical tells would heighten realism.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “knot of unsent letters,” the shard’s pulse against her palm—and her contradictions (fierce need vs. protective tenderness) drive micro-choices that feel earned. The final renunciation of the letters as self-liberation avoids epiphany cliché by grounding it in tactile ritual (evoking words as release). However, Kaelen remains an off-page abstraction; his “courage failed here” reads as convenient revelation rather than dramatized discovery, slightly weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied emotion and a compelling paradox (“shrewdly innocent”) that informs her motivation. Her micro-choices—deciphering Kaito’s notes—are consistent with her identity as a translator of trauma, not just language. However, the final decryption lacks concrete action; it occurs entirely in drugged reverie, weakening the causal link between motive and outcome. The “lotus-hearted ache” risks tipping into diagnostic label-speak but is grounded by the coral’s tactile presence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rediscovering joy—is embodied through tactile interaction with the fresco fragment and light-painting, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her internal contradiction (longing vs. resignation) manifests in micro-choices: brushing grime, applying algae, stepping back. The knowledge network is underutilized as pressure, but her solitary agency remains credible. Final warmth feels earned, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation evolves credibly from restorer to reawakener, grounded in her “methodically playful” trait and embodied reactions to the hobo nickel. Her internal conflict—certainty vs. curiosity—is shown through micro-choices (tapping the coin, chanting, tossing it) rather than stated. However, the final shift leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient struggle; the cost of abandoning restoration expertise is implied but not viscerally felt. Still, her arc aligns tightly with the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—defiance against cognitive taxation—is vividly embodied in her actions and speech, especially her use of riddles and the gourd rattle. Her interiority remains consistent and character-specific, with micro-choices (e.g., scattering seeds under pressure) revealing her hierarchy of values. However, secondary characters lack individuation; their dialogue converges into functional urgency without distinct voice or status dynamics. The absence of internal contradiction beyond steadfast defiance slightly flattens emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s motivation is vividly rendered but remains static; his "shyly unstoppable" trait functions more as lyrical label than embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values—his actions repeat without escalation or cost until the ending’s passive receipt of distant echoes. Emotional embodiment leans on metaphor (“reef-shadow joy”) rather than physical sensation, risking therapy-speak. The final “rest” lacks prior struggle that would make it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—“foxglove regret” colors her actions with bittersweet specificity, and her micro-choices (ascending the spire, scanning archives “with gently systematic precision”) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to preservation. Her motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, though her emotional contradiction remains subtle rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses. The final renunciation—relief tempered by regret—is earned and carries visible cost. However, her struggle lacks a moment of genuine error or misjudgment; competence slightly outweighs vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to mend trust through concrete action. Her interiority shows embodied emotion—trembling hands, cautious exuberance—and micro-choices (e.g., writing increasingly vulnerable promises) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, Kaelen’s late entrance limits relational dynamics; his presence feels reactive rather than co-constitutive of the conflict. The “carefully reckless” trait is named but not dramatized as a lived contradiction with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—harmonizing civic pragmatism and historical reverence—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices like leaving “subtle adjustments” unnoticed by inspectors. Her internal contradiction (doubt vs. determination) manifests physically (“hands shook, but she pressed on”) without diagnostic self-awareness. The ancestral chain and hidden message deepen her arc credibly, though the final emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. Flaws are present but not safety-hedged; her competence is balanced by genuine tension with the breathing structure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior conflict—between self-protection and longing for connection—is embodied through micro-choices (curt replies, edited confessions) and anchored in concrete behavior (training pigeons, mapping dust). Her reinvented history feels psychologically credible, though the emotional progression leans slightly tidy in the resolution. Leo functions effectively as a crucible, but his role borders on idealized support rather than fully pressurizing her flaws. The meteorite chip and lost songs compellingly tie motive to action, yet the betrayal backstory remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her father’s maze and the pilgrims’ awe, and her “featherly determined” resolve feels embodied rather than labeled. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she intuits, analyzes, and understands without resistance or missteps. The absence of struggle or flawed perception undercuts emotional realism, especially for a child navigating metaphysical chaos. Her transformation into “architect of her own path” feels earned thematically but not psychologically.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply felt, rooted in her search for belonging through cosmic rhythm. Her interiority is concrete—feeling the feather’s fragility, recalling Dr. Aris—but her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“she realized that the rhythm of belonging was not about geographic location”) rather than embodied contradiction. The burnt feather catalyzes reflection more than active choice, limiting micro-decisions under pressure. Still, her final epiphany feels earned through sensory immersion and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poignant desire to preserve vanishing memories. His interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“cheerful gloom,” “pang of cheerful gloom”) and micro-choices (using crater glass, nurturing seeds). However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—his resolve rarely wavers, flattening tension. The final renunciation feels earned but leans on conceptual insight over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through concrete habits (chalk-stained fingers, bishop piece) and a consistent worldview that frames her actions. Her analytical nature drives every choice, and the tension between control and wonder feels authentic. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she never wavers or falters under pressure, reducing emotional complexity. The final renunciation of anonymity is implied but not dramatized with personal cost beyond aesthetic fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in resistance to the nostalgia ban, and her internal conflict—between exile and purpose—is embodied through ritualistic action. However, her emotional state remains largely abstracted (“burned within her,” “felt a surge of power”) without concrete contradiction or degradation under stress. The transformation feels earned but leans on lyrical assertion over micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her flaw (defiance) enables rather than complicates her success, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, grounded in tactile perception and professional identity. Her motivation—to illuminate value in the mundane—is embodied through micro-choices (selecting the pebble, casting it) rather than stated abstraction. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves smoothly from unease to clarity without struggle or misstep, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of genuine flaw or blind spot undercuts the “flawed but credible” benchmark for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied sensation and concrete memory, particularly in her tactile relationship with the porcelain box and scars. Her motivation—to translate pain into universal language—is consistent and tied to past trauma. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; grief and resolve alternate rather than collide. The “bargained innocence” concept feels more thematic than psychologically active in present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“brass cool against her skin,” “gentle warming in the air”) and consistent with her “logical dreamer” identity. Her micro-choices—adjusting stone patterns in response to gauge readings—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on compassion-as-method. However, internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized; we see no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, only serene execution. The absence of struggle or blind spots slightly undermines the credibility of her flawless efficacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—discovering what walls dream about—is vividly embodied and deepens credibly upon encountering the diaries and film. Her perceptive trait drives concrete actions (kneeling, extracting, interpreting), and her final choice to carry the burden feels earned. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told she feels guilt and hope, but don’t witness simultaneous opposing impulses under pressure. The emotional arc is resonant but leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a mirage painter who seeks to reveal possibilities. Her interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices—tracing stone, humming lullabies, guiding light—yet lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she operates with near-perfect competence. The borrowed heartbeat concept adds emotional texture but doesn’t generate genuine conflict or error. Final renunciation (slipping away) feels earned but carries minimal visible cost beyond transience.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, but her interiority leans on abstract labels like “price of redemption” rather than embodied contradiction. Her gentleness feels more asserted than enacted under pressure. The sacrifice is noble but lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values—she simply accepts death without visible struggle. Flaws are mentioned (“past mistakes”) but not dramatized as active impediments during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—amoral yet secretly sentimental—is embodied in his fractured grace and the ritual with the egg, avoiding diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to kneel and release the echo despite his own rational objections reveals a hierarchy of buried values. The cost is felt in his slumped shoulders and cracked armor, not stated. His flaw directly enables and complicates the central act, making the renunciation credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to defy conformity, and her internal conflict between resignation and liberation is rendered with poetic restraint. However, her transformation leans on abstract epiphanies (“rewriting the poetry of her being”) rather than concrete, embodied choices under pressure. The final act feels earned thematically but lacks micro-decisions that visibly foreclose prior paths. Her chaste courtesan identity informs tone more than tactical behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her commitment to ethical storytelling, and her internal conflict between subversion and accessibility feels authentic. However, her emotional progression leans toward diagnostic self-awareness (“ethical storytelling wasn’t just about subversion but about honoring complexity”) that reads more like thematic articulation than embodied crisis. Her serenity remains a trait rather than a tested constraint—no visible cost arises from it. The lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (e.g., wanting both to provoke and to be accepted) flattens her interiority at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his grief over ecological loss manifests in ritual action, not exposition. His internal contradiction (desire to preserve vs. acceptance of transience) plays out in the knotting and untying of the wing. The final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost in his solitude and tears. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized stoicism rather than messy humanity, softening the flaw depth required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving forgotten names—is clear, consistent, and rooted in personal history. Her interiority is embodied through tactile detail (“fingers working with a caster’s patience”) and emotional specificity (“snowmelt ardor”). However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; forgiveness is stated but not dramatized as an active struggle. The absence of genuine resistance or competing desires softens the cost of her resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Foresight Hindsight only’s motivation is vividly rooted in her decaying directive and dual perception, driving her toward a resonant renunciation. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile rituals (arranging dream-stones) and sensory immersion. The final choice—to step into the storm—is earned by prior causality: her precise playfulness enables the interpretive breakthrough that dissolves the seal. However, the epiphany arrives with slight ease; the “resonance” revelation lacks struggle or misstep, softening the cost of transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s frugality and empirical rigor are consistently embodied in action (patched robe, reused schematics) and drive his methodical search. His internal contradiction—evidence-based mind embracing ritual—is credibly rendered without diagnostic label-speak. The final choice to “seal the covenant” feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his relinquishing of the tile. However, his emotional arc leans slightly tidy; the epiphany about “devotion in the seeking itself” risks bordering on unearned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” duality is conceptually intriguing but under-embodied; her manipulation lacks tangible micro-choices or internal contradiction, rendering her more archetype than individual. Kael’s transformation hinges on exposition (“cellular memory,” “shifting grace”) rather than dramatized struggle, making his emotional shift feel unearned. The story tells us their motivations clearly but doesn’t show the friction of competing impulses in real time. Final change reads as imposed by narrative convenience, not forged through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his craft and dream, with consistent interiority and micro-choices (e.g., grounding himself, crafting the final mirror). Lyra functions as a calm counterweight but lacks individuated voice or pressure beyond support—still acceptable under Track A defaults. The “firmly grounded” trait informs action and cost, though internal contradiction remains subtle rather than simultaneous. Final renunciation of the full dream for a captured fragment shows credible endurance with tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s feisty integrity and maternal longing are embodied through tactile actions (wrapping the ribbon, polishing quartz) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her epiphany about “deciduous vows” is earned via her mother’s journal, not abstract reflection. However, Lyra’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient on-page pressure to fully justify her off-stage transformation—her change feels more narrated than dramatized. The final embrace carries emotional weight but leans slightly on sentiment over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—driven by a “cold star” of curiosity—is vividly embodied and escalates credibly from bewilderment to awakened resolve. Her internal conflict between desire for forbidden knowledge and fear of self-unraveling is rendered through concrete choices (demanding answers, returning the cameo) rather than abstract introspection. The two bathroom breakthroughs risk epiphany-as-convenience but are grounded in tactile cues (reflection, steam) and lead to distinct micro-choices that alter her stance. Final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost: she accepts curation over conquest, foreclosing possession of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait manifests through concrete micro-choices—decoding the diary, cross-referencing catalogs, shifting to meditation—that align with her linguistic expertise and internal calm. Kael’s impatience contrasts effectively, but his arc leans slightly on exposition rather than embodied struggle. The pivotal renunciation—reframing rescue as confrontation—is earned by prior causality. However, Kael’s internal shift lacks granular contradiction under pressure, softening the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied contradiction—“blissfully aberrant” yet yearning for wholeness—but her motivation leans slightly abstract, and the chimera twin backstory borders on diagnostic label-speak (“dual DNA that made her a discoverer”) without fully dramatizing its emotional cost until the end. The final renunciation feels earned, though the “absorbed twin” concept risks conceptual neatness over visceral struggle. Micro-choices (sitting on the carousel, whispering names) reveal hierarchy of values, but some beats summarize internal states rather than enact them.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation (“translate confusion into clarity”) is embodied through precise, tactile actions—untwisting braids, pressing wax—that reveal her interiority without exposition. Her “warmly methodical” nature drives every choice with consistent logic and emotional restraint. The final renunciation isn’t of a person but of ambiguity itself, foreclosing the void with visible cost: the rope’s inertness, the ghost’s sigh. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in quill, grain, and tick.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as mapkeeper, and her struggle against dissonance feels embodied through tactile interactions with ice and stone. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward resolution without hesitation or self-doubt that would deepen psychological realism. The absence of genuine missteps or flawed judgment undercuts the "hammered" quality of her repose. Her endurance is credible but borders on competence without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—proving coincidences have meaning—is rooted in consistent, character-specific traits and intensifies credibly through her retrocognitive visions. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“hope, thin as a dandelion clock”) and tied to micro-choices (aligning prism fragments using brass instruments). The final act earns its emotional weight through prior struggle, with visible cost in the “shard of hush” that nearly swallows her hope. No safety-hedging: her belief is fragile yet tenacious, making her endurance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s preemptive nostalgia and drive to “sculpt identity from experience” are vividly embodied through precise micro-choices—measuring shadows, listening to crystal whispers—and yield a credible internal shift. His contradictory impulses (mourning the fog before it hardens, yet seeking meaning in its solid state) operate simultaneously, avoiding tidy resolution. However, his epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic articulation (“identity wasn’t carved from solitary events…”) without sufficient prior struggle to fully earn the insight as non-epiphanic. Still, the final stillness feels lived-in, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—to defy hopelessness through “serious play”—is vividly embodied in his ritualized actions and internal chant, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. His micro-choices (igniting the rag, reading the mosaic) reveal a hierarchy of values: transformation over preservation, ephemeral beauty over permanence. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he moves with near-unbroken conviction, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of genuine struggle or blind spots makes his mastery feel unearned, despite strong voice and consistent interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s warmly observant nature is embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., turning from Kael to study the crab), revealing a hierarchy of values that prioritizes indirect understanding over confrontation. Her motivation—to discover the texture of time—is consistent and drives her actions, though Kael remains underdeveloped as a pressure source rather than a fully realized counterpoint. The final renunciation (“not let go, but transform”) feels earned through prior behavior, yet lacks a visible cost beyond emotional shift. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels but occasionally leans into lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia, doll attachment, and silence-collecting obsession form a coherent, embodied psychology that drives every choice. Her internal contradiction—fear of confinement versus terror of open sky—is rendered in tactile detail (“stomach lurching,” “clutched her doll”). The final renunciation (returning to the bunker) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost: she trades freedom for survival. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her desire to "teach silence how to comfort," and her trait of being "fluidly logical" informs her methodical use of the storm glass. However, her interiority remains largely abstract—emotions are named ("deep satisfaction," "warm and full of potential") rather than embodied through specific sensory or physical detail. The lack of internal contradiction or struggle flattens her arc; she executes her purpose without friction or doubt. Her final choice feels earned but costless, undermining emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; her “wisely adventurous” trait functions as label rather than lived tension. She executes tasks efficiently without meaningful error, doubt, or cost that complicates her choices. The ruby flake guides her unerringly, reducing genuine risk. Her emotional arc relies on summary (“heart heavy with futuristic nostalgia”) rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s motivation—to teach suffocating to breathe—is compelling and embodied through tactile choices (hovering near the ring, inviting shared breath). His internal contradiction (desiring solitude yet recognizing connection through scars) is consistent and layered. However, his transformation lacks a decisive micro-choice with visible cost; the shift feels lyrical rather than earned by prior causality. Final renunciation or endurance isn’t crystallized with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s motivation—transforming trauma into value—is vividly embodied through his tactile relationship with the porthole bolt and his “virtuously mischievous” agency during the climax. His internal contradiction (desire for escape vs. need to confront pressure) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The backstory of the pyramid scheme is economically anchored via present stimuli (the bolt, the farm), and his final choice feels earned by prior causality. However, the emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy; his clarity borders on diagnostic self-awareness during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; his epiphany arrives without credible resistance or flawed misbelief. The transformation from “dynasty ender” to “healer” feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Emotions remain abstract (“haunted,” “determined”) without sensory grounding or irrational complexity. His silence reads as aesthetic rather than character-bound limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sir Alaric’s withdrawn nature and yearning for possibility are embodied through tactile choices—removing his vambrace, tracing strings—and internal contradictions (knight turned mystic). His motivation intensifies credibly, culminating in a renunciation of past regrets that forecloses his former self with felt cost. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“unsnap from the chains of his past regrets”) rather than messy, character-bound struggle. The final transformation feels earned but borders on tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her grief over a failed adoption fuels her meticulous, hopeful archiving. Her micro-choices (handling dust veils, cross-referencing records) reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving kindness over bureaucratic order. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; her hope remains fragile, not triumphant. However, her transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany when linking Jonah’s teaching career to the button without on-page evidence of that discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear but interiority remains abstract, relying on labels like “carefully resourceful” and “tyranny of indifference” without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His actions align with his goal, yet emotional states are summarized (“felt desperation,” “surge of coded freedom”) rather than dramatized through sensory or behavioral specificity. The final endurance lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path—his key feels “lighter,” undercutting sacrifice. No secondary characters appear to test relationships or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in generational duty, and his emotional burden is embodied through tactile details like dewdrops on the saxophone. However, his internal conflict remains largely summarized (“eerie nostalgia,” “weight of his task”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The memory of his teacher functions as reflection, not a micro-choice that alters present action. His endurance is credible but lacks a decisive renunciation with visible cost beyond atmospheric sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation evolves from curiosity to sacred duty, but her internal contradiction remains underdeveloped—she shifts seamlessly without resistance or struggle. Her orderly nature is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal tension between control and chaos. The transformation feels earned thematically but lacks embodied friction or visible cost in pivotal moments. No genuine flaw complicates her path; competence outweighs struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile detail and embodied contradiction—her “uncertainly certain” state feels authentic, not diagnostic. Her shift from rigid control to improvisational trust emerges organically from micro-choices (e.g., stepping out without an itinerary, brushing dirt to find the key). The flaw lies in the near-instantaneous transformation; her epiphany at the grotto lacks sufficient struggle or setback to fully earn the depth of change implied. Still, her final stance—valuing flow over fixation—resonates as credible endurance with visible cost: the surrender of her old identity as a fixer of broken time.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding the weight of a name—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies into high-stakes action (fracturing the coin). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile ritual (kintsugi mending) and precise alchemical labor. The contradiction between her pride in equilibrium and her need to break the coin drives credible escalation. Final renunciation (accepting brokenness as redemption) is earned with visible cost: the fractured artifact, now transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to integrate laughter into healing—is consistent and shapes her actions, but her interiority remains abstract ("modestly fearless heart," "luminous ache") without embodied contradiction or struggle. Her choices follow a predictable arc with minimal friction or cost; the resolution feels earned more by ritual than personal transformation. The label “modestly fearless” is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation—discovering the “mathematics of mercy”—is deeply rooted in trauma and consistently drives his perception and micro-choices. His proprioceptive enhancement and trauma responses are embodied, not diagnostic, and avoid therapy-speak. The final realization feels earned because it emerges from repeated bracing rituals and sensory feedback, not abstraction. His gaunt reflection and phantom strap ground his psychological state in physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is consistent and embodied through her tactile engagement with the lens fragment and painting. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, relying instead on sensory intuition (“elusively tangible,” “anchors of intuition”). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves seamlessly from purpose to revelation without internal friction or doubt that would deepen credibility under pressure. The absence of struggle or misstep makes her competence feel unearned, flattening the cost of her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “weightless burden” and observational habits feel embodied, not diagnostic. His motivation to uncover hidden truths aligns with his actions, and the ghostly encounters compel higher-stakes choices without over-explaining. However, the emotional arc leans slightly tidy: his shift from duty to pride lacks friction or contradictory impulses in-scene. The final choice feels earned but not wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is vividly embodied through her tactile interactions with the whisper, frost, and press. Her internal contradiction (desire for control vs. embrace of chaos) manifests in decisive micro-choices, especially uncorking the whisper despite knowing the cost. The final realization that she “opened the door to a more authentic, though chaotic, existence” is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional weight. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her poetic reimagining of Veridia stems from personal loss and failed revolution—but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; sorrow dominates without competing impulses in-scene. Her micro-choices (covering mirrors, placing the shard) reveal values, yet emotional embodiment leans on lyrical abstraction (“burnished sorrow”) over visceral sensation. The final renunciation of political revolution for poetic legacy feels earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than materially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal stakes intensify credibly under pressure. However, his emotional progression lacks embodied contradiction—his truthfulness feels absolute rather than hard-won, flattening the moral tension the covenant of rust should provoke. The townsman’s lie creates external friction but doesn’t force Elian into a genuine internal dilemma; his response is immediate and untroubled. This undermines the “flaws complicate choices” benchmark for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—collecting petrichor to grasp the ineffable—is deeply rooted in her eccentric yet coherent identity. Her internal conflict (reason vs. wonder) manifests physically through micro-choices: carrying the compass, refusing to open vials, leaving it behind. The psychometric visions feel earned, not diagnostic, and her final renunciation carries tangible cost—abandoning her life’s method for a deeper truth. No safety-hedging; her flaw (trying to bottle transience) directly enables her awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in her identity as a “perpetually learning” artist, and her internal conflict—between solitary creation and ancestral dialogue—is embodied through tactile choices (e.g., selecting driftwood, following projections). Her epiphany feels earned, not diagnostic, though the ghosts’ guidance borders on convenient. The final renunciation of GPS for inner coordinates shows credible endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in personal history, yet her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her “quiet drive” manifests as steady resolve without meaningful struggle or flawed missteps. The epiphany feels earned through discovery but leans on inherited wisdom rather than hard-won error. Her tremor upon connecting postcards shows emotion, but the absence of resistance or doubt flattens agency. Still, her micro-choices (visiting cathedral, painting mural) align credibly with her trait-driven quest.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her solemn duty, embodied tension (“heart pounding”), and micro-choices (arranging debris) reveal a hierarchy of values. The vision forces her to confront moral complexity, not just recover facts. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The final resolve feels earned but borders on tidy renunciation rather than messy endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—rejecting magical dependency in favor of reason—but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. He moves smoothly from reflection to action without visible struggle, making his transformation feel slightly too rational. The amber bottle functions well as a symbolic anchor, yet his emotional arc leans on assertion (“rejected the false comfort”) rather than dramatized tension. His final stance is credible but not deeply contested within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in a childhood memory that recurs with emotional specificity, and his internal conflict—between archival duty and prophetic dread—is embodied through trembling hands and the “velvet disquiet.” His micro-choices (shaving the cylinder, recalling the field trip) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort. However, his emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; fear and duty alternate rather than collide in-scene, slightly flattening interior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the texture of borrowed time—is vividly embodied in her actions and micro-choices, especially her use of seeds and the acorn cap. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory and tactile specificity (“smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone”). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves with near-perfect competence under pressure, reducing internal friction. The final renunciation isn’t dramatized—only acceptance—limiting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “credibly curious” nature, and her final choice to ring the bell over activating the siren feels earned. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped—her hesitation is stated but not dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses. Emotions are embodied (“hand hovered,” “quiet satisfaction”) but lack visceral tension during the zero hour. The cost of her innovation (potential failure, isolation) is implied but not viscerally felt in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is consistent and emotionally embodied, especially in his empathy with dying stars and his relationship to the yellow lantern glass. However, his transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—his vulnerability reads as a steady state rather than a tension. The final realization feels earned but leans on summary (“he had learned…”) rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. His spiritual curiosity drives reflection but not decisive action that forecloses alternatives with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recluse’s motivation—to preserve unspoken words—is consistent and rooted in his tranquilly perceptive nature, driving his passive yet decisive act of opening the box. His interiority is concrete (“heart pounding,” “gaze steady”), avoiding diagnostic labels, and his endurance constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost: lifelong solitude to uphold silence. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he observes, understands, and acts without hesitation or struggle, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of genuine flaw or misbelief limits depth despite strong embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her desire to feel time’s texture, and her micro-choices—embedding cryptic messages, focusing on the urn fragment—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves from solitude to partnership without friction or resistance that tests her core belief. Leo appears fully aligned with her quest, reducing relational pressure. The epiphany about time as melody feels earned but leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak (“time’s texture was not in its measure, but in its experience”).

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation—to find beauty in the incomplete—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., not fixing the kite, using the feather as talisman). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; his calm wisdom lacks struggle or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The child functions more as a thematic mirror than a crucible, limiting relational pressure. His “warmly attentive” trait is shown but never costs him anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation crystallizes with credible urgency, and her “brazen calm” is embodied through precise micro-choices—winding copper wire, whispering to stone—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action (e.g., systematic method paired with spiritual appeals). The final renunciation of life for legacy feels earned, though the lack of tangible struggle slightly softens the cost. Flaws are present but not safety-hedged; her competence is balanced by physical decline that visibly constrains later actions.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through her luminescence and skepticism, with micro-choices (carrying the amber, following footprints) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her academically rebellious nature drives credible action, not just label. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy—her doubt resolves cleanly without lingering contradiction at the climax, softening the cost of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poetic desire to heal historical trauma through horticulture. However, his interiority remains abstract—emotions are named (“satisfied,” “solitary”) rather than embodied, and no contradictory impulses surface under pressure. His actions align with motive, but the lack of internal friction or tangible cost beyond atmospheric melancholy limits depth. The character functions more as an allegorical vessel than a psychologically textured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Baron’s motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, tactile handling of leaf/cylinder) and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. His intuitively descriptive perception drives the climax credibly. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped—his yearning lacks simultaneous competing impulses, trending toward singular focus rather than layered conflict. The final choice feels earned but leans slightly on poetic inevitability over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in ancestral tradition and personal isolation. His internal conflict—between duty as “blessed pariah” and the pull toward exploration—is embodied through tactile details (the compass rose, sketching) rather than abstract introspection. The final decision feels earned by prior micro-choices: saving the sketch, recalibrating sensors, turning from the window. However, his emotional state remains slightly too coherent under extreme stress—minimal degradation of perception or irrationality limits full psychological verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is vividly rooted in his identity as an “apprentice of wonder,” and his chivalrous thief ethos drives concrete choices—bowing to the guardian, swapping pieces with reverence. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action: playful yet purposeful, reverent yet daring. However, the guardian remains a cipher, limiting relational depth. The final descent shows credible endurance without overstatement, but the lack of tangible personal cost slightly undercuts full character resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trauma, guilt, and purpose manifest through tactile gestures (running a finger along the chessboard) and micro-choices (spelling “forgive” for herself). Her benevolently ruthless nature drives action with visible cost: discarding grand narratives to preserve fragile truths. However, her transformation leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“survivor’s guilt”) rather than raw contradiction under pressure, softening the edge of emotional realism in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding “the shape of home”—is embodied through tactile rituals (feather, mercury-glass) and evolves credibly from avoidance to acceptance. Her buried talents aren’t just stated but shown as both wound and instrument, with micro-choices (pressing feather to stone, seeding visions) revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; grief manifests as sensory substitution, not diagnosis. The final renunciation of escapist visions carries felt cost: clarity that “hurt but healed.”

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his fidgeting, his tactile engagement with the tapestry and labyrinth—and his motivation (self-forgiveness) intensifies credibly under pressure. His flaws (arrogance, negligence) directly caused his exile, and his final renunciation of pride feels earned. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from guilt to acceptance lacks a moment of irrational resistance or hypocrisy that would deepen realism. The micro-choice to pluck the thread is well-anchored and catalytic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a defiant, mischievous artist who believes truth must be refracted. Her internal contradiction—challenging ritual purity with multiplicity—is embodied in her poetic acts and micro-choices. Emotions are shown through action (smiling at unraveling, moving among listeners) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of singular forgiveness is earned by her consistent stance and carries the conceptual cost of lifelong acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rendered through tactile detail (the key charm, acid sting) and embodied urgency, but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—his dread and wonder alternate rather than collide. The final endurance feels earned, yet the absence of a tangible flaw or misstep undercuts the “uncertain” descriptor. His choices align with motive, but emotional complexity remains streamlined for thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her nostalgia, aloofness, and grief are rendered through tactile details (faded blue paint, trembling fingers) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation—a hidden promise to reclaim “perfect peace”—drives credible micro-choices: packing the unpainted shell, taking the wrong turn, placing the found shell back. The final renunciation feels earned because her flaw (clinging to memory as a cage) directly shapes her arc. However, the emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, costing a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in lived experience—waves erasing footprints, childhood garden memories—and her actions align with a quiet, persistent love. Her interiority avoids diagnostic phrasing, instead embodying emotion through tactile focus (the cool vial, the humming cork). The final choice—to whisper rather than shout—is earned by consistent character logic. However, the brother’s off-page presence limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and consistent, rooted in navigating “the geography of loss,” and her patchwork identity informs both skill and emotional texture. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels—grief is embodied through tactile actions (handling the censer foot, etching circles) and micro-choices under pressure. The final realization that the voice was her own feels earned, not epiphanic, because it emerges from accumulated physical labor and lunar attunement. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told she confronts rather than flees, but don’t witness simultaneous opposing impulses clashing mid-action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—psychological safety amid involuntary truthfulness—is consistent and embodied through her actions (e.g., smuggling the eye, performing the ritual). Her internal conflict between rationality and vulnerability manifests in micro-choices like calculating lightning risk versus mental relief. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from isolation to “hard-won tranquility” lacks friction or regression under stress. The final renunciation of compulsion feels earned but borders on diagnostic clarity (“static silence,” “fragile wall”) rather than messy, lived-in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in loneliness, with micro-choices like pocketing the Edelweiss and writing the letter revealing his values. His interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays embodied (“damp air,” “trace the faded ink”). However, the borrowed memories verge on unearned epiphany—Elias accesses vivid alpine recollections without sufficient causal scaffolding. The final renunciation of mystery for peace feels earned, though the transition leans slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s empirically intuitive nature and grief-driven motivation are consistent and embodied, especially in his tactile engagement with the chip and ants. His final renunciation feels earned, not tidy—his solitude is transformed through choice, not erased. However, interior contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told he’s torn but don’t witness simultaneous opposing impulses during the climactic moment. The emotional cost is felt, yet the decision lacks micro-hesitation that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“weight of her crown feeling like a cage”) and consistent motivation, but her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure—her climb feels inevitable rather than contested. The guardian encounter offers momentary peace but doesn’t force a character-defining decision. Her final resolve emerges more from revelation than struggle, softening the cost of her disenchantment’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “scientifically romantic” identity, and her internal shift—from observer to participant—is credibly earned through Kael’s revelation. However, her emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“density of presence,” “revalue herself”) rather than embodied contradiction. Kael functions more as a truth-deliverer than a pressured counterpart; their relationship lacks reciprocal tension. The final transformation feels resonant but marginally tidy given the story’s lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—jealousy, nostalgia, and exhaustion manifest through tactile sensations (charred stick, dream-dirt) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to chronicle而非 flee the vision reveals a hierarchy of values: meaning-making over comfort. The flaw—chronological confusion—is not just stated but enacted in the non-linear scroll, foreclosing escape into linear denial. Only slight over-articulation in “feral nostalgia” edges toward label-speak, but it’s redeemed by immediate dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in sensory loss and a yearning for meaning. Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak and shows embodied contradiction—e.g., seeking healing while doubting her capacity. The repairman functions effectively as a catalyst rather than a full character, preserving focus. However, her final shift leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the emotional cost of losing smell isn’t viscerally dramatized enough to fully ground her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in transforming scars into stories, and her internal conflict—rigidity vs. flow—is embodied through crystallizing ink and trembling hands. However, emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution; contradictions (e.g., embracing superstition while being a scholar) aren’t fully dramatized as simultaneous impulses. The final renunciation of doubt feels earned but lacks a micro-choice with visible cost beyond metaphorical shedding.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are concrete and consistent—her belief in “imperfect miracles” shapes her actions and emotional stakes. Her micro-choices (uncorking the perfume, activating the device) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: facilitating closure despite knowing it won’t be perfect. The ghosts’ limited agency aligns with the story’s metaphysical rules, avoiding over-articulated self-awareness. However, Alistair’s sorrow feels slightly generic compared to Elara’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“unravel cosmic illusions,” “spiral arbitration”) rather than embodied emotion or specific struggle. The character functions more as a philosophical cipher than an individual with flaws, blind spots, or evolving tactics. Final renunciation lacks visible cost because no prior stakes were concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shepherd’s interiority is concrete and consistent, driven by a precise epistemological obsession rather than vague yearning. His micro-choices—counting backwards, inserting the key twice, ceasing to squint—are tightly aligned with his evolving understanding of time as resistance. However, the final insight arrives with near-diagnostic clarity (“clocks measure the human desire to carve permanence from flux”) that borders on articulation beyond what the immediate sensory experience justifies, slightly undermining embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is compellingly embodied through her spatial gift and professional role, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves smoothly from detection to revelation without meaningful resistance or struggle. Her emotional arc feels earned yet leans toward diagnostic clarity (“letting go was not a loss, but a transformation”) rather than messy, embodied contradiction. The final renunciation of control is credible but lacks visible cost beyond abstract insight. A stronger friction between her security instincts and openness would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete emotional textures (“clover melancholy,” “fragile illumination”), and her motivation—balancing rebellion with responsibility—is consistent and compelling. However, her epiphany about “lucid contradictions” arrives through reflection rather than a pressured choice, weakening the causal link to her final stance. The journal discovery feels convenient, not earned through struggle. Her flaws are stated more than dramatized in action under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in personal history and expressed through micro-choices (e.g., initiating the loop). His estrangement functions as a crucible rather than coldness, and his internal contradiction—serving others while remaining detached—is embodied without therapy-speak. Elara’s grief feels raw but not overwritten; her shift is earned through the loop’s reframing. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her role as archivist, with interiority conveyed through embodied ritual (steeping the locket, writing with walnut ink). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves from sorrow to “bittersweet triumph” without internal resistance or doubt. The final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, weakening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “desperately jocular” contradiction is embodied in her dialogue with pigeons and brittle smile, revealing a hierarchy of values—connection over comfort—with visible cost (her ongoing loneliness). Leo’s skepticism-to-shift feels earned through micro-choices (sitting, accepting the rock). Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise via concrete perception (“ivory silence,” “warm fragment”). However, Elara’s astronaut backstory risks slight over-articulation but is anchored by the moon rock’s physical presence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, perception, and motivation are rendered through tactile and sonic metaphors that feel native to her blindness. Her micro-choices (adjusting path by ring-pulse, kneeling to dowse) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, attunement over control. The emotional arc avoids therapy-speak; sorrow transforms via resonance, not resolution. Final acceptance feels earned through sensory immersion, not intellectual insight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s “confident uncertainty” is embodied in micro-choices—revising logs, sending queries, composing signals—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her flaw (the “wrong seeds”) compounds credibly and drives every action without safety-hedging. The dried pen isn’t just symbolic; it’s a tactile anchor for her moral calibration. Final signal composition earns its weight through prior causality and carries the cost of irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied—his “joyful sorrow,” trembling hands, and tactile relationship with the camera reveal layered emotion without diagnostic labels. The advisor, while enigmatic, functions effectively as a catalyst rather than a fully dimensional character, which fits the lyric mode. Motivation stems credibly from shared silence and obscurity, culminating in Elian’s earned shift from passive isolation to active perception. The final choice—to carry the music forward—is rooted in prior causality and carries palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his “volcanic tenderness,” past arsonist guilt, and present reverence for preservation feel cohesive and pressurized. His transformation from destroyer to mender is earned via micro-choices (studying slash marks, mending tapestry) that align with his analytically intuitive trait. The vandalized self-portrait triggers genuine introspection, not epiphany, and his final stance forecloses his former identity with palpable cost. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy in the closing reflection, softening the moral ambiguity expected of a former arsonist.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her drumming as resistance and meaning-making—but her interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Emotions are rendered through poetic filters (“auroral sorrow”) rather than visceral, conflicting impulses in scene. The transformation from subject to guardian feels earned thematically but lacks micro-choices that concretely narrow options under pressure. Her agency is expressive, not tactical, which suits the Accumulative lens but limits psychological granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied through her actions and micro-choices—her walk-reading skill, use of the zodiac coin, and quiet leadership all reveal a consistent, nuanced interiority. Kael’s transformation feels earned through subtle shifts in posture and tone rather than exposition. However, Elara’s internal contradiction remains underexplored; her “calculated spontaneity” reads more as stylistic flourish than psychological tension. The final renunciation of volume as strength lacks a visible personal cost, weakening emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in empathetic guardianship, and her actions align with her silent, precise nature. However, her internal conflict remains underdeveloped—her calm is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The child’s spirit functions more as a symbolic presence than a relational pressure, limiting emotional stakes. Her micro-choices are elegant but lack visible cost beyond atmospheric tension.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—planting “forests of second thoughts”—and her actions align with this quiet rebellion. Her interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into abstract phrasing (“unspoken words… echoing like faint whispers”) that risks emotional vagueness. The lodestone king cradling reveals character through ritualized care, yet internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses during pressure. Final renunciation of violence is earned, though the cost feels conceptual more than visceral.

    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “guarded heart,” the “combative tenderness,” and the physicality of her grace all reveal a coherent, conflicted self. Her motivation (freedom via true nature) intensifies believably under pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses her dock life with felt cost. The whalebone scrimshaw functions as both talisman and catalyst, grounding her choice in prior causality. However, the transition from tension to surrender lacks a micro-struggle; the final step feels slightly too seamless for full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—performing mandated joy while privately carving grief—is vividly embodied through tactile detail (numb fingers, brittle bouquet) and morally weighted micro-choices (reporting neighbors). Her motivation is consistent and rooted in loss, though the final renunciation lacks a decisive on-page cost that forecloses a concrete path. The emotional void is compelling but risks abstraction; “cultivating lightness” remains more conceptual than dramatized through irreversible action. Still, her blank face as shield and narrator-as-performer create a coherent, specific psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in aesthetic rebellion, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his certainty never truly wavers, undercutting emotional complexity. His choices align with motive, yet the absence of struggle or misstep makes his transformation feel frictionless rather than earned. The “tremor of certainty” reads more as rhetorical flourish than genuine doubt. Final renunciation or endurance is absent; instead, he achieves total success without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his colorblindness and desire to find beauty in imperfection. His “innocently cunning” trait manifests credibly in his choice of barter (the broken concertina), revealing layered values. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, showing emotion through embodied perception—e.g., interpreting plant language as queries. However, Maestra remains more symbolic than fully dimensional; her silence limits reciprocal pressure, slightly flattening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“calloused fingers,” “powerfully gentle touch”) and consistent motivation rooted in her quest for connection. Her pivotal choice—to reconfigure the lens as a bridge rather than a focus—emerges organically from introspection under pressure, foreclosing isolation with felt cost. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the frustration-to-revelation shift is smooth but lacks visceral struggle. The final renunciation of sterile preservation feels earned, yet the absence of a tangible sacrifice (beyond time) softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile details—hands too heavy to lift a hammer, steady again only after transformation—and her motivation evolves credibly from paralysis to purpose. Her micro-choices (following coordinates, reopening the sealed room) reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring loss while seeking renewal. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves cleanly from despair to determination without lingering ambivalence in-scene. The final act feels earned but slightly streamlined, missing the messy friction of real emotional reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “steadily curious” nature, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her fear and drive coexist without tangible friction. Her micro-choices (using the tape, laying cards) reveal values, yet no decision carries visible cost that forecloses a path. Leo functions as a passive listener, not a crucible; their dynamic applies minimal pressure. The final insight feels earned by pattern recognition, not struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to heal through forbidden knowledge. Her internal conflict—anguished joy—is embodied in physical reactions (tears, smile) and erratic ritual movements. However, her emotional state remains largely summarized rather than dramatized in real-time contradiction; the epiphany about innocence feels slightly diagnostic (“end of innocence” named outright). Micro-choices (erratic steps, non-repeating chants) reveal values but lack visceral struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied through her actions with the river stone and dream footage. Her internal conflict—preserving hope versus honoring painful truth—is rendered with specificity, not abstraction. The final choice carries visible cost: “some transformations come with the cost of forgetting.” However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the transformation feels more inevitable than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her conflict between self-respect and compassion manifests through concrete micro-choices (e.g., cleaning the chameleon’s wound instead of reattaching the tail). Her emotional state avoids diagnostic labels, using tactile imagery (“feather-light” touch) and layered contradictions (“scalding need… deep, ingrained pull”). The final stance feels earned: she sheds bitterness without denying betrayal. Flawed yet resilient, she reads as a specific individual, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scar-picking, coffee-ring scrutiny, and plant-whispering all reveal a psyche fractured yet driven. His contradictory impulses (seeking closure while reopening wounds) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final acceptance feels earned through tactile choices (digging with roots, touching the crystal), not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; pain and perception remain character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her spatial imagination and obsession with unused love drive every action. Interiority is richly embodied (“cool cellulose felt like skin,” “images flickered behind her eyes”) without therapy-speak. Her final renunciation—acting as conduit, not beneficiary—carries quiet cost. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in-scene (only reflection) prevents full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rendered, and her internal conflict—between cosmic longing and creative paralysis—is consistent. However, her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; the epiphany arrives as a realization rather than a decision forged in struggle. Emotions are lyrical but sometimes abstract (“shadowed rapture”) without embodied contradiction. The final stance feels earned thematically but not causally through on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s dreamless state is consistently embodied and drives her unique suitability for the task, with micro-choices like tending multiple sparks revealing her hierarchy of values. Her transformation—from hollow vessel to one who “welcomed dreams”—is earned through sustained effort and visible cost (increasing hollowness). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; she lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses, operating more as a stoic conduit than a psychologically layered agent. The absence of secondary characters limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied—her quest for cognitive frontier mirrors the forest’s mechanics—but internal contradiction remains underexplored. Her micro-choices (e.g., using the gear, interpreting wind) reveal values, yet emotional stakes feel intellectualized rather than viscerally conflicted. The epiphany at climax reads earned through tactile engagement, not diagnostic self-awareness. However, her passivity during translocations slightly undercuts agency, limiting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fear, freedom, and uncoiling resolve feel specific and earned. The guides function more as archetypes than individuals, but their limited presence doesn’t undermine the single-POV focus. Her motivation (“to find where unused courage waits”) avoids therapy-speak and manifests through micro-choices: offering her hand, continuing to walk. The final renunciation of the leash—and embrace of a chosen tether—is credible and charged with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in his vow of silence and nerve regeneration. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied sensation (“nerves tingled with new growth”) and concrete micro-choices (pocketing the bolt, returning to the archives). The contradiction between duty and truth-seeking drives his arc without artificial balance. Final renunciation—choosing to remain while rejecting the silence—is earned through prior causality and carries visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lorian’s motivation is singular and consistent, rooted in loyalty and truth, driving every action with quiet intensity. His interiority is embodied through tactile rituals (ink, brush, runes) rather than abstract musing. The confrontation with Theron crystallizes his endurance as agency—“I am a titan in purpose”—a credible renunciation of force in favor of revelation. However, the absence of internal contradiction or struggle slightly flattens emotional complexity; his flawlessness borders on archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation—rooted in witnessing coral bleaching—is consistent and embodied through tactile habits like rhythmic tapping. Their internal conflict between grief and hope manifests in micro-choices (e.g., unfolding the atlas, correlating data) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle; the “delayed revelation” feels more intellectual than wrestled from doubt. The character reads as individualized, but emotional progression leans slightly tidy for the depth claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her bare feet, the opera glasses, her “awkward confidence”—all revealing a character rooted in sensory specificity. Her motivation (“to discover meaning in the mess”) is consistent and intensifies credibly toward purpose. However, the transition from passive observer to catalytic force lacks micro-choices that dramatize struggle; the stone circle’s power acts *on* her more than she wrestles with it. The epiphany feels earned emotionally but not causally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to evolve tradition with intent—is compellingly rooted in her identity as an insurgent grandmother and telepathic listener to plants. Her interiority is concrete (“the ferns near the springs trembled with unusual urgency”), and her micro-choices (decoding the script, sharing visions) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in scene; she moves cleanly from discovery to leadership without inner friction that tests her resolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her freeze response, breath catching, and tactile rituals feel authentic and specific. Her motivation (“anchor optimism in realism”) is dramatized through grafting and tending, not merely stated. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“somatic markers,” “pearl of stillness”) that borders on therapy-speak during peak stress, risking over-articulation. Still, her micro-choices (smoothing the photo, walking to the cliff) reveal a credible hierarchy of values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his shame, doubt, and artistic crisis manifest through tactile details (dust, charcoal, splintered box) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (untangling memory threads, gathering cards, picking up charcoal) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over flattery, brokenness over illusion. The final renunciation of surface portraiture for soul-cartography feels earned by his prior failures. However, the transition from paralysis to action leans slightly on epiphany rather than granular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s “serene anger” and consciously wild nature manifest in embodied choices—his precise ritual with the ink, his controlled focus during temporal dilation—not as labels but as lived contradiction. His motivation (to understand time’s subjective slowing) drives every action, and his final resolution feels earned through disciplined pursuit. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; instead, emotion is filtered through perception (“cold, steady flame beneath his calm exterior”). However, the absence of interpersonal pressure limits relational depth, capping full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict is stated more than dramatized; “bravely conflicted” reads as label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation is clear but lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final resolve feels earned thematically but not causally—her fear vanishes too cleanly. Still, her emotional arc aligns with the stakes, and the cost of potential disappearance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pacifist stance and rejection of her father’s violence are clearly motivated, and her “senselessly perceptive” trait informs her actions. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped—her choice feels resolute without meaningful struggle or trade-off under pressure. The final renunciation lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path; she simply succeeds. Her emotional embodiment remains lyrical but abstract, leaning on phrases like “tranquil blaze” without grounding in physical sensation or flawed response.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s cool-headedness is embodied through precise micro-choices—zigzagging, voicing silence, suppressing fear—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly, though internal contradiction remains subtle rather than simultaneous. The rail spike externalizes emotion without therapy-speak, grounding his resolve in tactile action. Final renunciation isn’t needed; his endurance earns stasis with visible cost in the garden’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her devotion to observation clashes with her desire for emotional distance, embodied in her trembling hands and clenched pen nib. Her motivation intensifies credibly from personal doubt to moral resolve, culminating in a decisive act that forecloses complicity. The final choice feels earned by prior causality: each file she reads tightens the orbit of regret until intervention becomes inevitable. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains tactile and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guilt is embodied through visceral reactions to sound and memory, not abstract remorse. Her translation ability functions as both wound and tool, grounding her flaw in a specific, consistent trait. The final act—inscribing silence into acoustic fields—is a credible renunciation that forecloses escape into abstraction, carrying visible emotional cost. However, the younger self appears only as a glimpse, slightly weakening the immediacy of the internal contradiction at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s whimsy and social perception are embodied through precise actions—sifting sand, ignoring provocation—and her motivation (“discover meaning in the mess”) drives every choice. Her internal conflict (art as response to communal despair) manifests physically and emotionally without therapy-speak. The woman’s outburst tests her resolve, and her silent continuation reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: enduring scorn to offer fragile hope. Minor deduction: secondary characters remain lightly sketched, though choreography stays clear.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara/Aeliana’s interiority is vividly embodied—her steel gauntlets, retrocognitive traps, and tactile tracing of mosaic patterns reveal a psyche under pressure. Her contradiction (empathy armored in steel) drives every micro-choice, culminating in the earned act of renaming. The transformation feels inevitable yet costly, with no diagnostic label-speak marring her epiphany. Her flaws (being trapped in memory) directly shape her arc without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—encore-seeking as existential longing—is vividly embodied through synesthetic perception and micro-choices (e.g., clutching the tarot coin, singing to weave echoes). Her internal contradiction (despair vs. hope) pulses in every action, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—bowing not for applause but fulfillment—is earned by her persistent agency. However, the absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alex’s affectionate skepticism is embodied consistently, especially in his warm dismissal of the geode’s mystical properties and his tactile memory work. His motivation—to reach Mara through shared somatic echoes—is credible and intensifies under time pressure. However, his internal contradiction (skepticism vs. hope) resolves too cleanly; the shift from doubt to “determined action” lacks friction or a misstep that would ground his transformation. The final choice feels earned but slightly idealized, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is consistent and interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception, but emotional progression leans toward tidy synthesis rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The floating fossil triggers epiphany without prior struggle or misstep, making the climactic realization feel earned more by concept than character causality. Embodied emotion is strong early (“walls that pulse with forgotten energies”) but flattens into diagnostic phrasing near the end (“tapestry of transition”). Final renunciation or endurance lacks visible cost—Kaelen gains voice without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hourglass turner’s motivation is consistent and rooted in generational duty versus personal rebellion, with embodied emotion (“hands steady despite the weight”) and micro-choices (selecting specific buttons) revealing her hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory and symbolic perception. However, internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses—her resolve never visibly wavers, flattening emotional complexity at key pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “prudently daring” nature manifests in embodied choices (e.g., cautious descent, opening the pillbox) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Anya’s arc from fear to courage feels earned through micro-behaviors (ushering him in, standing guard). However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the transition from betrayal to redemptive sacrifice lacks friction between competing impulses in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory memory and symbolic objects, but his motivation leans on abstract phrasing like “distill complexity into essence” without sufficient contradiction in action. His final insight—self-forgiveness—is earned emotionally but lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path. The yarn needle functions more as metaphor than catalyst for embodied struggle. Still, his attentiveness and regret feel consistent, if slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his potter’s grace, Zen calm, and phototropism to kindness shape perception and action. His micro-choices (tracing hive wood, meditating with the glass) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final act—holding the lantern aloft—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he becomes participant, not observer. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile and visual cues.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” nature is embodied through precise micro-choices—handling the bitting gauge, rowing with ritualistic care, using the mirror—that reveal her internal contradiction between acceptance and hope. Her motivation feels rooted, not declared, and the final bud sighting earns its quiet payoff. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the grief of loss dissipates a touch too smoothly into peace without lingering friction. No diagnostic label-speak mars interiority, and the inherited tool anchors her worldview credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—translating isolation into independence—is compelling and consistently embodied through her tactile engagement with the sundial and stone circle. Her internal conflict between past and present selves is rendered with specificity, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice to embrace legacy over loss feels earned, with visible cost in her relinquished hope for personal continuity. However, the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-resistance mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent—her whimsy, emotional distance, and yearning for connection shape her actions believably. The final renunciation of ghostwriting anonymity feels earned through tactile engagement with the spiral and community. However, her internal contradiction (“keeper of secrets” vs. desire for vulnerability) resolves with slight tidiness; the epiphany leans toward diagnostic clarity (“the thread… was the act of vulnerability itself”) without sufficient friction or ambiguity in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motivation—to outwit cosmic tricksters—is consistent and drives his high-stakes decision to broadcast illegally. His interiority is concrete (“weary eyes,” “frantic circles” on charts), and his calm declaration to Evans reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over compliance. The cost—career risk, potential blame—is visible, and his cautious hope evolves credibly into resilient resolve. However, internal contradiction remains slightly muted; the story leans more on external pressure than simultaneous conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature are clearly established, but her internal conflict often reads as summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Her transformation feels earned thematically, yet key emotional shifts rely on declarative reflection (“she had faced the tightest spaces and emerged stronger”) rather than embodied choices under pressure. The keeper’s sudden appearance lacks relational tension or status dynamics that could deepen her arc. Still, her micro-choices—using the compass amid panic—show consistent motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face blindness is not a gimmick but a perceptual filter that shapes her method and moral stance. Her motivation—awakening dormant empathy—is credibly rooted in her artistic compulsion, and her micro-choices (pacing the quarry, closing her eyes to “feel” space) reveal a hierarchy of values. The internal contradiction between emotional detachment and profound empathic drive operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. However, the final realization arrives with slight diagnostic clarity (“not malicious… but accident”) that borders on over-articulation without fully embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply personal and consistently drives her actions, from unpacking gear to coordinating the probe dive. Her “nervously confident” trait manifests in embodied contradiction—steady hands but a trembling voice—and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses doubt with emotional cost. The ancestral backstory is anchored in present cues (the journal, the nail) and tilts her stance via micro-choices, satisfying BRR. However, Roy remains underdeveloped as a pressure source, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his dynamic observation shapes perception and action, especially in how he interprets the scaffold flutters and glass flake. His motivation (“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) is consistent and emotionally grounded, though his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction. The final choice to play a bridge-song feels earned but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path beyond abstract emotional shifts. His flaw (over-interpretation) isn’t tested under pressure that forces a costly error.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s interiority is concrete and layered, with contradictory impulses—yearning for escape yet drawn to ancestral ruin—embodied through tactile interaction with the train and currency. His micro-choices (interpreting markers, dissuading the squatter) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by inherited trauma. However, the epiphany about “carrying the past within us” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting emotional authenticity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and emotionally grounded in her mentor’s legacy, and her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses—her doubt and fatigue dissolve too cleanly upon epiphany, undercutting the “genuine struggle” expected at this tier. The final warmth feels earned but slightly tidy for a story aspiring to elite literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s guardedness and emotional restraint are vividly embodied (“emotions locked away like seeds in winter”) and her motivation—to unbend generational silence—is compelling and consistent. Her micro-choices (kneeling, chanting, pressing the seed to the ice) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see resolve, not struggle. The final unbending feels earned but leans slightly toward epiphany over layered transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “purposefully curious” nature and deep bond with the glade, driving every action. Her internal conflict—between duty as a root-bound guardian and the yearning for freedom—is embodied through physical sensation (aching roots, blood from thorns) rather than abstract introspection. The final choice to cross the portal feels earned by prior causality: her scars, the clipping, and covenant history all converge. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy—tears and laughter resolve complex tension without lingering contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s reckless idealism and internal contradiction—fiercely gentle yet desperate to control meaning—are embodied in tactile choices (smoothing the card, kneeling among bones). Her micro-decisions reveal a hierarchy of values: control over surrender, symbol over truth. The keeper’s challenge forces a credible shift from dominance to acceptance, with visible cost in relinquishing her bartered fate. However, her emotional calibration leans slightly tidy; the transition from “dusky resolve” to peace lacks irrational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leo’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied details (e.g., clutching the grille cloth, deflecting with technical facts), and his “confidently uncertain” state drives micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. However, his epiphany about combining past/present feels slightly rushed—motivated but not fully pressured by on-page struggle. Mara’s empathy breaches his walls efficiently, yet Leo’s shift leans on assertion (“I think I know what to do”) more than dramatized recalibration under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—understanding the physics of transition—is rooted in his professional identity and personal longing, intensified by past failures. His kindly methodical nature is not just stated but enacted through pacing, tracing glyphs, and analogical reasoning. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“heart ached,” “fingers tracing”) and contradictory (haunted yet patient). The final renunciation of haunted ambition for wisdom feels earned through consistent micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to preserve wonder through embracing contradiction—is consistent and embodied in tactile actions (handling the creel, whispering to identities). His internal conflict (guardian of paradoxes in a grinding system) manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous acceptance of dualities. However, his emotional range remains serene throughout, lacking degradation under stress or irrational contradiction that would deepen realism. The fisherman’s memory functions more as thematic echo than a catalyst for micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his hesitation, tears, and shift from fear-focused inspection to hope-centered advocacy feel earned. His motivation intensifies credibly through tactile engagement with the shell and pearl. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany arises from sensory immersion, not abstraction. However, his pre-cave emotional state lacks contradiction—his “walls” are asserted rather than dramatized under prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, precision, and grief manifest through tactile interactions with the accordion, map, and graffiti. Her “daringly methodical” approach isn’t just stated but enacted in how she scans the bathroom wall and redraws emotional landmarks. The final choice to play the accordion feels earned by prior causality: her grandfather’s wisdom, the Blackwater Bend failure, and the medication cessation all converge. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“forgiveness was not about absolving fault…”) rather than fully contradictory, messy emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in the fateful letters and her quest for truth, but her interiority leans on repeated emotional labels (“cautious exuberance”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her choices—documenting, recalibrating, trusting notes—are credible and aligned with her goal, yet lack deep internal conflict or visible trade-offs beyond persistence. The confidence man’s watch evolves from deceptive tool to honest guide, reflecting her moral clarity, but her flaws remain underexplored. Final renunciation isn’t dramatized; success arrives through endurance, not transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—sweat-slick fingers, mulberry ache, telepathic plant murmurs—and her contradictory impulses (dream vs. duty) act simultaneously in the climax. Her micro-choice to play the violin over fulfilling imperial demand is earned through escalating pressure and consistent with her perforated-destiny worldview. However, the “perforated destiny” concept borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of how it concretely alters prior tactics. The final renunciation feels resonant but leans slightly on lyrical assertion over causal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poignant desire to preserve beauty against oblivion. Her interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception rather than diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradiction or struggle—she executes her task flawlessly without internal friction or meaningful cost that alters her choices. The absence of a micro-choice with visible tradeoff undercuts the “lucidly watchful” trait’s potential for dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her forgiveness and search for contentment, and her “kindly decisive” trait informs her actions. However, internal conflict remains largely summarized rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses. Emotional states are embodied to a degree (e.g., tracing the hairpin), but peak realizations lean toward diagnostic phrasing (“contentment sprang from active participation in rebirth”) that borders on therapy-speak without sufficient counterbalancing irrationality or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s “sincerely insincere” contradiction is embodied through micro-choices—offering the mirror, draping the cloak—that reveal his moral mercenary ethos without self-deception. Elara’s shift from rigid certainty to adaptive nuance feels earned via tactile interaction with symbolic objects. Both characters avoid therapy-speak; emotions are conveyed through gesture (clutching jacket, trembling fingers) and environment (wind, chimes). The final cost—Elara’s relinquished binary thinking—is legible in her changed grip on the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s fear, dissolution, and renewal feel embodied and earned; Elara’s backwards aging is woven into her pedagogy rather than stated as gimmick. Both characters reveal hierarchy of values through micro-choices (Kael surrendering self, Elara withholding truth). However, Elara’s interiority remains slightly distant—her motivation is clear but not contradictory, leaning toward archetype. The final insight feels earned but borders on diagnostic in its clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to navigate without moving—is consistent and compelling, rooted in its historically reverent nature. Interiority is concrete (e.g., feeling the arrowhead’s weight as a “key”), and micro-choices (tracing contours, humming a tone) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; Elara’s resolve is unwavering, reducing emotional complexity. The final renunciation of motion feels earned but borders on epiphany without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a rejection of automation, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—his arc leans toward epiphany without meaningful struggle. The unstrapping of the spellbook and cloak are symbolic gestures rather than micro-choices under pressure with visible cost. His transformation feels earned thematically but not causally; the “underachiever” label is stated but never dramatized through failure or flawed action. Interiority remains poetic but abstract, avoiding the messy irrationality that would ground his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover the color of sound—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every key action from lamplighting to diving. His internal contradiction (seeking sensory truth in a world of silence) manifests through tactile choices: pocketing the key, diving without hesitation, inserting it with care. The transformation is earned: his vow to protect the knowledge feels like a natural extension of his obsession, not an imposed epiphany. However, the emotional shift at climax leans slightly toward unearned wonder rather than struggle, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire for cosmic harmony, yet her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her “quiet enthusiasm” never truly contends with doubt in action, only in passing thought. The epiphany about contraction-as-transformation feels earned through ritual repetition, but the emotional stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt. Her micro-choices (casting coins, listening to static) reveal dedication but not a hierarchy of values under pressure. The character reads as a vessel for theme more than a flawed individual with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reaper’s motivation—naming nameless fears tied to his lover’s sacrifice—is consistent and emotionally grounded. His interiority is embodied through tactile interaction with the atlas, prisms, and light, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The micro-choice to crystallize the echo via scattered light reveals a hierarchy of values: preserving memory over erasing pain. However, the emotional shift toward acceptance lacks a visible friction point where resistance yields; the transformation feels slightly too smooth for the depth of centuries-long grief.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly rendered—his brittle devotion, earnest naivety, and lukewarm power cohere into a distinct psychological profile. His micro-choices (wiping blood, timing the spell to dew drops) reveal values under pressure. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; doubt and faith alternate rather than collide. The resolution feels earned but leans slightly on trait-as-fate rather than complex internal negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his guilt, memory, and motivation arise from specific sensory triggers (the photograph, the liqueur label). His micro-choices (following the trail, speaking to villagers) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over silence, community over solitude. However, his transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the shift from private grief to communal storytelling lacks a visible internal struggle in-scene. The “precisely humane” trait is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior conflict between logic and intuition is embodied through concrete sensory details and micro-choices (e.g., hesitating to apply flame, closing her eyes to listen). Her “secretly sentimental” trait manifests in memory-driven behavior rather than labels, and the final act—warming, not melting, the crystal—reveals a hierarchy of values earned through struggle. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from doubt to wholeness lacks friction or backslide under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in duty, with embodied stress responses (e.g., tightening the buckle to steady nerves). However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her anxiety is noted but never truly wrestles with an opposing desire. The resolution feels earned, but her emotional arc leans toward tidy endurance rather than complex struggle. Her inventive trait informs action but doesn’t generate meaningful moral or tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s numbness and yearning for reconnection are embodied through precise interiority (“his numbness a fortress he desperately needed to breach”) and culminate in a credible emotional breakthrough. His “slicing through pretense” trait drives his final proposal, aligning action with motive. However, the clone’s sudden emotional flood into Kael leans slightly toward diagnostic convenience rather than fully dramatized reciprocity. The resolution earns its cost—breaking numbness—but skirts deeper contradiction in favor of synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her role as a guardian of creative space, but her interiority leans toward abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. Her decision-making feels rationalized rather than pressured, lacking the messy ambiguity expected at this tier. The “orthogonal approaches” framework reads more like a narrative device than a lived cognitive process under stress. Final choice is credible but not earned through on-page friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Conductor’s mournful eagerness and interior contradiction—grief versus urgency—are vividly embodied, especially in his “eyes holding centuries of unshed tears” and the tactile grip on the pull cord. His motivation is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (adjusting blowers, modulating lullabies). However, his emotional arc lacks a decisive renunciation or transformation; he fulfills duty but doesn’t confront a personal flaw or pay a unique cost beyond generic sorrow. The character feels mythic yet slightly archetypal, missing a final micro-choice that would cement 9+ status.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied longing and micro-choices—gripping the pendant, stepping into the between—but its transformation hinges on abstract acceptance rather than concrete action under pressure. The phrase “dimensionally homesick” borders on diagnostic label-speak, though it’s partially redeemed by physicalized yearning. Motivation (“to make friends with uncertainty”) remains consistent but leans conceptual; the final renunciation of the library feels earned yet lacks a tangible cost beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s stoic sensitivity and fear of destruction are embodied through physical hesitation and internal contradiction, especially when he “feared the total destruction needed.” His motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly toward defiance. However, the epiphany (“the penny dropped”) leans slightly into diagnostic phrasing (“fear was the very barrier”), bordering on label-speak without immediate embodied cost within two lines. The final choice is earned, but the emotional shift from despair to joy feels marginally compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied, with micro-choices (e.g., discarding amplification for attenuation) revealing her values under pressure. However, interior contradiction is minimal—her epiphany arrives smoothly without credible struggle or missteps. The shard of hush functions more as a magical solution than a crucible forcing flawed human reckoning. Emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy, leaning toward tidy insight rather than messy transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motivation is vividly rooted in his identity as a deckhand, and his resilient positivity drives tangible action rather than serving as mere label. His interiority is concrete—evident in tactile details like adjusting radio dials “with practiced hope”—and his emotional state remains embodied even amid temporal disorientation. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, his struggle manifests through micro-choices (e.g., holding the hourglass aloft) that reveal hierarchy of values. However, the absence of internal contradiction—his optimism never wavers under pressure—slightly flattens complexity expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the texture of connection—is compellingly embodied through her weaving and internal contradictions. Her calm amid chaos feels earned, not performative, and her micro-choices (e.g., continuing to weave during eruption) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the “profound sense of peace” arrives with minimal friction between memory distortion and identity. Interiority is rich but occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“realistically imaginary constructs”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her drive to reconnect with celestial navigation amid post-contact uncertainty grounds her actions. Her interiority is concrete (e.g., clutching the chain link, observing Kael’s disengagement), and her micro-choices—shifting pedagogy to include ancient mariners—reveal a hierarchy of values. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile detail and setting. However, the internal contradiction (“balancedly curious”) remains underexplored as active tension, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in generational duty and empathy. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through the hearing aid, the photograph, and tactile responses to cold and mist. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge via sensory detail and micro-choices (e.g., adjusting the device, holding up the photo). However, her “persistently curious nature” remains more stated than dramatized under pressure, slightly limiting contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and devotion to the unremembered are embodied consistently, driving micro-choices like pressing forward despite panic. Her internal contradiction—fear versus duty—is active in-scene, not summarized. The final peace feels earned through struggle, though her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without enough prior resistance to make the cost fully tactile. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her heartbeat-counting ritual embodies trauma while her reckoning with Kael’s ghost reveals layered guilt, ambition, and grief. Her micro-choices (handling the shard, focusing on ink) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The flaw of reckless confidence is consistent and causally tied to the catastrophe. Final renunciation of counting heartbeats feels earned through defragmentation, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate texture into sound before the Old Tongue dies—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with emotional and cultural urgency. Her copper-veined physiology and quiet articulacy aren’t decorative; they’re woven into her method and stakes. Internal conflict manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous desperation and discipline under pressure. The final choice—to harmonize with the curse rather than oppose it—feels earned by her observational patience and mimetic intelligence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation—to transmute communal bitterness into cosmic absurdity—is vividly embodied through his laughter amid confessions and use of the arrowhead. His interiority avoids therapy-speak, favoring action-driven contradiction (e.g., undercover researcher seeking transformation, not truth). Elara functions effectively as secondary pressure, her “frostbitten hope” sharpening Aris’s stakes without overcomplicating the frame. However, his final epiphany (“cosmic joke settled in his bones”) leans slightly declarative rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to reawaken beauty, and her internal conflict—between knowing her music holds power and not knowing how to wield it—is credibly rendered. Her micro-choices (clutching the locust shell, descending into the orchard, playing a heartbeat rhythm) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the despair-to-courage arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The resolution feels earned but borders on diagnostic self-awareness in lines like “true understanding had come not from knowledge alone.”

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his “respectfully rebellious” nature informs his actions, but interiority leans toward summary rather than embodied contradiction. Emotions are stated (“fear and determination”) without visceral grounding, and reflection occasionally flattens present pressure. His micro-choice to deploy the bottle feels aligned with motive but lacks visible cost or struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—interpreting silence as possibility—is consistent and embodied through tactile, quiet labor. His internal contradiction (silence vs. voice) culminates in the earned act of singing, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost: vulnerability after lifelong reticence. The grandfather’s melody emerges organically from memory, not exposition, and his micro-choices (polishing the fragment, restoring horses) align precisely with his quietly persistent nature. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “sanely eccentric” nature and intensifies credibly toward the climax. Her interiority blends scientific precision with poetic longing through concrete perception (“stained-glass atoms,” “hummed with silent sonnets”). The scarf’s dissolution carries emotional weight, though the absence of interpersonal pressure limits relational stakes. Her solitude evolves meaningfully but lacks contradictory impulses under true duress.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in unnameable loss—is embodied through precise, sensory-driven action (painting with light, adjusting exposure) rather than exposition. Her internal contradiction (longing vs. release) resolves in a renunciation that feels earned, not sentimental. The final recognition of her mother carries emotional weight without diagnostic self-awareness. Micro-choices (e.g., pouring her own longing into the palette) reveal hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the dream’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—freeing an idea from fear—but his interiority remains abstract, relying on lyrical labels (“improbable longing,” “unassumingly bold”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His actions align with his role, yet the emotional stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally lived. The lock of hair functions more as a symbol than a catalyst for internal conflict. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the single-POV execution lacks the granular specificity that would ground his quest in human urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s chronic curiosity is embodied in tactile, goal-driven actions—brushing mushrooms, aligning shards—not just stated. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions arise through sensory detail (e.g., “hands damp and trembling”). The recovered memory reveals a credible internal contradiction: love for her grandfather vs. the trauma of his failed bargain. Her final choice—to realign the constellation—is earned by prior causality and carries the felt cost of confronting loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s contradictory impulses—combative tenderness, walking backward while mentoring forward—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., retreating when nervous yet insisting Elian engage the shard). Elian’s shift from defiance to vulnerability feels earned through tactile interaction with tea leaves and glass. Both characters avoid diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through gesture (trembling hands, crossed arms) and constrained speech. The only flaw: the archivist’s backstory remains opaque, slightly limiting full interior depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a pruner and guardian of wonder. Her interiority is rendered through poetic but occasionally generic phrasing (“insatiable creative urge,” “heart attuned to the hush”), lacking concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. She acts with competence but no meaningful flaw or trade-off clouds her success, flattening emotional complexity. The final choice feels earned by lore, not personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in her role as restorer, and her internal conflict—lucid unrest versus resolve—is embodied through precise actions with the needle and net. Kael functions effectively as a pressure-applying secondary character, though his interiority remains thin by design. The final choice to continue teaching him feels earned, with visible cost implied in Elara’s lingering unrest. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the transition from unrest to calm lacks layered contradiction under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her methodical actions. Her internal contradiction (shielded yet open) manifests in micro-choices like comparing footage while guarding her heart. However, her emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward unearned epiphany (“silence not as absence but as a language of care”) without sufficient prior friction. Still, her arc culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses isolation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding the “physics of letting go”—is consistent, embodied in her actions (untangling wires, writing a note), and culminates in a credible renunciation. Her quietly analytic nature shapes decisions without over-articulation, though the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“sophisticated melancholy”). The cost of release is felt but could be more viscerally anchored in bodily sensation rather than conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—articulating unspoken needs through encoded graffiti—is consistent and emotionally grounded, yet her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; she acts with near-perfect clarity under pressure. The absence of tangible struggle or misstep weakens the credibility of her emotional stakes. Her transformation feels earned thematically but not psychologically, as no flawed impulse opposes her drive. Still, her micro-choices (using the bolt plate, layering symbols) reveal a hierarchy of values with subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied, with micro-choices (e.g., adjusting goggles, reading aloud) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her “warmly inquisitive” nature drives active engagement with the diary, not passive observation. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her resolve feels steady rather than contested. The epiphany about joy transforming anguish is earned through incremental decoding but borders on diagnostic phrasing (“joy wasn’t the absence of anguish, but its transformation”).

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rendered through his emotional cloud taxonomy, and his interiority avoids diagnostic labels by grounding feelings in sensory perception (“brass telescope cold and solid,” “dusty starlight”). However, his transformation from fear to purpose lacks a pivotal micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path—his epiphany arrives as realization rather than renunciation. The “quietly explosive” tension is stated repeatedly but never manifests in a contradictory action or embodied trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the lens through which her entire perception and motivation operate, grounding her fractal artistry in sensory substitution. Her internal contradiction—seeking to imprison the infinite while knowing its futility—is embodied in every brushstroke, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses her life’s ambition with quiet dignity. The ancestral coin and tactile memory feel organically tied to her competence without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak mars her epiphany; the cost of letting go is felt in her step back, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her curiosity drives micro-choices like examining the hopscotch board and cross-referencing the phrasebook. However, her emotional state remains largely static; the “sociable isolation” is named but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or meaningful trade-offs. Her competence borders on effortless, with minimal struggle despite high stakes. The final tremor of excitement feels earned, but no real cost or flaw complicates her path.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and interiority is vividly rendered through tactile metaphors (“driftwood nostalgia,” “mechanical pulse”), but her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction—her transformation feels earned yet lacks a tangible sacrifice or contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of mere unlocking for repair is credible, but the cost remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characters are vividly individuated through profession and voice (Jax’s skepticism, Kael’s insight), and Elara’s leadership is embodied in micro-choices like tracing chalk and rallying the group. Motivations remain consistent, and their collective arc—from doubt to unified effort—feels earned. However, the ghost’s interiority leans abstract, and secondary characters lack contradictory impulses under peak pressure. The final renunciation of despair is credible but slightly smoothed by lyrical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, rooted in witnessed endings and a desire to offer grace. Her flaws are embodied (“hands scarred,” “eyes holding the weight of eras”) and inform her final act. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene—her struggle remains lyrical summary, not simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reluctant duty and internal conflict are embodied with precision—her resentment, urgency, and eventual quiet acceptance feel earned. Her micro-choices (hurried assembly, ducking birds, timing impressions) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The shift from burden to purpose avoids epiphany clichés, rooted instead in tactile action. However, the final emotional recalibration leans slightly toward summary (“less like chains… more like a broken, beautiful song”) rather than fully dramatized sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—his symphonic perception and guilt over Elena’s death—and his micro-choices (kneeling, tracing foam, releasing the chrysalis) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, though the epiphany leans slightly tidy. His flaw (driving synthesis without sufficient caution) directly caused the accident, and the resolution accepts its cost through redirected purpose rather than erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to find where stories begin—is compelling and consistent, yet her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; emotions remain abstract (“weight of her motivation,” “mindfully scattered”) rather than viscerally felt. Her transformation is conceptually earned but not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final shift from vendor to guide feels asserted more than enacted. Diagnostic label-speak (“quantified absence,” “glimmering parole”) flattens emotional authenticity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through sensory metaphor, but his emotional arc leans on abstract labels (“sturdy brittle,” “sandpaper rough memories”) rather than embodied contradiction. His choices lack friction—subsuming remorse is declared, not contested—and the emotionally contagious trait imposes no real tradeoff. The final endurance feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a tangible path.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and emotionally grounded, with clear interiority rooted in empathy and cultural repair. Her "empathetically decisive" trait manifests credibly in her orchestration of the repair scene. However, secondary characters remain lightly sketched—functional but not fully individuated under pressure—and their internal contradictions aren’t dramatized. The final choice feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is conceptually rich but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her “helix-minded” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in-scene. The transformation feels declared, not earned via struggle—no visible cost to shedding her old self. Emotional states are summarized (“quaking in her bones”) without tactile specificity or irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s prism-mindedness and archivist identity shape her perception and choices with consistent specificity. Her motivation—to recover lost syntax—is compellingly tied to past failure and internal stakes. The “seeds of vigilance” function as both concept and psychological tool, grounding her transformation. However, her emotional arc leans slightly abstract at the climax; the cost of reentry is implied but not viscerally embodied in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her symphonically minded nature and manifests through embodied, specific actions—tracing bark, fashioning an instrument—that reveal interiority without abstraction. Her empathy in motion drives every micro-choice, culminating in a resonant act of creation that feels earned. The hedgehog’s uncurling serves as symbolic catalyst, not deus ex machina, aligning external shift with internal readiness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile precision and ritualized slowness.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and particular—his chess-tutor precision, embodied in micro-choices like pressing the worry stone to the lodestone altar, reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. His motivation (“discover beauty in the difficult”) emerges through action, not declaration, and his flaws (over-reliance on pattern, exile-induced isolation) complicate his quest without safety-hedging. The dent in the stone functions as both emotional anchor and physical record of struggle, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly softening the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in pacifism and a desire to understand silence as empathy. Her interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic abstraction (“path to empathy,” “catalog the varieties of silence”) that borders on label-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction. She makes micro-choices (tuning frequencies, focusing amid distraction), yet her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—more yearning than struggle. The final renunciation of noise for inner quiet feels earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s ambition and sensory sensitivity create credible internal conflict, embodied in her stained fingers and journaling ritual. Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging through tactile observation (soil scent shift) rather than abstraction. The final choice—accepting serenity in motion—is earned by prior struggle with the seed and sensory overload. However, the “failure” of germination lacks concrete stakes beyond abstract village belief, slightly weakening motivation’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his interiority is filtered through tactile observation rather than abstraction. However, his emotional arc lacks contradiction or struggle—his epiphany about resilience feels smooth rather than earned through internal friction. The broken arrow tip guides him without resistance, flattening agency. His final choice to document and share is credible but costless on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and profession-inflected (“cultivate foresight in action”), and his micro-choices (kneeling for the patch, shifting stance in wind) reveal hierarchy of values. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy—grief and resolve coexist without contradiction. The patch triggers a “jolt,” but internal conflict remains implied rather than embodied under stress. Motivation intensifies credibly, yet lacks the irrational friction that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her synesthetic perception and desire to “certify wonder as essential,” which intensifies credibly toward the climax. Her interiority is concrete and sensory-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she never wavers or faces a meaningful trade-off, weakening emotional complexity. The final act feels earned but without palpable cost beyond abstract fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—driven by failure, not glory—and his interiority avoids diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (arranging driftwood, pausing before playing) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the shift from “oppressive silence” to “full of potential” risks over-articulation without sufficient contradictory embodiment in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, trembling hands, layered grief and joy—and her contradictions (precision vs. disorientation, borrowing vs. wholeness) drive micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of borrowed selves earns closure with felt cost: “no longer borrowing, but whole.” However, the stoic cartographer’s loneliness amplifying disorientation feels slightly convenient rather than causally inevitable, nudging this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s jitteriness and yearning for wonder are embodied consistently, and his internal shift feels earned through the extended encounter. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—his anxiety dissipates cleanly rather than coexisting with new resolve. The traveler functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a crucible forcing hard choices. Still, micro-choices (adjusting the pendant, continuing the journey) align credibly with his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her mysticism feels lived-in, not archetypal. Her flaw (self-deception about her purity) drives the climax credibly, and her micro-choice to accept rather than resist the revelation shows a hierarchy of values. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: guilt surfaces cleanly without irrational resistance or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The epiphany, while earned, lacks the messy hypocrisy or self-sabotage that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in wistful love and sacrifice, and her micro-choices—especially inserting the amber bead and stepping into the portal—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“fingers tracing patterns only she could see,” “chill in her bones”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her resolve never truly fractures, flattening emotional complexity. The final renunciation is earned but leans toward purity over paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation is consistent and his quiet determination compelling, but his interiority remains largely summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The “azure defiance” is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. His transformation feels earned thematically but lacks granular emotional friction during pivotal decisions—especially the barter with the mage, which passes without internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is sharply defined and emotionally grounded, with his interiority rendered through embodied sensation rather than abstraction. His micro-choices—kneeling, touching the shard, raising it to stabilize the rift—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on truth over comfort. The final renunciation (walking away after learning the truth) carries visible cost: the burden of knowledge replaces the quest, achieving Earned Stasis. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the revelation resolves cleanly without lingering contradiction or ambiguity that would push this into the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s reticence and warmth are embodied through precise perception (“warmly observant”) and micro-choices (reading but not replying to letters, building a cairn of guidance). His motivation—to “bottle the feeling of safety”—is consistent and compels his decisive act of relighting the lamp. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: he fears the haunting yet acts. The final renunciation of fear in favor of duty feels earned, with cost implied in the lingering “luminescent ache.”

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—shaping a new dawn through ancient shadows—but his internal contradiction remains underexplored; his “shadowed elation” and prophetic visions lack embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The character feels archetypal rather than individuated, with emotions expressed through lyrical abstraction (“heart swelled with shadowed elation”) rather than concrete, contradictory physicality. His actions align with motive, yet no meaningful cost or renunciation crystallizes in the moment—he endures, but without foreclosing a tangible path. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but the single-POV interiority doesn’t compensate with sufficient psychological granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “quietly explosive” nature manifests in tactile reverence for dyes and the morpho wing, and his borrowed heart pulses with emotional and thematic weight. Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to understand story-magnetism, intensified by the transplant’s existential urgency. His micro-choices (aligning the wing, tracking sun trails) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over safety, understanding over comfort. The final realization feels earned, not epiphanic, as it emerges from sensory engagement rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through concrete sensory detail and embodied emotion, particularly in her tactile interaction with the sextant and dreams. Her motivation—rooted in loneliness and wonder—is consistent and compelling. However, her “quantified sorrow” leans toward diagnostic label-speak (“precise weight, measured in lost moments”) without sufficient dramatization of its emotional texture, slightly undermining authenticity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role and the realm’s decay, and her internal struggle—scattered memories versus urgent purpose—is embodied through tactile actions (hands on mica, voice cracking). Her final choice to sing despite fear feels earned, with clear cost: the risk of total failure if the song falters. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves from despair to resolve without meaningful internal resistance mid-crisis. The transformation is credible but leans slightly tidy for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior conflict—desire to connect versus need to hide—is consistently embodied and drives her micro-choices, especially her decision to attend the ritual while emotionally guarded. Her empathy is shown through visceral reactions rather than diagnostic labels, though the epiphany leans slightly toward unearned clarity. The elder’s dialogue nudges her insight without overriding her agency, preserving motivation. However, the shift from guilt to self-forgiveness lacks a tangible struggle on the page, softening the cost of change.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her noticing, guilt, and tenderness manifest through precise actions (untangling vines, handling bread) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation (“to find the sacred in the ordinary”) drives micro-choices that compound into meaningful agency. The journal discovery reframes her personal shame as intergenerational responsibility, earning her shift from passive witness to active custodian. Flaws feel lived-in, not curated.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his “gently meticulous” nature informs his actions throughout. Interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into abstraction (“heart ached,” “conjure meaning”) without fully embodied contradiction or struggle. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the single-POV execution shows focused emotional restraint. The final renunciation—accepting decay while preserving record—is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is idiosyncratic yet internally consistent, and her actions align with it. Her “curiously steadfast” nature is embodied through micro-choices (doubling back, pressing the fob to her ear) rather than stated. However, her emotional state lacks contradiction; she moves with near-preternatural calm, flattening internal conflict. The resolution feels earned but leans slightly toward conceptual elegance over visceral human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied consistently—her glow brightens with doubt, and her scientific method (taste-based navigation) reveals a character shaped by inquiry. Her emotional arc from detached observer to someone who carries “a calm, clear sky in her heart” feels earned. However, the man remains underdeveloped; his function leans explanatory rather than crucible-like, limiting relational pressure. The final pang of nostalgia is poignant but slightly abstract, bordering on diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion—charcoal-stained fingers, mnemonic ache—and her contradictory impulses (longing for creation vs. fear of mockery) act simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to draw the faces of her mockers “not with malice, but with understanding” reveals a hierarchy of values earned through prior causality. However, the transition from blocked artist to creatively unblocked feels slightly accelerated; the emotional shift lacks micro-resistance that would deepen credibility. The cost—carrying “auroral sorrow like a gentle dawn”—is felt but borders on lyrical abstraction without concrete behavioral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aria’s motivation—recovering lost conversations—is vividly rooted in personal loss and artistic practice, and her interiority is rendered through embodied details (trembling hand, wilting leaves). Her micro-choices (seeking candor to revive leaves) reveal a clear hierarchy of values. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: grief and hope shift cleanly without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The final renunciation isn’t tested by internal conflict—she simply receives revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied through her seasonal muteness and tactile engagement with the bells and iceberg fragment. Her internal drive—to preserve “the color of wonder”—is consistent, specific, and intensifies under pressure. However, her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism (“truth and wonder were intertwined”) without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene to fully satisfy the 9+ threshold. The final renunciation of speech for deeper listening is earned, but the emotional cost remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—resolving inner static via miniaturizing others’ fears—is consistent and intensifies into decisive action. His internal conflict (nostalgia vs. need for silence) manifests through embodied choices, like handling the fear-core with organic reverence. The final renunciation of caretaker identity feels earned, with cost embedded in carrying condensed fears. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from chaos to peace lacks irrational contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her belief that “listening heals,” and her actions align with this throughout. However, her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“heavy with history,” “whispers of forgotten things”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Mr. Hemlock’s grief is rendered with emotional honesty, but his transformation hinges on exposition rather than dramatized struggle. The final exchange lacks the friction of competing impulses—his unlocking feels inevitable, not earned through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is compelling and consistently embodied through her dance-decoding method. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; fear and defiance alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The epiphany about vulnerability becoming strength feels slightly over-articulated (“her vulnerability, once encrypted, had become her greatest asset”) without sufficient prior struggle to ground it. Her competence borders on effortless, reducing tension in high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to recover deleted memories—is vividly embodied through pressed wildflowers and concrete actions like digging in unstable gravity. Her internal conflict (desire to remember vs. pain of truth) manifests physically in trembling hands and fluctuating movement, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to accept her past feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the buried letters and ashes. However, the emotional shift at closure leans slightly toward quiet resolution over active renunciation, just shy of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; his actions align with purpose yet feel frictionless. The solitary summoner archetype remains underdeveloped beyond label—no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotion is asserted (“tranquil blaze,” “profound relief”) rather than embodied, leaning into diagnostic phrasing. Final endurance reads as competent ritual, not earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to learn the language of old buildings—is vividly embodied and consistently drives action, while Finch’s spectral presence and role as tutor feel inevitable rather than contrived. Their relationship functions as a crucible: the “agreed upon lies” create mutual vulnerability that deepens with each tea session. The final renunciation—accepting mentorship from a ghost—carries emotional weight and forecloses ordinary understanding, earning an Earned Stasis. Minor deduction for Finch’s interiority remaining slightly opaque, though this aligns with his ghostly liminality.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict—between skepticism and emotional need—is credibly rendered. However, her transformation leans on abstract declarations (“ghostly resolve solidifying into steady courage”) rather than embodied choices under pressure. The memory flashback is vivid but functions more as exposition than a crucible forcing micro-decisions. Her final independence feels asserted rather than earned through specific, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and emotionally embodied, particularly in her trembling hands and conflicted reflections on “calibrated treason.” Her micro-choices—pressing the thorn, whispering forgiveness—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the shift from guilt to liberation lacks sufficient friction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The phrase “wisely enduring” reads more as label than demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his perceptive nature, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his sorrow remains a mood rather than a competing impulse. His choices (singing, listening) align with his goal but feel inevitable rather than pressured. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, yet emotional progression leans toward lyrical stasis over dynamic struggle. His final endurance carries cost (“weight of sorrow”), but the path to it lacks micro-choices that foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to salvage purity from emotional wreckage—is embodied in his careful truth-weaving and dream analysis, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His micro-choices (e.g., how he recounts Elias’s final act to Anya) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: protecting the living from raw pain while honoring the dead. Interiority remains concrete (“borrowed starlight,” “wavering light upon walls”) without abstraction. The only limitation is minimal on-page friction between his desire and competing impulses—his path feels slightly too assured.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation to honor hidden labor is consistent and embodied through ritual actions, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—his epiphany feels serene rather than wrestled. The character remains a vessel for theme more than a person with blind spots or struggle. His micro-choices (whistling, tea ceremony) align neatly with his philosophy without friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is consistent and compelling, rooted in his identity as a truth-seeker, and his final choice—bearing the burden alone—is earned through his prior actions and skepticism. His interiority is concrete (“fingers numb from the chill,” “sharp eyes caught a pattern”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The story shows contradictory impulses: desire for truth vs. awareness of its cost. However, his emotional arc lacks deeper irrationality or hypocrisy; his transformation feels slightly too rational for the high-stakes revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—shaping a new dawn from ancient shadows—is consistent and compelling, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in-scene; she shifts from isolation to action without sufficient micro-choices revealing competing impulses. Her “lyrically prophetic” trait feels asserted rather than dramatized through struggle. The final renunciation of solitude carries emotional weight but leans on summary (“no longer lonely but not quite belonging”) rather than granular cost. Still, her arc shows credible endurance with a legible shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s motivation—atonement through preservation—is clear and consistent, rooted in a credible past as a fallen bard. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; regret and hope are embodied in trembling hands and the ritual of jarring sounds. However, his transformation lacks a decisive internal contradiction in-scene—his “gleaned redemption” arrives smoothly, without resisting impulses that would complicate his arc. The final shift feels earned but slightly unearned in its ease.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s “logically emotional” nature is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in action—his choices remain uniformly competent and unconflicted. Motivation is clear but lacks friction; the artifact’s protection feels dutiful rather than fraught with personal cost. Interiority leans on label-speak (“logically emotional,” “ethereal grace”) without embodied contradiction. Final endurance reads as skilled execution, not a renunciation with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her impatience “sculpted” into calm, her vigilance made tactile through boots on metal—but her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The micro-choices (aligning the lodestone, folding charts) reflect her creed with precision, yet the absence of genuine resistance or doubt softens the cost. Her motivation is consistent and deeply personal, though the internal conflict remains more stated than dramatized under pressure. Still, her arc culminates in a credible Earned Stasis: patience as forged discipline, not passive waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict—fortified vulnerability versus systemic control—is embodied through micro-choices like clutching the ledger and refusing Thorn. However, her emotional state occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“fortified vulnerability,” “watchfully calm”) that borders on label-speak rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The ancestral memories deepen her resolve but verge on convenient epiphany without sufficient friction between past and present selves. Still, her final refusal feels earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chaplain’s guilt and penitent drive are embodied through tactile detail (“cradled,” “thudding a slow, penitent rhythm”) and micro-choices (declaring “I want to learn”). His internal contradiction—offering comfort yet feeling undeserving—is sustained without therapy-speak. The elderly woman exerts subtle pressure as a foil, but her role remains functional rather than deeply interactive. Final renunciation of passivity is earned by his hands-on labor, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—ringing an unheard bell—is vividly rooted in her species’ history of ignored warnings, and her “steadily curious” drive fuels concrete choices (inserting the arrow tip, decoding via kaleidoscope). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through embodied awe and laughter. The hunter’s arrow tip transforms meaningfully from weapon to key, revealing her values. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her resolve feels singular, not torn.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role and obsession, driving concrete actions like lying for access. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using embodied perception (“sensed absence,” “brightly attentive nature zeroed in”). The final renunciation—accepting silence over resolution—is earned by her discovery of institutional erasure. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves linearly from curiosity to resignation without internal friction that would push this into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to map empathy onto action—is compellingly embodied in his calm intuition and decisive choices, especially when he chooses to soothe rather than destroy the leviathan. His internal contradiction (peacekeeper bound by shadow, yet driven by care) is subtly rendered without diagnostic self-awareness. However, his emotional progression lacks friction; his calm remains untested under true stress, flattening the cost of his final act. The shard’s reconstitution feels more like revelation than struggle, undercutting the “genuine struggle” criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, breath misting, frayed nerves—and her motivation evolves credibly from euthanasia intent to purposeful salvage. The parasol tip and “fold in patience” anchor contradictory impulses: surrender vs. engagement. However, the shift lacks a decisive micro-choice that visibly forecloses her original plan; it’s implied rather than enacted under pressure. Her transformation feels earned emotionally but not causally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich but leans into diagnostic phrasing (“nurture intersubjective understanding,” “passionate subtlety”) that borders on therapy-speak, undermining embodied contradiction. The sentinel’s emotional arc feels reflective rather than pressured—his micro-choices (e.g., walking to the pavilion edge) lack tangible cost or tactical consequence. Motivation is consistent but abstract, not rooted in urgent need. The final stance is credible but not compelled by escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—his “strangely honest” nature drives his preservation of wisdom—but his interiority remains abstract, relying on labels like “selfless” rather than embodied contradiction. His final act of removing the mask briefly shows vulnerability, yet emotional stakes feel muted by lyrical distance. The story avoids therapy-speak but leans into epiphanic summary (“his motivation… transformed into quiet stewardship”) without dramatizing the shift. A meaningful endurance is earned, though cost is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her belief that art can reshape memory, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she moves smoothly from observation to impact without struggle. Mr. Hemlock provides emotional pressure, yet Elara’s calm remains untested by genuine resistance or doubt. Her choices align with her traits, but the absence of flawed hesitation or misstep flattens her humanity. The final renunciation (empty map case) carries quiet cost, though it feels granted rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s reticence, weathered innocence, and obsessive motivation are vividly embodied through precise actions (tapping the crystal, documenting sequences) and sensory perception. Her internal contradiction—intellectual weariness versus enduring hope—fuels credible micro-choices under pressure. However, her transformation from silence to testimony lacks a tangible struggle; the shift feels emotionally smooth rather than hard-won. The final act of speaking is resonant but not deeply costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The junkyard prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness creates a compelling interior contradiction: he seeks to capture an elusive sound yet cannot retain the visions guiding him. His micro-choices—placing driftwood, sketching with chalk—are consistent with his flawed cognition and deepen his tragic pursuit. Emotion is embodied in tactile details (chalk as “tiny weapon,” tidal longing) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the final realization arrives with slight ease, bordering on epiphanic neatness despite the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—harnessing the ephemeral—is rooted in her identity as a sage repairer and intensifies under pressure. Her internal contradiction (embracing chaos while embodying constancy) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Emotions are embodied (“luminous ache”) without therapy-speak, and micro-choices (using a leaf-fall recording to trigger recalibration) reveal her hierarchy of values with visible cost: she sacrifices temporal stability to capture transience. The final renunciation—accepting lingering ache as purpose—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with micro-choices (smoothing sheets, selecting songs) revealing her hierarchy of values. Alistair’s emotional arc feels earned through embodied reactions to sensory cues like the vinyl shard and jasmine. However, his transformation leans slightly on therapeutic idealism—his rapid reconciliation with Lena lacks friction or resistance that would deepen credibility. The “decisively kind” trait borders on diagnostic label-speak but is mostly grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her curiosity about the shadows drives every action—but her internal conflict lacks contradiction or embodied tension. She acts with quiet competence throughout, showing little struggle or flaw that complicates her choices. The final decision to forge a new key feels earned but not costly in a personal, emotional sense. Her scholarly identity is well-embodied, yet her emotional arc remains smooth, avoiding the messy irrationality that would deepen authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her skepticism, grief, and yearning manifest through tactile actions (clutching the tooth, pressing it into earth) and sensory memory. Her motivation intensifies credibly from sorrow to purpose, culminating in a renunciation of passive grief that forecloses her former self with tangible cost. The “shrewdly innocent” descriptor operates as both observation and emotional compass, guiding forgiveness without sentimentality. Minor deduction: the bone-setting metaphor edges toward diagnostic label-speak but is swiftly grounded in ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent: to share gentle, non-consuming light. Her internal conflict—solitude versus connection—is embodied through tactile actions (polishing sea glass) and specific memories, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to leave the grotto feels earned, with visible cost in relinquishing her isolated sanctuary. However, her emotional shift lacks a contradictory impulse acting *in scene*—her acceptance arrives smoothly, slightly undercutting the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her watchfulness, vulnerability, and resolve emerge through embodied perception (“honeyed hush,” “fragile courage shielded by stillness”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to graft meaning onto exposed wounds—is dramatized through micro-choices: drawing the pendant, offering it silently. Leo’s shared fatigue and mirrored vulnerability deepen their crucible without over-explaining. The only restraint preventing a 9+ is the slight safety in their mutual understanding—no friction tests the limits of their trust.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict—creative stagnation versus purpose—is clearly established and embodied through her actions with the seashell. However, her emotional progression leans on abstract labels (“conflicted,” “lucidly watchful”) rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The resolution feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her transformation is smooth but slightly tidy for a high-stakes creative crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a whimsical tinkerer seeking to restore sacred practices. However, her internal conflict lacks contradiction—she moves seamlessly from intention to success without meaningful struggle or flawed choices. Emotions are embodied through sensory detail (e.g., the cool tendril), but her competence borders on effortless, reducing dramatic tension. The absence of genuine resistance or misstep undercuts the cost required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate heartbeats into maps—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with emotional specificity. Her patience is not merely stated but demonstrated through deliberate physical choices under duress, especially in the cold. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she operates with near-total clarity, reducing psychological tension. The lack of flawed missteps or genuine struggle slightly limits depth for a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his desire to preserve wonder through reason, and his actions—reverse-engineering the timer, documenting echo patterns—are consistent with his reflective, meticulous nature. His interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak and remains embodied in tactile detail (“hands... cradled a broken timer”). However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves steadily toward success without meaningful struggle or doubt that would deepen character complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied through precise micro-choices—kneeling, adjusting the lamp, orienting her inner self—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; emotions are rendered with poetic clarity yet verge on diagnostic (“boundary-lessly trapped,” “whalebone reverie”) without sufficient struggle or blind spots. Her transformation feels earned, though the absence of genuine error or misstep softens the cost. The final renunciation of being “trapped” reads as a quiet endurance (Earned Stasis) with felt expansion, satisfying the length’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The widow’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her carving is both ritual and resistance. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; grief manifests in precise hand movements, not exposition. The “hauntingly practical” trait governs her refusal to weep, aligning action with motive. However, her internal contradiction (holding vs. releasing) remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her eroded ambitions, regret, and chronological confusion manifest through tactile actions (twisting the camera wheel, wading into the lagoon) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation to negotiate with her ghost feels deeply personal, though the causal link between that desire and her past carousel choice remains slightly abstract. The final renunciation—leaving the camera wheel—is earned by accumulated emotional weight, not sudden insight. However, the ghost’s silence risks flattening the climactic negotiation into monologue without reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—“to puzzle out new equations for hope”—is compellingly rooted in his professional identity and emotional disposition. His “functionally creative” nature manifests through concrete choices: repurposing conduits, using the sextant as a calibration tool, rerouting water. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; his stoic wonder remains static rather than clashing with doubt or fatigue. The final renunciation (leaving the sextant) carries quiet cost but lacks a prior struggle that would make it feel earned beyond intellectual resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her nostalgia, regret, and tactile reverence for clocks feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (e.g., excruciatingly gentle touch on the crystal tile) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over expression, care over ambition. The renunciation of her musical dream is credibly earned through accumulated circumstance, not convenience. However, her emotional shift toward acceptance borders on tidy; the cost of silence is felt but not viscerally dramatized beyond sensory memory.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in generational trauma, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her clarity borders on preternatural. The “training instincts” method feels more like a label than embodied struggle, reducing friction. Her final renunciation of the literal quest is earned, though the emotional cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Still, her micro-choices (adjusting the sundial, interpreting the crack) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices—kneeling in snow, using fulgurite as a lens, adding her own knot—but interior contradiction is underdeveloped. Her infinite patience borders on static virtue rather than a tested trait with visible cost. The final shift from collector to guardian feels earned yet lacks emotional friction or sacrifice that would elevate it to 9+. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., tightening her grip on the thread), but her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“healing comes from honoring the empty places”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction. Her motivation—to map healing—feels consistent yet borders on abstract, though it gains specificity through her projection ritual. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but her solitude is effectively leveraged to deepen empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prince’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his emotional state is embodied through tactile details (calloused hands, trembling resolve). However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—his determination never wavers, flattening complexity. The final choice feels earned but stems from unwavering conviction rather than a struggle between competing desires. His transformation is credible yet leans toward epiphany over layered psychological evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her lineage and trauma, compellingly embodied through micro-choices (e.g., using black sand for grafting, gifting the coin). Her internal conflict—between inherited destruction and chosen healing—is rendered with specificity, avoiding diagnostic labels. The girl’s presence applies immediate relational pressure that crystallizes Elara’s compassion as action, not abstraction. However, the father’s “madness” remains underdeveloped, slightly flattening the inherited flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “luminous skeptic,” and her realistically imaginative trait shapes her methodical, grounded approach. Her internal contradiction—skepticism versus hope—is embodied in tactile choices (e.g., fitting glass shards, waiting for stars). The final renunciation of doubt feels earned through accumulated micro-choices under pressure. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from doubt to hope lacks a visible cost beyond abstract weight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly, rooted in her role as a keeper of fading cosmic memory. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied emotion—e.g., the cold brass gear against her skin conveys duty without exposition. The final choice to encode light into sonar pulses emerges from prior causality and carries visible cost: the garden’s irreversible fade. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her sentimentality lacks a countervailing impulse that would deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her gravestone carving, poetic lineage, and meditative focus—and intensifies credibly through embodied actions (unrolling ribbons, whispering poems). Her internal conflict between grief and transformation manifests through simultaneous impulses: seeking answers while honoring the dead. The grandfather’s spectral presence avoids sentimentality by functioning as a catalyst rather than a resolver. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from searching to peace lacks friction or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with guilt embodied through tactile memory (calloused finger tracing inscriptions) and micro-choices (refusing shortcuts). His ethical diligence drives every action, and the final self-forgiveness feels earned through decades of service, not epiphany. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy—trauma resolves with poetic symmetry rather than lingering contradiction. The searing reverie softens too cleanly into acceptance, missing a beat of resistant doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—“to discover the shape of intentions”—is compelling and consistent, driving her tactile engagement with the tapestry. Her interiority is embodied through precise gestures (“fingers gently tracing the fabric”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves from curiosity to resolve without friction or doubt, flattening the psychological stakes. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but her micro-choices (e.g., snapping the thread) credibly advance her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent—seeding innovation within constraint—and his internal conflict (fear of chaos vs. desire for change) manifests in embodied hesitation and micro-choices (quill trembling, model refinement). His “groundedly imaginative” nature informs every decision without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of writing is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the relinquishing of control over how his narrative will be received.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—reviving stories in a famine—feels urgent and consistent, rooted in her identity as a copyist. Her interiority is concrete (“pulse quickening,” “dust motes dancing”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The decision to embed codes in scores shows credible escalation under pressure. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily from longing to action without internal resistance that would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—charcoal-dusted hands, jagged porcelain biting palms—and her motivation (crystallizing fleeting emotion) coheres with her ritual. Her attribute of weaving truth by omitting harsh edges directly shapes her portrait’s construction and emotional arc. However, the grandfather exists only as memory; without on-page interaction, their relationship lacks reciprocal pressure. The final choice feels earned but leans slightly on reflection rather than active confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her fear of cultural erasure, and her internal conflict between doubt and determination feels lived-in. However, her “agonizing” remains largely abstract rather than dramatized through micro-choices that alter tactics; she scrapes sediment and inscribes notes, but these actions lack tangible trade-offs or visible cost beyond emotional weight. The cog functions more as symbol than catalyst for decision. Her rational rebellion is stated more than enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “expectantly resigned” state, tactile memories, and moral reckoning feel lived-in. Her motivation to braid voices emerges from specific history, not abstraction. The choir’s transformation hinges on her credible choices, especially her decision to use the rosette as pedagogical artifact. However, the students remain a mosaic without individuated pressure, slightly limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her “gentle rebellion” against forgetting drives her actions—but interior conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; emotions are labeled (“lingering sadness”) rather than embodied under pressure. Her pruning acts as metaphor more than micro-choice with tangible cost. The trait “informally wise” remains declarative, not demonstrated through flawed judgment or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness and devotion to wonder are consistently embodied, not merely stated, and directly motivate her actions. Her micro-choices—reading the riddle aloud, climbing the tower, reciting it as a chant—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost (risk, effort, emotional vulnerability). Kael functions effectively as secondary pressure, but his interiority remains thin; however, this is acceptable under Track A scope. The final renunciation isn’t of wonder but its reaffirmation, which feels earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, sensory-driven observation and childhood memory, compelling her ritualistic action. Her interiority is concrete (“noticer of creeping normality”), and her micro-choice to place the orris root enacts a hierarchy of values—sanctifying forgotten spaces over personal safety or convention. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves with near-certainty, missing friction between belief and doubt that would deepen credibility. The epiphany feels earned but leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The statue’s motivation—“to welcome nuance into the certainty of its solitary duty”—is consistently embodied through telepathic exploration and tactile interaction with the ampoule and garden. Its internal conflict between rigid guardianship and adaptive compassion is rendered without diagnostic labels, using concrete actions like threading essence through structural weaknesses. The final choice to weave protection “through vulnerability” feels earned by prior discoveries, especially the voluntary nature of its transformation. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from isolation to community lacks friction or misstep that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “grim optimism,” tactile focus on the chipped die, and precise scholarly daring feel character-specific. Her motivation (capturing a missed opportunity) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: rolling dice as stochastic input, adjusting proofs, laughing at revelation. The final renunciation of chasing ghosts is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her acceptance of finitude. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (daring vs. calculation) act simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her insomnia and belief in kindness’s endurance. Her interiority is vividly embodied—humid air clinging to skin, brush shimmering—but leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction. Micro-choices (painting specific memories) reveal her values, yet emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy; her hope remains unchallenged. The final renunciation of sleep feels earned but carries minimal felt cost beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s historically oriented nature drives tangible choices—her restoration work, use of the opera glass, and reconstruction attempts—all grounded in embodied struggle. Her motivation to rescue dying arts is credibly conflicted by repeated failure, culminating in a micro-choice (examining the lens casing) that feels earned. Internal contradiction manifests in her oscillation between archival certainty and creative desperation. The final act of baking the bread reconfigures her role from preserver to practitioner, with the cost of isolation and near-despair legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent—her rebellion against linear time drives every action. Her “neatly inventive” precision contrasts beautifully with the chaos she unleashes, revealing internal contradiction without exposition. The final choice to shatter fate’s mirror feels earned through her obsessive study of the yoyo and hunger stone. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile, sensory engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling voice, the clasp’s cold weight, the dictionary’s paradoxical notes—and her fear of hollowness after resuscitation drives credible micro-choices. The contradiction between “emptiness” and “potential” feels earned, not diagnostic. Her final declaration to the shadow reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort. No therapy-speak; emotional progression layers terror, hope, and exhaustion without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prophet’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (tapping driftwood, striking the resonator) and deepened by his calm response to the wave. His interiority is conveyed through sensory perception rather than exposition, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final smile carries quiet cost: endless labor with no respite. Contradictory impulses—urgency vs. stillness—are woven into his movements under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is deeply rooted in loss and intellectual inheritance, with interiority rendered through tactile observation ("fingers reading histories written in calcium and time") rather than exposition. His micro-choice to play the whistle not randomly but as a derived sequence reveals hierarchy of values: understanding over force. The final shift from solitary cartographer to communal translator is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing singular purpose. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in sunwashed dread that makes "the horizon swim."

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s emotionally rational trait is credibly embodied—her cold anger fuels meticulous work, and her personal parallel deepens empathy without over-explaining. Her micro-choice to photograph the marginal “veritas” shows agency under pressure. However, her flaw lacks tangible consequence; she faces no real obstacle or error, making her competence feel untested. The renunciation of silence (past) echoes but doesn’t cost her anything now.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “granite” exterior and “silt” core manifest in tactile choices (wading, sealing notes) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation intertwines personal loss with archival purpose, and his final act of burying his own dream feels earned, not epiphanic. The stoic sensitivity trait drives micro-choices (pausing at the fish’s ripple, resisting futility) with visible emotional cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; his surveyor’s precision shapes perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a logical page indexer seeking truth. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through touch, memory, and the stamp—and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The dappled resolve effectively conveys contradictory impulses (doubt vs. determination) without tidy resolution. Her final renunciation of imposed order for messy truth feels earned, with visible cost in her redefined relationship to indexing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—grief transmuted through craft—but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; emotions are embodied yet occasionally verge on lyrical abstraction (“luminous torment”) rather than raw, messy contradiction. Her micro-choices (polishing, folding) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost, and the shadow reattachment feels earned. However, the resolution leans slightly toward tidy emotional arithmetic rather than enduring ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is rooted in visceral trauma and sustained by a gnawing, embodied grief that avoids therapy-speak. His internal contradiction—seeking understanding, not revenge—fuels every micro-choice, from carrying the geode to initiating the pulse. The epiphany feels earned because it emerges from sensory overload, not abstraction. His final stillness conveys renunciation with palpable cost: the hunt ends, but the weight remains.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a yearning for belonging that intensifies through his actions. His “perpetually surprised” demeanor functions more as a repeated descriptor than a driver of contradictory impulses or costly choices. Interiority leans toward abstract yearning (“fractured world,” “inner truth”) rather than embodied contradiction, weakening emotional specificity. The final realization feels earned but lacks the friction of competing desires or flawed missteps that would elevate it to high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt is embodied with specificity—the watch hand, the driftwood carving—and her internal conflict between cowardice and conscience drives credible micro-choices (kneeling, tracing grooves, clutching tokens). Her flaw (erasing a brother to serve a client) directly generates the central cost: his lonely death. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“tempered regret,” “core of tempered regret”) rather than raw, contradictory feeling under duress, nudging it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, especially in her tactile reliance on the drawer pull and her burdened thoughtfulness. Her motivation—to recycle mistakes into wisdom—is dramatized through action and dialogue, not just stated. However, Kael’s shift from grim silence to emotional disclosure feels slightly abrupt, lacking a visible micro-choice that bridges his posture softening to his confession. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak but edges close with phrases like “uncommonly thoughtful” functioning more as assertion than embodied trait.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and emotionally embodied, with clear contradictions—pride vs. humility, regret vs. resolve. His micro-choices (paddling by utility poles, laughing after loss) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the repeated phrase “backlash of regrets” borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening emotional authenticity in key beats. The final shift feels earned, though the arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution given the depth of his stated brokenness.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s motivation—empathy as redemption—is clear and compelling, anchored in embodied gestures (tracing newspaper print, clutching the baseball). His internal conflict between jaded detachment and yearning for feeling manifests in micro-choices (stepping onto paths, throwing the ball). However, his transformation leans slightly on declarative insight (“memories flooded in—not as burdens, but as lessons”) rather than fully dramatized struggle, softening the earnedness of his change.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully rooted in grief and love, with interiority rendered through embodied sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. Her paradoxical steadiness under metamorphic stress feels earned, not asserted. However, Kael’s brief appearance lacks reciprocal interior pressure or status dynamics that would deepen the crucible of their reunion. The transformation’s cost is clear, but Elara’s pre-metamorphosis self remains slightly abstract, reducing the full emotional weight of her sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—repentance for lost time—is embodied with visceral specificity through the saucer, tablecloth, and cards. Her internal conflict (rushing adulthood vs. reclaiming innocence) manifests in micro-choices: aligning her palm with her mother’s, weaving time into cloth. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile ritual. Final renunciation—leaving the saucer—carries visible cost and earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifism and gravitational lightness are vividly embodied and directly shape her choices, especially when she suppresses joy to stay grounded during critical stitching. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak, using tactile metaphors (“stitch the fractured light”) that feel character-specific. However, her motivation lacks internal contradiction—she never wavers or questions her mission, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but her solitude is consistent with the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand the texture of transformation—is compelling and consistent, driving her pivotal choice to release the lightning bugs. Her interiority is concrete (“smooth, granular sand beneath her fingers”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the transition from destitution to peace lacks friction or contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation feels earned but borders on serene without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her “calmly inventive” nature informs her actions. However, interiority leans toward summary (“her motivation, long nurtured in secret”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics aren’t tested, but emotional states remain abstract rather than viscerally rendered. The final choice feels earned, yet lacks a tangible cost that reconfigures her options beyond success.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s precognitive curse and eel-herding vocation are tightly interwoven with his motivation and final realization, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His micro-choice to adjust the skewed rock under time pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—precision over panic—with tangible cost (numb fingers, fraying visions). The epiphany that “patterns were not just in the stars, but in the eels” feels earned through tactile struggle, not abstract insight. Flaws like obsessive fixation compound before resolution, grounding his transformation in consistent interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied contradictions (“furiously tranquil”) and micro-choices (writing the poem) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of silence is earned through prior pressure, though the ex-censor’s sudden appearance leans slightly on convenience. Her emotional progression avoids tidy resolution but borders on diagnostic phrasing in “mapping pain.” Flaws are present but not safety-hedged, and the cost—years of vigil, exile—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his mechanical arm twitching with calculation, his organic hand tracing angles—and his diplomatically fierce nature drives micro-choices like offering the scroll before fencing. His motivation to “turn questions into destinations” feels urgent and personal, not abstract. However, the opponent remains a shadow without distinct voice or pressure, limiting relational crucible depth. The final renunciation of rivalry is earned, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s molting identity and poetic mission are vividly rendered with embodied contradictions—her raw vulnerability and creative resolve coexist without tidy resolution. Leo functions as a credible anchor, though his interiority remains thin. The friendship feels earned through shared labor, not exposition. However, the final transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany (“luminous fracture widen”) without sufficient micro-choice buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—rewriting an unchangeable past through strategic creativity—is vividly embodied in his actions, especially threading the film and playing the precise chord sequence. His internal conflict (longing vs. agency) manifests simultaneously in tactile choices, not summarized. The broken clock and flickering compasses externalize his emotional state without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of passive grief for defiant creation is earned by prior causality with visible cost: time running out, arbor collapsing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in protecting cultural memory, but her interiority lacks concrete contradiction—doubt is named (“luminous doubt”) rather than embodied through simultaneous impulses. Her actions align with motive, yet emotional progression feels summarized (“felt luminous doubt… certainty shadowed by fear”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The resolution shows endurance, but the cost is abstract (fear of error) without tangible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—regret as “cerulean waters,” silence as a palpable weight—but his transformation leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“learned to speak them to himself”) rather than messy, contradictory struggle. Elian functions more as oracle than crucible; their dynamic lacks reciprocal pressure or status shifts. The final renunciation is earned through ritualized action, though the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.
