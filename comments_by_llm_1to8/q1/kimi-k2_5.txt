    Mara's interiority is densely present but often operates in therapy-speak register ("seeking the silence that could teach her how to be still," "discover purpose in the pauses"). The arc from suicidal despair to renewal is traced, but the pivot hinges on discovered journals rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion appears intermittently (frost melting, breath clouding) but peak moments lean toward summary and label rather than contradiction under pressure. The final choice to return and rebuild reads as decided off-page, announced rather than enacted with visible cost at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior world is vivid and embodied through thermal perception, creating a distinct character-particular lens. The core motivation—translating silence into visible music—drives her actions coherently. However, the final "recognition" moment feels slightly asserted rather than earned through a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path; she moves from isolation to reconciliation primarily through reflection rather than a dramatized cost or renunciation that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marian's motivation is clear and embodied through her thirty-year practice and her refusal to accept temporary death. The weary undertaker's "inadvertently stubborn nature" drives her crossing into impossible space without hesitation. Her final choice to become librarian earns closure through exhaustion lifting into silence, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth—the cost of abandoning her coastal parlor and earthbound practice could press harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior is controlled and her motivation (community survival through anonymous aid) remains consistent. The child's late arrival and Maya's decision to ring the bell show agency under pressure, but the transition from solitary anonymity to public declaration feels swift—the internal conflict between secrecy and visibility is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is present (breath misting, fingertips on cold metal) but the climactic shift lacks visible struggle; Maya "understood then" signals an epiphany rather than showing competing desires acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "spiritually curious nature finally satisfied" reads as narrator summary rather than embodied discovery. The past-life nurse appears as exposition to explain stored love rather than complicating present choices. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from setup to epiphany without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. His dissolution is described in abstract, conceptual terms ("atoms distributing along the hyperbolic plane") without embodied sensation or genuine internal conflict. The transformation feels predetermined rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path; he simply becomes what the prose declares he becomes.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's seventeen-year commitment establishes a coherent motivation, and the stance of "patiently strategic" guardian who refuses force is consistent. However, her interiority remains largely abstract—"preservation was the only currency" reads like a concept label rather than embodied contradiction. The scavenger's sudden hesitation at her "staggering grace" lacks prior causal grounding in his perspective; we see only Elara's dignified posture, not the internal conflict that would make his weapon-lowering feel inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to "find the sound of trust breaking" is clear and consistent, anchored in a specific past betrayal (the child patient). The synesthesia and cell-division metaphors provide embodied interiority. However, the final choice—fitting the device into her own ear—feels more like a logical endpoint than a high-stakes decision forged under contradictory impulses; she observes and accepts rather than wrestling with competing desires in the moment. The cost (her death) is legible but occurs passively alongside the discovery rather than being forced by an active renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is coherent—collecting illuminated moments rather than mere value—and embodied in her practiced movements. Her internal state appears in metaphors like "heart pressing against her ribs like a fist trying to reach through flesh," though this leans toward abstraction. The piece establishes expertise (three months learning flower codes) but offers minimal on-page difficulty or contradictory impulses; she succeeds without visible internal friction. The final act of listening to the portrait forecloses no live option with dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glassblower's contemplative temperament is established early and her dramatizing habit provides consistent characterization, but the interiority leans heavily on poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice to leave feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through on-page struggle; her "defense against crushing silence" is told more than tested. Micro-choices exist (handling the bookmark, placing it in a sphere) but they don't reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values with visible cost—she moves through her tasks without genuine friction between what she wants and what she fears.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kai's motivation to outwit the father is clear and the phobia-as-survival mechanism offers internal logic. However, the protagonist's emotional state relies heavily on assertion ("terror was different, intimate") and diagnostic framing ("phobias were not weaknesses but...adaptive survival mechanisms") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final confrontation choice—positioning near the rusted beam—feels engineered by competence rather than struggle, with no visible cost foreclosing another path. Interiority leans toward thesis statements about vulnerability instead of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The oracle's obsessive methodology is specific and embodied through seventeen years of cataloging silences, and her actions—arranging pebbles, pressing the booklet to her forehead—are concrete. However, the piece lacks genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she simply executes her established methodology without resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The final moment of success ("she had succeeded") reads as fulfillment rather than a choice with visible sacrifice, and her flaws never complicate the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Seven's motivations are legible but treated as philosophical abstractions rather than urgent pressures. The "remarkably composed" tag appears three times as label-only—no on-page tradeoff or contradiction emerges from this trait under stress. Internal contradiction is absent; the janitor-violinist merge reads as smooth epiphany rather than embodied struggle. The final choice (placing the bow down, resuming sweeping) carries no visible cost that forecloses a path; it reads as completion of a cycle rather than renunciation or alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to expose complicity is clear and embodied through concrete choices (extending tickets, admitting the cover-up). Internal contradiction appears when loyalty calcifies into suspicion, but the final choice feels slightly muted—she decides to file the report off-page rather than in a dramatized peak moment. Julian's desperation is shown through the doodles and his whispered confession, yet his interiority remains thin. The piece stays within two characters and avoids head-hopping, but emotional progression leans toward therapeutic articulation ("thaw mistrust with transparency") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly—proving gardens know their gardeners—but her interior life remains abstract, filled with elevated philosophical reflection rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The backstory about deceiving the eastern quadrant is told in summary; we never see her struggle with a present choice where competing impulses collide. The final act of placing marbles feels ritualistic but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options that would demonstrate genuine character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—proving sideways time—but his interior life remains thin. The piece tells us he's "indispensable" and names his three-year tenure without showing contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. Dr. Vex's laugh is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening what could be a relationship crucible. The final smile reads as validation rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear and embodied through sensory detail (water pulsing at her boots, tracing stains), and her musical intuition drives the climactic choice. Internal contradiction appears subtly: she documents decay yet seeks creation, though this tension could deepen. The choice to play feels somewhat inevitable rather than a difficult fork with visible cost; she faces no meaningful obstacle or renunciation. Minor deduction for the ghost's "acknowledgment" reading as external validation rather than internal change with foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is well-differentiated through her professional oracle framing and fever-recovery state, with embodied trembling and vision smearing. The motivation to measure her delirium's damage is consistent, and the final choice to center the illustration demonstrates agency with visible cost (moving from margin-dwelling to confrontation). Internal contradiction operates effectively through her history of rounding toward hope versus present acknowledgment. Minor deduction: the "complicity" realization in paragraph 5 edges toward diagnostic clarity that feels slightly over-articulated for someone just emerging from fever, though it remains grounded in concrete observations.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-specific: her skepticism manifests in how she interprets radio static as information-gathering rather than mysticism, and her exhaustion colors perception ("drowsy alertness...peculiar state") with embodied contradiction. The motivation—measuring the weight of Elias's confession—drives her deeper into the tunnel despite fatigue, and the beaded valve wheel discovery forces her to appraise both physical evidence and moral consequence. Internal conflict registers when she "refused to grant the universe that easy narrative" yet feels the workers as "absences shaping the space," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final turn—understanding she's become "the scale upon which such truths were weighed"—is earned by the sequence of radio interpretation, physical discovery, and documentation, with visible cost in the burden she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The chronicle keeper remains an abstract observer without concrete internal contradiction or embodied emotion. Her motivation "to witness change without judgment" is stated and repeated but never tested by a conflicting impulse or a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The final act—folding the swan and climbing back—reads as a return to equilibrium rather than an earned transformation. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interiority is specific and embodied—her calloused fingers, the locket ritual, her seventeen-year practice grounding her motivation. Milo's trauma and breakthrough are dramatized through embodied action (white knuckles, trembling finger, the whistle note). The relationship crucible works: Elara's patience and Milo's response create meaningful progression. However, the therapeutic epiphany arrives without sufficient internal contradiction or risk of failure; Elara's confidence never wavers, flattening what could be genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "sensitively perceptive" trait is named but never constrains a choice with visible cost; her actions—moving through the library, reading, transcribing—proceed without dramatized internal contradiction or trade-off. The weeping moment ("Elara wept silently") is asserted rather than embodied through specific perception or gesture. Her transformation from probing to transcribing unfolds as a seamless glide rather than a decision that forecloses a path, leaving the closure shift feeling declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias possesses a consistent interiority—his desire to "transpose life into a new key"—but his motivation remains largely abstract and label-driven rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The paradox that he orchestrates espionage "without knowing" flattens agency; his choices feel more like sleepwalking than genuine decision-making with visible cost. The final departure reads as something that "happened to him" rather than a choice he earned through prior conflict. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority is reflective summary rather than perception degrading under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Father Elian's motivations are clear—save the sanctuary by exposing hidden assumptions—but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("plumb the depths of this silence," "rhetorical devices that could dissect the architecture of belief"). Embodied emotion is scarce; we get philosophical posture rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to "release the final loop" feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The entity's defeat through logical paralysis is conceptually interesting but lacks the visceral struggle that would anchor Elian's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivation remains abstract throughout—he wants to "conduct unheard symphonies" but this never translates into contradictory impulses or a grounded choice with visible cost. The interiority leans heavily on metaphysical abstractions ("chronological homesickness," "logarithmic spiral of memory") rather than embodied emotion or concrete stakes. No meaningful internal conflict dramatized; the protagonist moves through epiphanies without struggle, and the ending grants total fulfillment without foreclosing anything. Diagnostic label-speak ("chronological homesickness...a disease of the soul") in a peak beat triggers penalty per anti-pattern guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is largely label-only ("crystallized intervals," "periodically eternal") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece asserts her fractured existence and ultimate unification through summary rather than dramatizing competing impulses in scene. No secondary character appears to pressure her stance. The final "smile" and acceptance read as declared resolution without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is richly layered—her numbness as "wearing gloves made of stone against her own soul" embodies emotional state without therapy-speak. The climactic moment where she touches the needle and "her heart began to keep time" shows contradictory impulses (terror and longing) acting simultaneously. However, the transformation from three months of silence to tears feels compressed; the micro-choices that shift her stance (placing hands on drum, touching needle) read more as passive receptivity than agency-driven decisions. The final realization is earned by the scene's causality but borders on epiphany convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's meticulous profession and her lateral evasion tactics embody character-specific behavior under surveillance pressure. Her internal processing shows contradictory impulses—fear versus scientific duty—though the interiority leans heavily toward conceptual abstraction ("atmospheric walls," "architecture for truth-telling") rather than embodied sensation. The mentor's survival and invitation dramatize a genuine choice with cost: continuing to record means accepting perpetual surveillance risk. However, key emotional beats are told through elegant metaphor rather than visceral contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's interiority is vivid and philosophically coherent, filtering perception through his wandering aesthetic ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety"). However, the final choice—"stepping sideways into the paradox"—feels asserted rather than earned through embodied contradiction; the poet observes and meditates but never faces a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. His internal stance remains consistent throughout, which supports voice but limits the arc of transformation required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is consistent—finding beauty in the unfinished—and manifests in concrete actions (gathering driftwood, placing the bowl, playing gaps between notes). However, the character remains largely static; her final understanding ("beauty had never required completion") reiterates rather than transforms her opening stance. The piece tells us she is "acoustically perceptive" but her internal process during performance lacks embodied contradiction or struggle that would earn the climactic insight. Interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("magnificence in the spaces where sound had not yet formed") rather than concrete sensory particulars filtered through crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority shows professional detachment ("affectionate detachment," "professionally thorough") repeated as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The client's transformation is vivid and physically detailed, but Kael's motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" is asserted more than tested through micro-choices with visible cost. The final moment where Kael commits to "experiments until all half truths become whole" reads as a tidy declaration rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path. Diagnostic label-speak ("counterfeit emotion dealer," "synthetic sorrow and manufactured joy") flattens the professional texture in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The transformation from shrewd broker to philanthropist unfolds via summary and reflection rather than on-page choices under pressure. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive") rather than embodied, character-specific thought. The final choice to fund the grant lacks a visible tradeoff or cost that would demonstrate genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("desperate to graft oneself onto community") but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The seventeen-cycle isolation is told rather than shown constraining present action. The weeping moment when Joss speaks is a gesture toward "boldly sympathetic," but it remains a single illustrative beat rather than a trait that creates visible tradeoffs. The final "offer" arrives without prior renunciation or foreclosed path—no on-page cost that makes the choice difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's goal to document the echo's birth drives her forward, but her interior life remains largely decorative—we see her trembling fingers and "terrible gift" but few contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The choice to release borrowed time feels motivated by the quest structure rather than by competing desires that create genuine tension. Embodied emotion appears ("fingers trembled") yet the interiority leans toward poetic summary ("precise burden of knowing") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final act of releasing time to uncage the echo reads more as task completion than a decision that forecloses a path with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is consistent—grief-driven search for his sister—and his "gently inventive" nature manifests in the glass-eye refraction technique. However, his interior remains abstract and label-driven ("mathematics of emotion," "geometry of grief") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization that "some equations solve themselves not by finding the lost variable, but by proving the equation was never broken" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through exposition rather than dramatized struggle. No micro-choices with visible trade-offs occur; he simply performs his ritual and arrives at acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's methodical nature and her motivation to help vulnerable others are consistently embodied through concrete actions (caching fragments, cataloguing with care). Interiority shows her recognizing the tape fragments' "sense memory" properties and connecting them to her grandmother's kitchen, though this reflection feels slightly prompt-directed rather than deeply character-particular. The final choice—distributing the recordings—emerges logically from her established traits, but no on-page contradiction or internal friction complicates her resolve; she executes a plan without visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece lands in the competent band but lacks the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's internal conflict between control and surrender is embodied through physical choices (releasing the leaf, planning to dismantle climate controls), but the transformation feels overly articulated rather than discovered. The "reluctant metamorphosis" is told through therapeutic self-awareness ("a sensation like roots cracking through concrete, uncomfortable and necessary") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her fifteen-year investment provides clear stakes, but the shift from micromanagement to witness feels too smooth, lacking the messy resistance that genuine renunciation demands. The final walk back carries visible cost (dismantling her system), though the ease of her acceptance undercuts the "reluctant" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's insomnia and compulsive art-making are embodied through concrete action (brushes moving, sketching from memory at the end). Her choice to exchange the brooch for the journals is motivated by her quest to "thresh meaning from experience," and the final realization that her vigil serves preservation ties prior behavior to closure. The mentor relationship and Maren's presence add pressure without deep development, but the protagonist's arc from compulsive witness to purposeful archivist is earned. Minor: the "wryly earnest" posture is told more than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is vivid and specific ("admission tasting like copper"), but her shift from pride in prediction to acceptance of uncertainty lacks the micro-choices and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would lift this to high bands. The pilgrim remains largely a vessel for transformation rather than a character with interior friction. Elara's final understanding arrives as insight but not through a visible on-page trade-off that forecloses a path with felt cost—she simply accepts what has already occurred.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's archival work and decision to give the valve to the woman show consistent motivation, and his reactively visionary nature is embodied through touch-triggered impressions. The internal experience is specific (mapping empty spaces, navigating absences), but the final realization about loss becoming legible feels abstractly stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The woman's transformation is clean, but Kael's arc lacks genuine friction—his insights arrive smoothly without visible cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is heavily labeled ("analytically artistic," "trembling certainty") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to board the train lacks visible cost on the page—she has "already carried her past the point of retreat" before deciding, so no path is foreclosed by her action. Backstory about the sister saturates the text but remains summary; the grief never tangibly alters a present micro-choice. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("every fiber," "heart hammered against her ribs in Morse code") and declarative epiphany rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's transformation from skeptic to believer is tracked through observable micro-choices (extracting the tile, pressing it to her forehead, designing renovations), but the arc lacks internal contradiction acting simultaneously. The final state shows her "courageously vulnerable in her newfound faith," yet the path from data-driven researcher to mystical guardian feels too smooth—no dramatized friction between her empirical training and the visions flooding in. The epiphany arrives fully formed without the messy hesitation or self-doubt that would mark genuine internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's immortal boredom and dimensional awareness are established early, but his interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("boredom calcified into something heavier than despair") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously. The motivation to discover "what happens after goodbye" drives the final choice, but the peak moment—stepping into chaos and receiving revelation—feels more like passive reception than earned struggle with visible cost. The amulet's role as compass/key and the decision to "find another to love" provide some agency, but the epiphany arrives without micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's mathematical mindset is established early and her internal conflict between honesty and deception shows promise, but her interior voice frequently slips into abstract philosophizing ("cosmic inversion," "algebraic proofs as metaphor") rather than embodied contradiction. The father remains entirely off-stage except as backstory, weakening the relational crucible. Key motivations—why she would drug a judge for a con-artist father—feel under-dramatized; the choice arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between her rigid morality and familial loyalty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve temporal textures through gold-leaf work is established and sustained, with embodied interiority in moments like "fingertips that knew only the weight of vanished things." Internal contradiction appears when he invents histories to "preserve the capacity for what might yet be," but the final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page pressure that forces a trade-off. The character remains consistent but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene to create visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's sensory filtering trait is established early and drives their collection method, but remains largely descriptive rather than creating genuine decision points under pressure. The motivation to "discover the texture of memories" functions more as thematic claim than dramatized want versus cost friction. The final affirmation ("understanding finally that to discover the texture of memories was to become the texture itself") reads as declared epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible forfeiture. Interior voice is consistent and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak, but the protagonist's choices never narrow options or foreclose a path with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's shift from skeptic to myth-maker is signaled, but the interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("architecture of understanding she had spent her life denying") rather than embodied contradiction. The core choice—walking into the fog—feels more like thematic necessity than an earned forfeiture with visible cost. Mara remains a motivating absence rather than a relational crucible, and the resolution to "reimagine everything" reads as epiphany-by-declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's dual allegiance is established early and her choices show internal contradiction (wearing both corporate badge and grandmother's tokens), but the interiority often defaults to abstract labels like "hopeful desperation" rather than embodied sensation. Her micro-choices—tagging walls, using the stone chip to score glyphs—show agency under pressure. The culture shock absorber role remains mostly decorative; we never see her actually translating or mediating between groups in scene, which undercuts the occupation's constraint on her choices. The final "smile" while adjusting her badge reads as tidy resolution rather than sustained contradiction with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—climbing, mixing reagents, refusing shelter despite hypothermic cold. Her purposeful curiosity drives micro-choices (kneeling to inspect fusion-glass, checking aperture, wrapping arms around heating coils) that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict between witness-duty and futility ("her curiosity had only served to archive extinction") operates simultaneously in the final descent. Minor slip: the grandfather's smuggled grain feels more symbolic prop than lived contradiction shaping present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's sensory method and guilt-driven motivation are established early and consistently shape her approach. However, her execution feels remarkably untroubled—the repair proceeds smoothly through specialized techniques without meaningful struggle or doubt that would test her character under pressure. The backstory about losing her sight and crew is told rather than dramatized through present friction, and her "magnetic calm" remains static rather than earning transformation through on-page cost. The final "anchor lifting" metaphor tells us she's released guilt, but we don't witness a choice that forecloses a path or changes her stance in a way that costs her something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlow's dry-witted precision and atlas-editor temperament are embodied through selective perception (condensation patterns as braille) and diction ("particular disdain," "herald the discovery properly"). The subtly confident stride and decision to walk the ice demonstrate agency under pressure. Internal contradictions are minimal; the protagonist remains steady rather than conflicted, which limits depth. The final transmission feels earned by his methodology and temperament, with the cost residing in solitary exposure and professional stake.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's seventeen-year commitment and final choice to place the fork against the keystone show endurance and decision with cost. Her interiority remains abstract ("infinitely patient by necessity," "motivated by the single truth") rather than embodied contradiction. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak, but internal conflict never acts simultaneously—patience is declared, not tested by competing impulses. Micro-choices lack visible hierarchy; her escalation to "quickened into a dance" feels asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared (finding her sister's signal, understanding the temple) but her internal landscape remains generic. The "override instinct" choice at the climax lacks embodied contradiction—no visible struggle between self-preservation and surrender, just a sequence of actions. The dead diver functions as exposition vessel rather than pressure source. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("ephemeral essence of human consciousness") that replaces concrete emotion under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority reads as performed rather than embodied—"thread a labyrinth with your own story" arrives as concept, not choice under pressure. The whispering campaign ("seven years whispering his narrative") is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. The murders in the cellar lack causal motivation visible in scene; we learn of them only as fait accompli, undercutting agency. Internal contradiction is gestured at (wolf's son learning silence) but never acts simultaneously in a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira's motivation is established and her interiority ("lovingly venomous," healing through pain) shows contradictory impulses, but her emotions trend toward poetic label ("mournful elation") rather than embodied action under pressure. Julian's sudden understanding ("terrible understanding," "gasped") accelerates too smoothly without genuine struggle or misbelief persisting long enough to cost him tactically. The final weeping-and-laughing simultaneity reads as a stock emotional endpoint rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks to repair the canyon through sewing—but her interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The story tells us she "had grown tired of broken precedents" and works with "orchid solace," yet these remain labels rather than visceral, competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final act of placing the plate and driving the stitch reads as completion of a task rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost. The piece would benefit from showing her wrestling with doubt or physical limits in real time, rather than describing her as "hauntingly optimistic" from a narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore faith is established and her warmly curious nature appears in concrete micro-choices (tracing the sundial, collecting gnomon fragments). The interiority occasionally tilts toward elevated abstraction ("cautious enchantment," "warmly curious insistence") that reads more like authorial labeling than embodied perception under pressure. The final prayer moment earns its weight through prior action, but the journey lacks genuine internal contradiction or friction—her curiosity flows smoothly without cost or competing impulses that would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is established through their work with the clipboard and decoding process, showing embodied attention under time pressure. The motivation to protect analog anonymity is clear and drives choices, though the internal contradiction remains abstract—we see urgency but little genuine struggle between competing impulses. The final act of leaving the chalk codes to erode demonstrates a value hierarchy, but the emotional stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. Character-particular details (ebony clipboard, occupation) are present but the arc reads as enacted premise rather than lived transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is established through concrete action (embroidering intelligence into star charts), and her "foolishness as architecture" creates a legible character strategy. However, her competence borders on frictionless—she never faces a moment where her method might fail or her disguise might be penetrated, which flattens internal conflict. The captain's instant comprehension feels convenient; we don't see Mira sweat over whether her oblique warning will land. Embodied contradiction is present in the performance/wisdom split but never tested with visible cost.

    Elara's motivation (to witness and speak unsent words) is clear and sustained, but her interior reads as elevated lyric register rather than embodied crisis—"anticipated grief masquerading as self-protection" is diagnostic label-speak, not lived contradiction. The moon-healing attribute is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction; she heals passively, eliminating potential cost. The final act (stepping into the vision, speaking) lacks genuine internal conflict: no on-page hesitation or competing impulse appears in the climactic beat, flattening what should be a wrenching decision into smooth execution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is established—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—and her work deciphering the cast notes shows professional interiority. However, her "shrewdly innocent" trait remains label-only without constraining a single choice; she never faces a dilemma between concealment and transparency. The boy is unconscious throughout, offering no relational crucible. Emotional embodiment leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's journey from shuttered artist to rekindled creator is embodied through concrete actions—kneeling to uncover the fresco, hanging film strips, painting with phosphorescent pigments. Internal conflict appears in "stubborn spark" after "years of ash," though the progression from despair to joy accelerates without substantial on-page resistance or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to carry the daydream "folded in her pocket" reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, meeting baseline motivation but not the Q1 9+ test of contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's interior world is rendered through heavy abstraction ("nested awakenings," "sliver of eternity where possibility hums") rather than concrete, embodied contradictions. The final choice—placing the nickel and growing murals from sound—lacks earned causality; we see no struggle between her restorer discipline and artistic impulse, only declarative shifts. Interiority repeatedly lapses into therapy-speak ("trade their answers for better questions," "generous space between knowing and seeking"). No visible cost forecloses a path; the "awakening" feels asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias displays some internal complexity—the "charming rogue scholar" who volunteers for surveillance shifts to plant resistance codes—but his motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final moment of capture shows him "smiling with the relaxed confidence" rather than embodied cost or genuine internal conflict. Dr. Voss and the forty club members remain functionally ornamental, applying no relational pressure that forces Elias to choose between competing goods. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("crystalline clarity," "fragile ecosystem requiring constant tending") flattens interiority at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's central motivation—to transform pain into beauty—is stated but largely passive; she sings and watches transformations occur around her rather than making difficult choices under pressure. The piece tells us she has "learned that grief was not an ocean to drown in but a garden to tend" and that she "chose to ensconce herself deeper," but these are declarations rather than embodied micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("to photosynthesize pain into beauty") rather than concrete, character-particular thought. The final transformation into reef bypasses agency entirely; she becomes setting rather than choosing within constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caretaker exhibits consistent motivation and her core action (using the cracked tube) shows purposeful agency. However, interiority remains abstract—phrases like "foxglove regret" and "cloud-mist carpeting" feel ornamental rather than character-specific. The final choice is signaled but lacks contradictory impulses in the moment; she proceeds methodically without visible internal friction. Embodied emotion is minimal; we're told about regret but don't see it complicate a single micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final choice to create the promise structure flows from established traits (cataloguer of extinct languages). However, interiority remains largely abstract: "cautious exuberance that fluttered in her chest like caged birds" labels rather than embodies. The reconciliation feels inevitable from paragraph one without meaningful internal contradiction—no moment where silence tempts her to retreat. Julian's acceptance arrives too easily; we see his widened eyes but no struggle between caution and hope that would make the choice costly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is motivated by discovered compassion and clear technical expertise, yet his interior life reads largely as reportage rather than embodied contradiction. The "conspiracy of kindness" framing arrives close to diagnostic label-speak ("profound emotional weight," "slyly heartfelt") and his trembling hands function more as stage direction than visceral stress. The final choice to falsify reports is stated but not dramatized with visible cost on the page—no supervisor confrontation, no peer discovery risk made concrete. Competence overwhelms struggle; he executes flawlessly without genuine on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal motivation is established—preservation of lost songs versus flight—but her interior voice relies heavily on elevated diction ("symphony older than humanity," "suspended between floors") that reads more lyric than character-particular. The final choice to send Orion north is visible on the page with cost (she stops hiding, descends to face consequences), meeting baseline agency requirements. Interiority remains abstract through much of the middle; embodied contradiction is limited to a few gestures (trembling fingers, touching the meteorite) rather than sustained contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand thresholds is present but her emotional interiority reads ornamental rather than contradictory—"featherly determined" functions as poetic label without cost. The father's maze becomes a sanctuary concept told through exposition rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that force tradeoffs. Internal conflict is implied in the phrase "lost child, though 'lost' implied she wished to be found, which she did not" but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final threshold crossing feels inevitable from thematic design rather than from prior choices that foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find belonging is declared but her micro-choices under pressure feel thin; the decision to collaborate with the phantom emerges without friction or competing impulses. The phantom researcher solidifies slightly at the end without earning that transformation through prior contradiction or cost. Interiority leans on stock metaphors ("gravity of her mission," "belonging was not a place to inhabit but a frequency to match") rather than character-specific perception, and the therapy-speak final insight ("resonance between separate souls") replaces embodied choice at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's occupation is colorful but her interiority remains abstract—she "wonders," "realizes," and "knows" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The missing-pieces motif is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final acceptance arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed; she simply continues her work in the same way. No secondary character applies pressure, leaving motivation unopposed and static.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael is presented as an orchestrator with clear motivation, but his characterization relies heavily on telling rather than embodied contradiction. The woman in gray receives three evenings of observation yet her "defeated posture" and "tears of recognition" remain generic labels without specific behavioral texture. The chess bishop functions more as symbolic prop than choice-driving constraint; Kael's actions feel pre-determined rather than pressured by genuine obstacles. Internal conflict is absent—he succeeds without mistake or cost, undermining earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelin's transformation is asserted rather than earned through embodied choice under pressure. Her interiority consists of declarative philosophical statements ("she understood then that her exile had matured") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final transformation into "a being of pure, written light" is told through abstract labels without visible cost or micro-choices that would make the renunciation credible. No genuine struggle or foreclosed path is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his profession shapes perception ("reading between lines of cracked silica"), but the decision to commune feels declared rather than dramatized—no visible struggle over whether to retire, reconcile with his daughter, or continue working surfaces in micro-choices. The reflective rings-as-metaphor beat conveys insight through embodied observation, yet the final "ready to read between the lines of whatever cracks the day would bring" suggests acceptance without a foregrounded internal contradiction acting in scene. Emotional embodiment is present (trembling hands, sleepless hours) but the peak recognition moment leans toward epiphany assertion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior voice is distinct and her scars function as embodied history, but the piece leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("constellations that rivaled the stars") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Elias remains functional but thin—his breakdown is told more than shown, and his transformation from frozen recruit to someone who "stood straighter" happens too quickly without contradictory impulses in scene. The marble exchange and Maya's decision to share it demonstrate agency, but the final beat's wisdom ("Everything that carries fire is") edges toward aphorism rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara exists as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a character with embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Her "logical dreamer" trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested through conflicting desires or mistakes under pressure. The final act—sitting exhausted but vigilant—offers no visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path; she simply completes her work. Interiority consists of philosophical meditation ("the burden of knowing that hope required not just wishing but rigorous calculation") rather than specific, character-particular thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's perceptive trait is demonstrated through action (listening, detecting vibrations, reading echoes), and her understanding evolves from technical mapping to emotional archaeology. The character makes choices that advance the narrative—descending to the vault, studying the negative—but internal contradiction is minimal; she processes discovery in a steady, contemplative register without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "carry the past so the walls could finally rest" feels thematically stated rather than dramatized through a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page. Embodied emotion appears selectively (burden pressing against chest) but much interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is defined primarily through lyric description ("creature who existed only in the refraction") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed heartbeat mechanism provides a constraint, but his interior experience remains externalized and abstract—"perceptively calm" is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The ending forecloses his presence with visible cost (the heartbeat fades, he vanishes), meeting baseline closure requirements, but the choice to leave feels inevitable rather than earned by prior contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are established through backstory (military strategist turned peace negotiator) but her interiority remains abstract—labels like "operatively gentle nature" and "weight of collateral damage" tell rather than show internal contradiction acting in scene. The general and young commander remain instrumental, applying pressure without their own contradictory impulses. The final choice (planting seeds, passing the clipboard) feels engineered by the ritual rather than earned through Elara's visible struggle between competing goods; the path to this solution is narrated more than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is rendered with strong internal contradiction—mourning extinct species while engineering their destruction—and the sentimentality is embodied through concrete actions (clutching the egg, tracing cracks, the burial ritual). However, the interiority leans heavily on exposition ("a sentimentality he guarded more fiercely than his offshore accounts") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The final act of walking away without looking back carries some weight, but the cost feels asserted more than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lys possesses clear motivation (preserving virginity as resistance, harvesting echoes to defy conformity) and the final act of entering the sanctuary and gathering echoes demonstrates agency. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("bodily poetic," "verses in the air") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece tells us she is resistant but does not dramatize internal conflict or a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Backstory exposition (House of Twelve Sighs, Empire's song) anchors present choice but occupies significant real estate without micro-choices that alter present options until the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is established and his arc from puppeteer to listener is clear, but the change feels partially asserted rather than fully dramatized. The blind storyteller encounter compresses his realization into received wisdom rather than embodied struggle. Internal contradiction appears in his self-deception about "exploring ethics," but the pivot to understanding happens too quickly after one story. The final renunciation (burning puppets and scripts) carries symbolic weight but minimal visible cost—no dramatized consequence of what he loses by ending his troupe.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly textured and specific to her philosophy ("esoteric realist"), but the character remains observational rather than tested by internal contradiction. Her motivation to honor overlooked histories is consistent throughout, yet no competing impulse or genuine doubt challenges her dedication—she proceeds through ritual without friction. The final smile at paradox reads as contemplative insight rather than a choice earned through struggle. Embodiment is strong (moss pressing into knees, give of chitin), but the lack of dramatic tension between want and cost or fear keeps this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior world is concrete and rooted in embodied craft—fingers stained, movements technically gentle, grief transformed to purpose. The backstory of the failed death-mask is purposeful and directly motivates present action. However, her emotional arc moves too smoothly from frozen regret to flowing purpose without messy contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final smile and "ice in her heart finally melted" reads as a tidy emotional resolution that lacks the ambiguity and cost visibility required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Foresight Hindsight's interiority is filtered through elevated, lyric diction that occasionally abstracts pressure ("directives decay…because they refuse to dream"). Her choice to leave the bunker is signaled but feels more driven by poetic realization than embodied contradiction under stress. The mushroom preparation and departure show agency, yet micro-choices lack visible internal conflict or cost that would ground the mystical stance shift. The final renunciation of the bunker reads as thematic inevitability rather than a choice forged through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elior's frugality and empirical nature are established early and drive his final action, though the seventeen-year backstory and his "miserly precision" remain largely told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The internal contradiction between rational skepticism and mounting wonder operates cleanly in the climax when he realizes "his life's parsimony...had conserved exactly the faith required." His transformation from hoarder to spender lands with visible cost—blood mixed with quicksilver—but the path feels more contemplative than conflicted, with minimal on-page struggle between competing impulses before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's interiority is saturated with abstract philosophical language ("architecture of compassion laid like trapdoors beneath violence," "mathematics of return") that reads as conceptual assertion rather than embodied thought under pressure. The entity materializes as pure allegory—"resentment given human form"—with no contradictory impulses or individual texture. Elias's final act of "winding" the entity feels like symbolic choreography divorced from earned psychological causality; the entity's surrender ("shoulders dropping") arrives through exposition rather than a dramatized internal fracture. The protagonist's scheming pacifism is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal competing values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to capture the dream is clear and his embodied actions (breathing, glass-blowing) anchor interiority, but internal contradiction is minimal—he proceeds methodically without genuine conflict between impulses. The "firmly grounded" trait appears as repeated assertion rather than a flaw that complicates choices. The final act of containment feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle; no visible path is foreclosed with felt cost since the dream's capture succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is richly embodied through her professional expertise and sensory particulars (the quartz eyes seeing stress fractures), and her micro-choices—pruning water sprouts, securing the ribbon—advance the pressure. The grandmother and daughter remain ghostly presences whose interiority is asserted rather than dramatized, and the final shift toward acceptance feels slightly told ("She realized that bridging generational wisdom meant..."). The monologue to absent figures risks ventriloquism, but the embodied sap-and-dust finale and the ribbon-as-contract gesture earn the arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophizing ("nonlinear inheritance," "recursive logic," "simply complicated cipher") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The piece tells us she is "bewildered" but her actions—wandering, sitting, whispering—carry no visible internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The final "understanding" arrives as summary rather than earned change with felt cost. Motivation remains decorative label rather than lived struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to catalog gaps and preserve concepts is clear, but her interior landscape consists mostly of philosophical observation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The "carefully resourceful" trait appears as descriptive label ("resourceful as a spider") rather than through micro-choices with visible cost. Her decision to renegotiate with the mountain arrives without dramatized internal conflict—she simply "understood suddenly" and proceeds. The chrononaut receives no embodied interiority, functioning as symbolic fixture rather than character.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interiority is layered with contradictory impulses—seeking reunion yet accepting absence—but her arc relies heavily on abstract self-narration ("she was the chimera twin discoverer") rather than embodied choices under pressure. The final moment of grasping her twin's hand reads as summary wish-fulfillment rather than a credible on-page transformation earned by prior micro-choices. Emotional progression feels telescoped: grief and longing are told more than shown through concrete sensory reaction or micro-decision. The piece gestures toward internal conflict but does not dramatize it in scene beats that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "warmly methodical" nature is consistently shown through her archival work and careful manipulation of the rope, but the character remains more archetype than individual—we get research patience and reverence without contradictory impulses or genuine vulnerability. The evolution from "passive keeper to active participant" is declared rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible internal cost. Her competence encounters no friction; the rope reconfiguration proceeds without error, doubt, or tradeoff, flattening what should be a high-stakes manipulation of causality into a technical exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her goal-directed actions (singing to invert harmonics, adjusting pitch based on ice cracks) show purposeful agency under pressure. However, interiority relies heavily on exposition about what she "knew" and "understood" rather than embodied contradiction or flawed micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final renunciation—remaining to tend the silence—reads as earned endurance with cost (useless maps, permanent vigil), but the journey lacks visceral struggle or mistakes that would elevate the characterization into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove pattern over chaos is clear and drives her choices throughout. Her retrocognitive gift provides concrete embodiment through "backward echoes like a net gathering smoke," though the interior remains somewhat abstract. The escalating pressure as she climbs the tower and positions the prism shows agency under constraint. However, the final beat resolves through cosmic alignment rather than a character choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she completes a predetermined pattern rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("preemptively nostalgic," "aching already for the moments she was about to preserve") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The final transformation—"she was becoming the memory she had sought to preserve"—is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices (examining shadows, selecting the quill, using rainwater) are present but the stakes remain abstract; no genuine cost or forfeited path is visible on the page. The piece avoids stock phrasing but the emotional progression feels conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation—defiance against hopelessness—is declared but never contradicted or complicated by genuine internal conflict; he moves through the fortress with confident mastery, his "serious playfulness" label-only rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract statements ("filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness," "he could feel the despair pooling") without embodied sensation or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final descent registers no visible cost or foreclosed path; he leaves "his motivation satisfied" without having risked or renounced anything on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("gravity of hopelessness," "serious playfulness") in peak beats triggers deduction per Q1 guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is specific and her profession shapes perception, but her decision-making remains abstract. The narrator's motivation is clear yet their choices stay passive—observing rather than driving turns. The jade cicada exchange provides embodied weight, but the final "keep this" gesture feels more symbolic than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (Maya's need to document margins versus commitment) but never forces a costly micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to collect silences is established early and embodied through concrete action (climbing the ladder, hunting the gilded hush, pressing the doll against air). Internal contradiction appears in the "stretching contracted" tension between her father's fortress and her gasping need for horizon, but emotional interiority leans heavily on abstract poetic formulations ("claustrophobia coiled in her blood like a snake refusing the dark") rather than moment-by-moment embodied sensation under pressure. The final choice to keep the collected silence and find balance is legible but arrives through contemplation rather than a high-cost decision that forecloses a live path. The piece remains single-POV with interiority present throughout, avoiding head-hopping or stock phrasing, but the abstract diction in peak beats (gilded hush as "intangibly tangible," "stretching contracted peace") sometimes replaces visceral particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses or genuine struggle. The architect is present but remains a prop receiving the cure rather than a force applying counter-pressure. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("fluidly logical mind," "catalyze a transformation") that distances us from concrete thought and embodied emotion. The ending offers a change in the architect's state, but we never see Mara face a meaningful trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's profession and goal are clearly signaled, but interiority remains largely conceptual rather than embodied—we see her "knew better than to seek crowns" but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The choice to ascend feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through visible cost; no path is foreclosed. The "wisely adventurous" trait is asserted but never tested by a micro-choice that tilts present stance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to isolate in order to save Mira is established through backstory, and the palm-scar linking provides embodied specificity. However, interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("tender shadow keeper," "nest of cinders") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The teaching moment at closure—releasing Mira to breathe independently—reads as conceptually earned but emotionally abstract; the final renunciation lacks visible struggle or micro-hesitation that would ground the cost in embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear—escaping crypto-cult debt while tending mushrooms—but her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("quantum promise," "pressure vessel") rather than concrete contradiction. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is asserted in a single line without dramatizing the impulse through competing choices under pressure. Her final transformation feels declared ("she became the pressure vessel") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The ending's emotional arc—typing a message to her past self—lands as gentle resolution without wrestling with genuine internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and particular—"their fingers found the cylinder in their coat pocket, the carved handle warm"—but motivation operates primarily through declaration rather than contradictory impulses. The character performs righteous pursuit without visible cost or hesitation until the task is complete; no micro-choice tests commitment under pressure. Internal conflict is absent: Kael moves through the beats with singular focus, never wavering between competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Valen's motivation is clear and intensifies through the piece, driving his surrender to the choreography. Internal contradiction appears in his simultaneous withdrawal and hunger for connection, embodied in the armor-shedding sequence. However, the protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical register ("to freeze the wave function of hope") that feels asserted rather than lived, and his emotional progression from isolation to "shivering bliss" lacks intermediate embodied states. The final transformation reads as conceptual rather than felt, with label-heavy language ("his emptiness finally filled with the multitude of existences") replacing concrete sensory experience at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation—broken-hearted archivist seeking solace through examining lives—is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing dust, opening files, photographing patterns). Her interior progression from grief to hope is earned through discovery rather than declaration, and the transformation from "unable to discard" to "examined conviction" feels grounded in the accumulated evidence. Minor deduction: the final epiphany ("not merely a mausoleum...but a secret library") edges toward thematic articulation rather than remaining purely embodied, and the grief context could constrain more choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is presented with consistent traits—careful resourcefulness, obsessive preservation—but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("tyranny of indifference") and label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to activate the switchboard feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through visible internal conflict; his fear or doubt never surfaces to complicate the move. Motivation is clear and actions align, but the peak beats lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final stance (vanishing into maintenance shafts) reads as competence fantasy without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to counter the prophecy is clear and his dedication is embodied through his saxophone technique, but his interiority remains abstract—"vested hush," "negative space," "absence of tone" are conceptual labels rather than concrete sensory experience under pressure. The mentor's madness is told through memory rather than informing a present micro-choice that alters tactics. Internal contradiction is absent; he executes his method without visible doubt or competing impulse, making the arc feel like demonstration rather than struggle with embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to decode the message is clear and consistent, and his transformation is built through accumulative steps (collecting dust, pressing the needle, rearranging monuments). However, his interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical assertions rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The character's emotional arc—moving from orderly cataloging to wild release—reads as thematic illustration rather than earned struggle with visible trade-offs. No diagnostic label-speak appears, but the lack of genuine internal conflict or flawed decision-making under stress prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization is specific and grounded—her forty-year expertise with "frozen gears" and methodical patience come through in embodied action (calibrating the loupe, measuring hydrodynamic flow). The internal contradiction between wanting to "schedule spontaneity" and needing to "befriend uncertainty" drives the waterfall crossing, where she shifts from calculated risk to intuitive faith with visible cost (the tilting stone, the "impassable" leap). Minor deduction: the epiphany moment ("befriending meant release, not conquest") edges toward articulated insight rather than remaining fully dramatized, though the physical crossing immediately enacts it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life displays concrete particulars—calculating "kilograms of intention," working with "precise gravity that names exerted upon identity"—and her motivation to redeem Kael is embodied through physical alchemy. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract declarations ("balance required she accept," "regret made luminous") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice feels more announced than earned through prior struggle, and Kael materializes as a passive object rather than a force that complicates her resolve. Micro-choices under pressure remain scarce; Elara's work proceeds without visible failure or tactical shift until sudden success.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her emotional journey feels muted—she performs her role with little internal friction or surprise. The decision to press the crocodile's tooth into her palm and the subsequent offer of blood reads as ritual rather than hard-won choice. Secondary spirits are sketched but passive, adding texture without pressure. "Modestly fearless" is invoked but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's proprioceptive enhancement is established but her interior state relies heavily on label-like processing ("algorithm of forgiveness," "mathematics of mercy") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—walking forward after the strap falls—feels more like a declared resolution than an earned renunciation with visible cost. No secondary character appears to test motives under pressure, and the interiority reads as therapeutic self-diagnosis ("trauma responses," "somatic memory") rather than embodied crisis perception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated—honoring her grandmother's erasure—but her actual on-page choices lack meaningful internal conflict or cost. The work unfolds smoothly without resistance or mistake; she encounters no genuine obstacle that forces her to weigh competing values. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition") rather than embodied sensation or contradiction. The final act of "unfastening" Mara carries no visible price that alters Elara's options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's character is established through concrete actions—climbing the ladder, reading dust patterns, handling the mainspring—with consistent occupation-specific perception. Her agency drives the key turn when she installs the barrel, foreclosing the ringmaster's liminal state. Internal contradiction is present but muted: she's observant of the supernatural yet emotionally flat about it, which reads more as trait than pressure. The final choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than costly; no visible renunciation or trade-off sharpens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—compress eternity into a moment—but her interiority leans heavily on elevated abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to shatter the bottle and initiate rupture feels predetermined by the premise rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses. Micro-choices under pressure are present (aligning plates, pressing the sheet) but the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally felt, and there's no genuine internal conflict complicating her path. The final act of watching the rupture spread is observation, not a renunciation or decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is ambitious but often defaults to abstract philosophizing ("archaeology of forgiveness") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shift from revolutionary to custodian is declared more than earned through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the final weeping) but much of the arc unfolds in summary reflection rather than pressure-tested decision points. The motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" reads thematic rather than dramatized through conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life is present but relies heavily on abstract formulations ("mending what isn't torn," "invisible threads") that read more like thematic statements than embodied thought under pressure. His emotional state is asserted through generic descriptors ("trembling fingers," "weathered palm") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The protagonist's forty-year backstory and grandfather's dream-teaching tell rather than show character formation, and the peak ritual moment lacks genuine struggle—every gesture succeeds without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking impossible petrichor—but her choices feel predetermined rather than contested. The psychometry reading moment is told rather than embodied with sensory contradictions; we learn she "didn't hesitate" but never feel internal friction. The descent is richly described yet lacks micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. Her final smile registers satisfaction but no visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to honor timewoven alliances and scaffold complexity emerges clearly, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The night-long work session shows action but the internal conflict between imposing will and listening to material is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. "Perpetually learning" appears as a label applied three times without constraining a choice. The final walk home carries resolution but the path from stranded sculptor to pavilion commission lacks the friction of genuine struggle—the storm teaches her rather than forcing painful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's interiority is vivid and purposeful, embodied through her work and spatial movement. The transformation from "questions she never voiced aloud" to "silence contained conversation rather than isolation" shows earned progression. However, the mother remains abstract—a device for Lyra's realization rather than a felt presence. The final shift reads slightly too smooth; the grief-to-understanding arc would benefit from one moment of contradictory impulse under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—complete the circuit between past and present—but his interior experience flattens into heavy abstractions ("haunting possession," "erosion of temporal reality") rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance ("not a curse but a communion") reads as stated epiphany rather than enacted cost; we're told he accepts the weight but don't see a micro-choice that forecloses an option. The retrocognitive trap constrains him physically, yet his agency remains passive observation until the closing arrangement, which arrives too late to build choice-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to reimagine civilization is signaled early and her rejection of "false comfort" drives the peak choice, but interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical narration ("the physics of lantern-light, the acoustics of laughter") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—pressing memories into the bottle—reads as willed rather than torn from competing impulses; she never wavers or pays a visible emotional price on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("prefrontal cortex," "neural architectures") in peak beats flattens voice-specific emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's interior life is rendered largely through abstract labels ("velvet disquiet," "resonance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act—placing wax under his tongue and dissolving into prophecy—reads as declared transformation without prior micro-choices that build toward renunciation or cost. Motivations (archiving emotional patterns for forty years) are told but never tested on the page by a concrete dilemma that forces him to choose between competing goods. The piece offers a single continuous state of mystical receptivity rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on abstract language ("furiously tranquil determination," "storm raging in her chest") that tells emotional state rather than embodying it through contradiction or micro-choice. Her motivation—to reopen the atrium and fulfill vortex inheritance—is declared but not tested by competing wants or internal friction; she moves through ritualized actions without visible hesitation or cost. The piece offers vivid perceptual detail (fractal breath, golden pollen vortex) but no moment where she must choose between conflicting goods or pay a legible price that forecloses another path. The final kneeling and smile feel asserted rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is present and her motivation (favoring listening over noise) shapes the central choice, but the characterization relies heavily on telling rather than embodied contradiction. The seventeen-year backstory and "credibly curious nature" are asserted labels without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under immediate pressure. The final decision feels preordained rather than earned through visible internal conflict; no competing impulse acts in scene to create genuine tension. The choice to pull the bell rope carries thematic weight but lacks the friction of a difficult renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's spiritual curiosity is established early, but his interior life relies heavily on abstract contemplation ("he sought the souls of celestial wanderers") rather than embodied contradiction. The final walk into dawn carries weight, yet the transformation from isolation to acceptance feels more asserted through lyric summary than earned through moment-to-moment choice under pressure. Embodied emotion is present in gestures like pressing the glass to his chest, but the piece leans toward poetic statement over lived struggle. The shift from "imprisonment" to "planted" reads as epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivations are established—seven years silent, drawn to preserve unspoken words—but interiority is heavily abstract ("weight that pulled at his ribs like a hooked line," "tangled covenant") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under stress. The final acceptance of his role as repository is told rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict; no competing impulse resists the burden. Embodied emotion is sparse; most sensation is metaphorical or summary ("tranquilly perceptive," "astonished recluse"). The ghost woman's gesture transfers memory, but Elias never wrestles with refusal or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated early ("to understand the texture of time passing") and the final realization arrives on the page, but her agency remains largely observational until the climactic absorption of the urn fragment. Internal contradiction is minimal—her drive to preserve order versus discovering timelessness reads more as serial epiphany than simultaneous warring impulses. The embodied moment of feeling time's texture ("rough linen dragged across wet skin") is vivid, but the decisive shift from borrowed-time keeper to sovereign continuity lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she expands rather than renounces. Micro-choices under pressure are scarce; the encounter with the capsule unfolds as discovery rather than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's interiority is established through her practice of collecting and arranging broken things, with embodied action (wading into water, binding the feather) grounding her philosophy. However, her motivation remains somewhat abstract—"warmly attentive" and "harmonizing discord" function more as thematic labels than as contradictory impulses that create genuine internal friction. The boy is functional but present only to receive her lesson rather than apply meaningful pressure. The final choice to incorporate the feather feels more like demonstration than a decision with visible cost that forecloses other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life remains abstract—we learn his "brazen calm" label but never witness contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cancer consumes with "patient hunger" (poetic but generic), yet no embodied degradation shapes his choices; he works "through declining health" without visible physical or emotional cost altering tactics. The final choice to sit and die is declared rather than earned through prior struggle between competing desires. Motivation stays monolithic: complete the work, with no friction between wanting legacy and wanting comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is abstractly declared ("academically rebellious," "luminous skeptic") but her on-page choices lack concrete cost or internal contradiction. The convergence with three colleagues dilutes individual pressure; no relationship friction tests her stance. Interiority consists largely of metaphorical musing ("preservation itself is a kind of violence") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The final placement of the amber beneath the microscope feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The coachman possesses attributes (speaks dead languages, understands bird calls) but makes no meaningful choices under pressure; he executes a ritual planting with the certainty of inevitability. Interiority is entirely absent—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, no internal conflict. The piece reads as an external portrait of a figure performing predetermined actions rather than a character struggling with stakes. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist is a vessel for the concept, not a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ash's motivation is embodied and consistent throughout—the phonograph cylinder triggers action, the three-day search demonstrates persistence, and the final realization carries genuine weight. Internal contradictions emerge naturally: the hound understands impossibility (no machine exists) yet persists in translation, seeking closeness through ritual. The final choice to sing is earned by the accumulated sensory contact with Mara's preserved traces. Minor slips: "intuitively descriptive" reads more as authorial label than character-specific trait with visible cost, and the emotional arc occasionally tips toward summary ("a hollow space that ached") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's mutation as "specific form of cartography" and her decision to transform exile into methodology show clear motivation and change. Interior experience is heavily filtered through metaphor rather than embodied contradiction—"cells aging microseconds while her consciousness crawled through eons" reads more poetic than character-particular. The final choice feels earned by the mapping work, but micro-choices under pressure remain abstract; we see determination more than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The exchange with the guardian proceeds without internal friction or cost-laden micro-choices; he simply executes a plan we never see him doubt. Interiority relies on stock fantasy register ("sacred playfulness," "cautious abandon") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final "no longer a thief but a keeper of renewed wonder" is an unearned epiphany that replaces character struggle with authorial assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is stated clearly—"benevolently ruthless clarity: she would free the truth"—but her interior contradictions remain largely abstract. The piece tells us she lived "half-false, half-true" without dramatizing competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to read the ledger aloud feels inevitable given her stated goal rather than earned through on-page struggle between self-preservation and exposure. Embodied emotion is present in "her voice that trembled neither with false drama nor with survivor's guilt" but much of the interiority leans on metaphor rather than character-particular sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vey's motivation to escape painful memory is coherent and embodied through the nightly substitution ritual. The mercury-glass physicality provides concrete sensory grounding. However, the climactic shift from "archaeologist" to "architect" of home arrives as a stated epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene—the realization feels delivered rather than earned through visible micro-choices under pressure. The final act of seeding lacks embodied cost; Vey's transformation reads smooth where struggle would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's internal journey from self-loathing to acceptance is traceable, and the final choice to stay and teach feels earned by the mirror revelation. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("winnowing absolution," "sediment clearing") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The productive fidgeting is mentioned but never shown constraining a choice in scene. Motivation is clear but the embodied struggle remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's core motivation—to refract truth into many narratives—drives the opening moves, but the final shift to "surrender" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivot from guarding purity to embracing reinterpretation arrives via meta-commentary ("understood then") instead of a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost. Lira's trait ("innocently mischievous") is label-only; her actions (releasing echoes, adding nonsense rhymes) advance plot but lack embodied contradiction or internal cost that would deepen her role. Interior language occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the willingness to let their truth be changed") without anchoring in concrete perception or gesture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority shows through embodied action—pressing fingertips to craters, working the charm—and the piece tracks her shift from uncertainty to conviction through deliberate ritual. However, motivation occasionally drifts into over-articulated self-awareness ("uncertain alchemist," "absolute belief") that reads more like external labeling than crisis-bound thought. The final stance crystallization is earned through the memory-filling sequence, though the leap from doubt to "uncertain no longer" could use more gradation. Internal contradiction appears but tends toward alternating summary rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's grief and artistic paralysis are embodied through concrete images (cracked mirror, stiff brushes), and the decision to enter the cave and finally paint shows agency under pressure. However, the resolution—"his own capacity to begin again"—edges toward label-speak at the closure beat, and the internal arc relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final choice to paint feels more like acceptance than a trade-off with visible cost, missing the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation (proving whispers travel farther than shouts) shapes his final action. The metaphysical mechanics—jasmine cork purifying intentions—strain plausibility and blur motivation at the closure beat: does he save the ship through scent-vapors or symbolic gesture? Internal contradiction remains underexplored; his five years of submission pivot too cleanly into decisive action without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The weeping finale edges toward performed emotion rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-specific ("prosthetic leg drumming...in an arrhythmia that matched her heart"), with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (walking backward through evacuation columns, anchored by gravity that isn't physical). However, much of the character work operates in reflective summary rather than on-page choice under pressure; the cognitive fluctuation attribute is told more than dramatized in a way that forecloses options. The final choice to activate the apparatus feels more like completion of an externally directed task than an internal struggle with visible cost. Mid-band entry appropriate given strong voice and texture, but the lack of a truly earned interior reversal caps higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her involuntary truthfulness generates genuine constraint in the ritual scene ("I am afraid," she shouted into the storm, and the words hung heavier than the rain because she could not soften them with lies). The interiority carries specific embodied details (fingers striking glass, tracing faded ink with trembling fingers). However, the ending choice feels more described than earned—her smile and descent arrive as summary rather than a lived decision with visible friction, and the empathy virus trait functions more as backstory explanation than an on-page struggle that shapes her final action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and consistent—her physical reaction to the boutonnière ("displacement of self that knocked the breath from her lungs") anchors the borrowed-memory device in embodied experience. The progression from solitude to communion through inherited duty creates a credible arc, and the final choice to pin the flower to her coat feels earned by the layered revelation. Minor deduction: the stranger's motivations arrive primarily through told memory rather than dramatized friction, and Maren's decision carries minimal visible cost or foreclosed alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arthur's interiority is filtered through his authenticator's eye and establishes clear motivation (finding Thomas's promised site), but key emotional beats lean toward summary ("loneliness that had calcified into routine") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to become "curator of roads not taken" arrives without visible internal conflict or competing impulse; we see decision, not struggle. The brother relationship functions as setup rather than on-page crucible, and Arthur's decades of expertise don't visibly constrain or complicate his choices in the cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trajectory from disbelieving queen to "seamstress of the torn heavens" shows arc structure, but her choices feel narrated rather than dramatized—she "softly commands" the mountain and later the pool without visible internal conflict or cost in those moments. Mara's sudden presence introduces a relationship dimension, yet their shared history ("childhood they had shared before crowns intervened") arrives via summary rather than shaping an on-page choice. The abdication is declared but not enacted through a concrete forfeiture that closes a door; the final gesture of trailing fingers through liquid light reads more as symbolic completion than a decision with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("scientifically romantic instrumentation strapped to her wrists trembled with anticipation") rather than embodied emotion particular to this character. The moment when Mira reveals she kept the first bottled sun should force a choice or alter Elara's stance, but instead triggers only seamless alchemical procedure without visible internal conflict. The closure presents successful transmutation as fait accompli without earned struggle or visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is textured and specific—jealousy of past selves as navigation, the birch bark scroll as anchor—but key moments slip into abstraction ("jaded wonder," "feral nostalgia") that label states rather than embody them. The floating-as-jealousy sequence reads more as conceptual metaphor than embodied choice under pressure, and the final decision to "chronicle with detachment" lacks visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority is consistent and voice-particular, but the protagonist's agency at closure remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior world is richly textured through her lost sense of smell and her compensatory attention to visual detail. The character work is strongest in her sensory deprivation and adaptation, but the arc from aromatherapist to clock repairer feels more contemplated than tested by pressure. The screw discovery prompts reflection rather than a choice that alters her stance with visible cost. Interiority occasionally leans toward label-speak ("emotional terrain," "humanize") without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and sustained, with embodied stress (burning lungs, trembling fingers) grounding her state. The crystallizing scars provide concrete physical stakes. However, the internal contradiction feels manufactured rather than genuinely conflicted—she moves from academic skepticism to childhood superstition without meaningful resistance or cost to that shift. The final tea ceremony gesture reads as an add-on rather than an earned integration of her scholarly and personal identities.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivations are clear and embodied through concrete actions (setting up the theremin, opening the perfume bottle), with her professional gossip-column expertise tangibly informing her approach to the supernatural. Internal conflict registers in the abandonment of metaphor ("I am sorry") after a career of indirection, and the final cost—column left unwritten, pen dry—forecloses a path. Minor slip: the composer's emotional arc feels more asserted than earned through prior beats, relying on static description ("eyes that held the weight") rather than dramatized contradiction. The choice to kneel and speak plainly is earned, but the spirit's forgiveness reads as given rather than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is positioned as an archetypal witness-archivist rather than a character with interior contradictions and embodied emotional stakes. Motivation is asserted through cosmic-scale abstractions ("to unravel cosmic illusions") without grounding in lived conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Agency at closure—writing "one wanderingly exact word"—reads as symbolic enactment without visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece privileges concept over character particularity, resulting in a narrator who observes and performs rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shepherd's philosophical quest is embodied through concrete action (counting, gripping the key, walking the perimeter) and his motivation is sustained throughout. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—the insight arrives smoothly rather than through genuine internal conflict. The final renunciation (leaving the key) feels somewhat declarative rather than earned through prior struggle with visible cost. Embodiment is present but the character's arc reads more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interior texture is established through her profession and father's legacy, but her choices on the page remain observational rather than decisive. The heart attack provides embodied constraint ("fingers trembled," "cautious tempo"), yet the evening's action is fundamentally passive—she follows scrawls, arrives at the library, calculates a probability without dramatized cost. The final choice to "teach differently" is asserted rather than enacted through a micro-decision that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction exists (father's desperation vs. her discipline) but does not drive a visible tradeoff in this single evening.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is singular and consistent—teaching estrangement through cultivated endings—but her interior remains abstract and observational rather than embodied under pressure. The accountant, conductor, teenager, and elderly man function as interchangeable wrong-number props; none challenge Mara's stance or force a contradiction in her philosophy. Her deliberate disconnections lack visible cost on the page; she never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices something she wants, reducing her agency to a performance of a static thesis. Emotion is claimed ("melodically haunted," "glass harmonica tones") but not felt through contradictory impulses or embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is dense and character-particular ("haunted euphoria," the physics of grief-as-sedimentation), and her occupation constrains her methods on the page. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective exposition rather than micro-choices under pressure; her actions—walking carefully, writing, touching the locket—are ritualistic but not genuinely conflicted. The final turn ("the covenant had been regenerated...by her documentation") reads as assertion rather than a visible forfeiture or stance crystallization that forecloses a live path. Embodied emotion is present but the cost of her decision remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is given clear motivation (curing loneliness) and his logistician role shapes the reciprocity system, but his arc lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The child's arrival triggers recognition, yet Elias's internal shift feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that expose competing impulses. The "desperately jocular" trait appears as voice decoration without constraining a key decision. Agency at closure reads more as realization than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to map her own emotional depths is clear and drives the journey, but her interior life relies heavily on metaphor and abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final self-mapping feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (trembling fingers, warm ring) but peaks often default to label-like interiority ("geometries of grief"). The character reads as functional but the internal conflict lacks the messy simultaneity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to correct her error is clear and her agency drives the editing action at closure. However, interiority leans toward diagnostic abstraction ("confidently uncertain," "thresh meaning from experience") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ghost-image colleagues and the pen's crumbling sacrifice feel more symbolic convenience than lived choice. Micro-choices exist but are often narrated through elevated metaphor rather than moment-by-moment embodied decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and the final choice to perform in sign language is earned by his deafness and prior mapping. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"joyful sorrow bloom in his chest" reads label-like at a peak beat. Mara remains functional but underdeveloped; her whispered encouragement and signing provide necessary pressure, yet she never makes an independent choice that alters tactics. The camera-as-viewfinder conceit is specific and constrains his method, lifting the score into the upper 6s despite the abstract emotional phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The backstory-heavy opening delivers years of arson and archaeological expertise through summary, while her present actions in the archive—tracing gouges, setting up an easel—lack embodied resistance or cost. The shift from destroyer to bridge-builder is asserted ("she understood now") rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interior voice relies on elevated abstractions ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive precision") that feel authorial rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through repeated drumming action; his desire to resurrect Elena drives concrete choices (climbing the tower, matching his heartbeat to the pulse). Internal contradiction appears when he simultaneously knows she's "not Elena, not exactly" yet whispers "Stay"—a genuine tension between acceptance and denial. The characterization suffers slightly from over-articulated interiority ("quantum foam of their joined recollection") that edges toward label-speak, and the doctors' misreading of his behavior as "merely stimming" feels like convenient obtuseness rather than earned dramatic irony.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael is rendered through distinctive choices—listening to footsteps, teaching patterns, managing the whisper network—with embodied perception (grease-stained finger, deliberate map folding). The final transfer of coin and instruction to the young worker earns a small renunciation/teaching moment with cost (giving up the tool, foreclosing direct action). Internal contradiction is minimal; Kael's competence never truly stumbles under pressure, reducing felt struggle. Voss and the young worker remain functional but secondary, applying pressure without deep interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    The guardian remains completely static—no internal contradiction, no micro-choices under pressure, no embodied emotion beyond label-only "spiralingly calm depths." The character performs gestures in service of an abstract lesson but never faces a dilemma, makes a trade-off, or reveals conflicting impulses. Motivation is declared ("to teach darkness the value of stars") but never tested or complicated on the page. The final act (lowering the mirror) carries no visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's attribute (hearing unspoken words) is established early, but his interiority remains abstract—we receive poetic summaries of what he hears rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice (placing the queen, descending) feels more ritual than renunciation with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page. The motivation ("to plant forests of second thoughts") is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is conveyed through elevated metaphor rather than specific physical states under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's embodied interiority is strong ("ache in her guarded heart," scrimshaw's warmth), and her decision to step off the dock carries visible cost. However, the transformation moment relies heavily on metaphoric assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Old Mako's brief appearance and the gathered workers provide witness but minimal relational crucible. The "fortress she had constructed" frame is told more than shown through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is consistently rendered through his theatrical narration and the contradictory impulses of his past (hoarding sorrows while enforcing joy). His blank face paired with operatic speech creates a specific embodied contradiction. The woman's micro-choice to accept the unfinished bird and exhale without measuring carries visible cost—she risks sensation after numbness. Minor: Elias's interiority could show more stress under the woman's arrival; his performance reads practiced rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her "tremor of certainty" operates as mystical mechanism rather than earned psychological state; no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The seven-year wait and final transformation are asserted rather than dramatized through embodied cost. Interior voice relies on abstract constructions ("aesthetically driven," "metamorphic language") that read as prompt-label placement rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's colorblindness is embodied through her perception of "degrees of silver and pewter" and "texture rather than hue," and her search for a cure drives the barter. The final realization—that she sought the wrong awakening—feels somewhat declared rather than fully earned through prior contradictory impulses in scene. Marin's six-month silence and botanical grammar are specific, but the glassblower's internal conflict remains mostly told. The ending choice to paint "the sound itself" shifts stance but lacks visible cost on the page that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivations are signaled (prism-song training, distrust of the sanitized itinerary) but her internal contradictions remain shallow; she moves from doubt to action without the messy ambivalence that would make the turn costly. The "powerfully gentle" attribute is label-heavy and repeated without embodied demonstration—her gestures at the crystal feel decorative rather than revealing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to stay and strike again reads as thematic fulfillment rather than a foreclosure with visible personal cost; we don't see what path she abandons or what competing desire she sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is present but operates largely in retrospective exposition rather than live contradiction under pressure. The young man's transformation reads as passive reception rather than earned agency—he observes, understands, and departs without a visible internal conflict forcing a costly choice. Motivation is declared ("to teach withering to bloom again") but never tested by a competing want or fear that would make her action costly in the moment. Embodied emotion is thin; grief is labeled and discussed rather than enacted through contradictory impulses during the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is mostly clear, but relies heavily on abstract reflection about patterns and systems rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her "steadily curious" trait remains label-only; we never see a moment where curiosity costs her or creates friction with another want. Elias's arrival offers a brief relationship crucible, but his hollow-eyed passivity doesn't generate status pressure or force Mara into a difficult choice. The ending crystallizes her methodology but doesn't foreclose a path or show visible cost—she simply continues mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's motivation (anguished joy at forbidden knowledge) is embodied through erratic movement and sensory detail ("trembled not with fear but with the particular anguished joy"). Internal contradiction appears in "weeping and laughing in the same breath" at closure. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract constructions ("atoms of nostalgia," "end of innocence") that read more conceptual than character-particular, and the peak emotional beat uses diagnostic phrasing ("anguished joy") repeatedly rather than fresh embodiment. The final choice to "teach the living" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" is declared but her interior contradictions remain abstract; we see her observing and deducing but no embodied conflict between impulses. The final choice to "edit the footage" feels more like problem-solving than a decision that costs her something personal or forecloses a path. Interiority relies on elevated phrasing ("softly deliberate," "sharp-eyed dusk noticer") that reads as externally applied rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The shadow's transformation is dramatized, but Elara's stake in it—what she risks or loses by intervening—never materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior struggle is embodied through handling the chameleon, but the arc relies heavily on reflective summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under present pressure. The past three days of interrogation are told, not shown; the key decision to testify and continue the work arrives as declaration rather than emerging from on-page conflict. Emotional states are sometimes labeled ("fractured integrity demanding attention") rather than consistently embodied through specific perception shifts. The renunciation of Marcus's pendant is a concrete gesture, but the surrounding material leans on therapeutic language ("self-deception," "complicity") that flattens interiority at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior is specific and embodied at several moments (touching the dressing, tracing coffee rings on his palm), and his drive to find his sister creates coherent motivation through the descent. However, the shift from surgical recovery to tunneling underground lacks embodied cost—he moves from "every nerve screaming" to extended action without fatigue or hesitation. The sister's telepathy and the plants' guidance blur agency; key choices feel received rather than wrestled from competing impulses, and the final touch lacks visible internal contradiction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to find where unused love is stored") but not dramatized through conflicting choices or trade-offs. Her psychometry journey involves observation and reception rather than agency-driven decisions that foreclose paths. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophical language ("climate-controlled vault," "geometry of redemption") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final departure carries no visible cost or renunciation—she simply walks away with knowledge, planning to return.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (freeing trapped creativity) is clear and drives the journey, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The block as "cage" and "stardust in veins" read as poetic labels rather than lived experience with micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation—clay under nails, marble dust in hair—arrives as declared outcome rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is dense and poetic but largely static—his dreamlessness and duty are asserted repeatedly without contradiction or micro-choices that test competing impulses. The final placement of the clock reads as fulfillment rather than a choice with visible internal cost; he arrives at peace rather than forecloses a live path. Embodied emotion is scarce; the prose favors metaphor over bodily particulars under pressure. Motivation is told through abstractions ("cultivate the sparks") rather than dramatized friction between want and fear.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is established early and his internal state—the sixth sense overwhelming his perception—creates pressure throughout. The encounter with the stranger forces a realization that shifts his stance from retreat to engagement. However, the insight that "the sixth sense doesn't overwhelm, it amplifies what we refuse to untangle" arrives as an articulated epiphany rather than through embodied contradiction or micro-choices under stress. The final beats show acceptance rather than visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is embodied through concrete sensory anchors (trembling fingers, star stamp bite, Atlas's weight), and her micro-choices under pressure (pausing at the grotto entrance, choosing not to reach for the leash) reveal character progression. However, the final realization leans heavily on abstract articulation ("the woman she had been before anxiety had caged her") rather than letting the concrete action carry all the weight. The epiphany about the leash's true function arrives somewhat explained rather than purely dramatized, though the star-stamp covenant and the physical act of carrying Atlas home without restraint partially ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bellhop's interiority is concrete and his motivation (understanding the cost of safety) shapes his investigation, yet the climactic decision—choosing silence as "a gift of patience"—arrives through abstract philosophizing rather than dramatized pressure. The nerve regeneration creates embodied stakes, but the final stance crystallizes through reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal conflict is present but the resolution feels told rather than earned through on-page friction with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    The titan is characterized entirely through label and description ("regally unpretentious," "diminutive," "graceful") without micro-choices under pressure that reveal contradictory impulses. The pretender's unmasking proceeds without internal friction or embodied emotion—his face "sloughs away" and he "screams" but we see no fear-driven micro-decision, no attempt to bargain or flee that would make him dimensional. The titan's final gesture and "sundering word" are plot mechanisms rather than character-revealing actions shaped by cost or ambivalence. Interiority is absent; the prose asserts dignity and terror without anchoring either in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and her practice of tapping—an embodied habit that modulates with pressure—grounds her consistently. Her singular motivation (discovering why paths disappear) drives her assembly of data cores and final choice to transmit the atlas page. The revelation that "paths disappeared not when the coral died, but when the last navigator who remembered the living reef retired" is earned by her on-page cross-referencing and carries visible cost (releasing the witness artifact). Minimal direct internal conflict; her stance deepens rather than contradicts itself, which limits the band ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her physical grounding (barefoot, tactile awareness) is embodied throughout. The characterization suffers from over-articulated mystical insight ("stubborn refusal of patterns to break completely") that reads as thematic shorthand rather than earned realization. Her motivation to "reignite the connection" remains abstract; the final choice lacks visible cost—she performs the ritual successfully without forfeiting a live option or confronting a genuine dilemma. The "awkwardly confident" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her telepathic trait creates embodied contradiction ("tasted like lightning and chlorophyll"), but her agency at the climax feels preordained rather than chosen under pressure. The plants direct her through most key beats, reducing her stakes to executing their will. Internal conflict is present in the tradition-versus-evolution tension, but the resolution lacks visible cost—she smiles and feels gratitude, no path foreclosed. The final choice reads inevitable rather than renunciatory or transformative with on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior contradiction is well embodied through somatic markers—trembling fingers, shallow breath, freeze response—that constrain his actions and reveal trauma processing. The photograph functions as a concrete object that triggers physiological cascades, and his final smile at the image demonstrates earned change through gradual layering. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic language ("somatic marker," "topography of survival") that reads slightly diagnostic, though the embodied details anchor it. The movement from freeze to deliberate motion shows genuine cost and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior feels specific—charcoal-stained hands, accusatory eyes in her portraits—but her decisions unfold too smoothly without genuine contradiction. The emotional progression from crestfallen to cartographer reads as conceptual satisfaction rather than embodied struggle. No visceral mistake compounds the pressure; the untangling succeeds without meaningful friction or blind spots that would ground her agency. The final transformation lacks a visible, felt price that forecloses an earlier path.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tracker's "serene anger" and seventeen-year quest are declared rather than embodied through contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. His dissolution into "the moment itself" reads as concept rather than earned character arc—no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page, only metaphysical assertion. The drone and ink function as props for exposition rather than forcing a genuine dilemma. Interiority remains abstract ("consciously wild," "perfect focus") without the messy contradictions or embodied emotion required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear and her internal conflict is established (oath vs. revelation), but the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("bravely conflicted," "moral crisis") rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to upload occurs "within the blink that follows surprise" but the seventeen-year buildup compresses into a single choice without dramatized internal friction or visible tradeoffs in the moment. The final stance (peaceful waiting) feels earned by her archival role but lacks micro-choices under pressure that would reveal a hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is sustained and character-particular—her perceptual signature (fractured light at 6:47, sandbag tones) grounds her withdrawal from violence in concrete sensory detail. Internal contradiction is present (father's legacy vs. pacifist stance) but mostly told rather than dramatized in simultaneous conflict. The ceremonial blade ritual offers one micro-choice that forecloses violence with visible cost, but the renunciation feels predetermined rather than tested under live pressure. Embodied emotion is solid; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's goal is clear and his sensory world is richly embodied—fear transliterates into topography on the spike, joy into shivers. However, his choices feel pre-determined rather than fraught; he moves through the garden methodically without meaningful on-page trade-offs or internal contradiction. The final moment where he catches the echo reads as fulfillment of a seven-year plan rather than a decision under pressure that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's interiority is concrete and her motivation to verify the fraud is clear, but her emotional arc feels too smooth—the decision to publish and destroy her inheritance arrives without sustained internal contradiction. The moment of "solemn playfulness" conducting "an autopsy on her own inheritance" gestures toward ambivalence but doesn't dramatize competing impulses in action. Micro-choices are present (beginning calculations, composing the correction) but lack visible cost until the very end, where the forfeiture is declared rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (guilt-driven time travel to save her daughter) is established and pursued. However, the resolution feels too assured: "the dissonance of old guilt finally resolving into a harmony" and the younger self turning back lack on-page friction or contradiction. The interiority remains at high metaphoric altitude throughout ("dissonant chord that had screamed beneath her ribs") without sufficient embodied specificity under pressure. The final choice—touching her own shoulder and transmitting understanding—bypasses genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her craft shapes the resolution, but her interior texture relies on stock poetic descriptions rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shift from whimsy to serious purpose is told, not dramatized through micro-choices. "Socially perceptive enough to recognize that the grotto itself had been lonely" performs self-aware diagnostic label-speak at the climax, flattening what should be an embodied discovery. The mandala work is goal-driven, but the final realization arrives as summary rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is established but tends toward stated values rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive trap provides strong perceptual specificity and the augmented limbs create physical contradiction, yet the renaming decision feels more philosophical than pressured by competing impulses. Micro-choices (kneeling, tracing cracks, placing the tessera) demonstrate care but the final stance arrives without visible internal friction or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian's motivation—to "lure possibility from the brink"—drives his action through song and the coin transfer, showing contradiction between his encore-seeking and other-focused sacrifice. Mara's despair is embodied through the box cutter and curled posture, but her transformation reads too swift; the instant she touches the coin and "saw not her ending but her beginning" lacks the micro-choices that would earn the shift. The synesthetic trait remains label-only decoration rather than a constraint that shapes Julian's tactics under pressure. Internal voice is consistent but the final choice feels granted rather than forged through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's affectionate skepticism is established through her gestures ("holding the trembling hands") and her whispered contradiction ("I don't believe in telepathy...but I believe in your pain"), but her interior landscape remains largely abstract. The emotional turn at closure—"skepticism transformed into a fierce, protective love"—is asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Her brother's voice "transmitted through those pills" is a backstory tell that could prime present conflict but instead functions as explanation. The protagonist's embodied reactions (stomach clenching, breath catching) serve the method more than revealing character-specific vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation "to become the voice of the unknown" is stated but never tested through competing desires or genuine friction. The fossil warming in their palm and synchronizing with their heartbeat reads as mystical assertion rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("consuming motivation," "understanding immediately") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The ending gesture—holding the fossil, recording with "trembling hands"—offers physical detail but no visible cost or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is present but her interiority reads as abstract label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The prophetic crisis never forces a genuine internal conflict—she moves smoothly from fear to action without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her final transformation ("no longer merely a keeper of time, but a seamstress of what might yet be") is declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal cost. The therapeutic self-awareness ("quietly inspired by the knowledge") flattens what should be a moment of lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority shows contradiction—guilt over three dead agents versus desire for repair—and the pillbox anchors her emotion concretely. However, "prudently daring" is told via label rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure, and the final surrender feels more stated ("mended soul") than earned through visible internal cost. Marcus appears as functional opposition but lacks distinct voice or stance that evolves on the page. The motivational arc is present but remains at tell-level in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's interiority is concrete and meditative, with embodied emotion (temperature on wrists, coolness on cheek). His motivation—distilling complexity into essence—is consistently shown through the needle work and ambient awareness. However, the character's agency remains largely observational until the final boarding; no on-page contradictory impulses act simultaneously, and the promise-layering feels more thematic than a lived conflict that forces a costly choice. The ending move is poised but not decisively transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kai's interiority is strongly filtered through lyric philosophical register ("sharp gentleness," "phototropic to kindness"), creating a consistent perceptual signature. However, the journey feels more like enacted meditation than genuine internal contradiction under pressure; she arrives already knowing how to "breathe, cultivating the sharp gentleness" and her final choice to leave the glass is acceptance rather than a conflicted trade-off. Embodied emotion is present but abstract ("question that had settled in her chest"), and no genuine struggle between competing impulses appears on the page. The piece honors contemplative interiority but lacks the contradictory desires or costly micro-choices that would push into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are established through clear backstory linkage (father's lighthouse work, mother's gardening), and her final choice to restore the lighthouse is earned through accumulated grief transformed into guardianship. However, interiority leans toward therapeutic self-awareness ("protected vulnerability of having finally used the tools she had hoarded, having transformed private grief into public guardianship") that feels too articulate for a peak beat. Embodied emotion is present (knees pressed against grating, calloused hands) but competes with abstract reflection. The renunciation of her garden sanctuary and the physical journey represent genuine cost, though the final realization borders on over-articulated wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her realization ("not a shattering, but a delicate frost") reads as an unearned epiphany—no prior causality forces this shift. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("brittle awakening crystallize within her") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final smile at her reflection feels like emotional summary rather than a lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's seventeen-year withdrawal is established, but her motivations remain abstract—"the syntax of desire" and "spiral chambers of her chest" sound composed rather than felt. The turn toward public art arises from recognition of the nest's architecture, yet the choice lacks visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The reconciliation with Mara feels unearned; we learn "I never knew" without prior dramatization of what was at stake between them or what specific cost Elara's silence exacted.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's competence is well-established through her three years of prior work, and her trembling hands during the sequence show embodied fear. However, her motivation remains largely declarative—we're told she understood their game but never see the on-page moment of realization that changes her stance. The cosmic tricksters' withdrawal feels convenient rather than earned through her prior choices, and the final "cautiously hopeful" framing lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's claustrophobia is embodied through concrete physical sensations ("lungs already tightened," "walls pressing against her shoulders") and drives the stakes consistently. Her prudent waiting versus charging forward demonstrates active internal contradiction under pressure. The decades of mapping horizons versus descending into depths creates character-specific tension, though the final choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than foreclosing a genuinely live alternative path. Her terror versus determination warring at the climax is dramatized rather than merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's prosopagnosia and methodical nature are established, but her internal contradiction remains largely told rather than dramatized in scene pressure. The "cold case had frozen her heart" and subsequent thawing are asserted through summary rather than shown through specific choices under stress. The final realization that she "felt the weight of the face...as living, breathing anguish" arrives as a label rather than an embodied shift with visible cost. Her investigative choices proceed linearly without meaningful internal friction or trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear and consistent—vindicating her ancestor drives all major choices. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("nervously confident," "dizzying clarity") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The lead meteorologist's sudden comprehension at the end feels convenient rather than earned through prior friction. Internal conflict is mostly narrated rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal state is embodied through concrete physical cues (fiddle humming against collarbone, fingers bleeding) and his motivation to play again after trauma is dramatized through action rather than summary. However, interiority sometimes drifts into abstract diagnostic language ("luminous disbelief flooded Elias's chest") that labels emotion rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to play feels earned by the glass-flake revelation, but the hitchhiker's function as external catalyst rather than relational pressure limits the sense of genuine internal conflict driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is established—understanding cyclical patterns versus escaping them—and the final acceptance earns a stance shift. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The pivotal "perceptively calm" realization reads more as diagnostic summary than lived tension. Minor: "polished calm...perceptively calm" blurs into label-speak at the closure rather than showing contradictory impulses colliding.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (decode temple inscriptions, finish her brother's work), but interior contradiction never manifests in scene—she moves smoothly from observation to epiphany without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The brother's death and her grief are told rather than embodied; we get summary ("seventeen years recording nightmares") without a single micro-choice under pressure that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final realization arrives as cognitive summary rather than enacted cost: she writes, she places the telegram in the archive, she descends—actions that feel like checklist completion rather than renunciation or painful acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled clearly (discover what mirrors don't show), but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout. The "guarded druid" trait and "warlike serenity" are stated repeatedly without embodied contradictions or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final release of the seed reads as a mechanical solution rather than a choice driven by internal conflict with visible cost. Emotional progression is flat; she moves through extreme events without degradation or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (rewrite the broken timeline) and her root-bound state provides physical constraint. However, interiority remains abstract—"anxious elation," "purposefully curious"—rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to enter the intersection feels inevitable rather than earned through competing impulses; her release from the roots lacks visible cost beyond "wet, tearing sounds." Kael's presence adds relational pressure but his agency is largely supportive rather than conflicting.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's reckless idealism is embodied through concrete choices—burning the card, entering the orchard, offering his years—each action intensifying his contradiction between grief-driven agency and magical thinking. His interior voice is specific ("the mathematics of a heart that refused to accept subtraction") and the final renunciation feels earned when he accepts that "some destinies could not be traded, only shared." Minor slip: the shift from bargaining to acceptance arrives quickly in the final paragraph, compressing what could have been a more gradual realization. The embodied emotion (pressing forehead to bark, feeling roots bind) anchors the peak moment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's interiority is specific and contradictory—he "confidently uncertain," emotionally insulating with facts while chest aching with recognition. The final choice (authenticating the cloth) emerges from internal conflict between precision and mercy, showing competing impulses in action. Backstory threads through present stimuli effectively, anchoring in the cloth and photograph. Minor deduction: some emotional states lean toward articulated insight ("understanding finally that his purpose") rather than purely embodied pressure, though the cost of choosing mercy over precision remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his methodical nature shapes his approach, but his interiority relies heavily on elevated exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The transition to dissolution feels more like philosophical assertion than earned character choice—his "quiet dedication" and "touching distance" are told labels rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance lacks visible struggle or cost that would ground his transformation in concrete character work.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    The librarian's motivation is declared ("to preserve wonder in routine") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority remains abstract—"communicated through the grinding of gears, a sound like glaciers calving"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. The identities' resistance and surrender are told rather than enacted through on-page tension. The librarian's arc lacks visible cost; the task proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "dissolve walls between hearts" arrives as a label-heavy epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. The trembling hands observation and childhood weight feel like therapeutic self-diagnosis inserted mid-scene. Her final choice to delete records and crown the stalagmite carries visible cost (professional breach, physical risk), but the turn from inspector to "keeper of postponed radiance" reads as declared transformation rather than earned through sustained internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority is vivid and character-particular: the decision to stop lithium, the embodied return of sensory textures, and the accordion moment all show contradictory impulses (grief vs. relief, methodology vs. emotion). The sister's death and Maya's guilt drive choices with visible cost. However, some therapeutic framings ("dangerous clarity of unsilenced thoughts," "anesthesia of prescriptions") veer toward diagnostic label-speak rather than purely embodied experience, though they remain largely integrated into her professional lens as a chronicler.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains largely passive, moving through the library without genuine internal conflict or embodied emotion. Her motivation is declared ("sole motivation since childhood") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance of the second letter feels unearned—no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from her documentation work. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("cautious exuberance," "unspoken lexicon") rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's professional devotion to unvarnished history drives her final choice with visible cost (career, safety, funding). Her plant-telepathy and coffee-stain divination are introduced early but read more as ornamental abilities than traits that shape choices under pressure—the jasmine provides atmospheric advice rather than forcing a hard trade-off. Internal conflict is present (dream vs. empire, beauty vs. safety) but the final decision feels preordained by her established values rather than contradictory impulses wrestling in scene. The "mulberry ache of the choice" is asserted more than embodied through micro-hesitations or physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly ("to capture one last spark before oblivion") but her internal contradiction is thin—she operates with calm competence throughout, never wavering or doubting her ritual. The dancer remains inert; no second character appears to test Elara's stance. Her final act of archiving the chip reads as routine execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, leaving characterization functional but one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established—seeking contentment after forgiving his daughter—and his final choice to plant the hairpin is dramatized with visible cost (surrendering the last physical remnant). However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("contentment was not a destination to be reached but a surrender to the endless returning") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The character's arc from preservation to participation is legible, but the emotional progression feels more conceptual than visceral, with minimal friction between competing impulses in the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's profession and stance are established early, but his motivations remain abstract—his need to "welcome nuance into certainty" is declared rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The cartographer's visit is summarized rather than enacted, leaving the protagonist's key choice (unhooking the cloak) somewhat disconnected from live pressure. Internal contradiction appears more as authorial assertion ("sincerely insincere") than as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final decision to offer "ambiguity" instead of "absolution" reads more as thematic position than earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The backwards-aging researcher has a conceptually rich internal landscape, but his motivation and choices remain abstract throughout. The piece offers extensive reflection on his condition and purpose, yet no moment forces a genuine micro-choice under pressure—he observes, understands, accepts. Embodied emotion is scarce; the prose defaults to elevated philosophical register rather than visceral contradiction. The "delayed revelation" about his purpose arrives as insight, not as a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The skimmer's motivation—learning to navigate without moving—is sustained throughout, and the final transformation into landmark tracks with the stated goal. However, interiority remains abstract and label-heavy: "weathered resolve hardening," "pulse left wandering," and "historically reverent care" are asserted rather than embodied through specific sensory contradiction or micro-choice. The protagonist's agency is largely contemplative observation rather than pressure-tested decision; the arrowhead insight arrives as realization, not struggle. Embodied emotion and internal conflict are minimally present; the piece tells us about states rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his final choice—unstrapping and embracing the keystone—forecloses his path within the automated system with felt cost. Internal conflict is present (efficiency metrics vs. sacred simplicity) but unfolds mostly through reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The phrase "beauty instead of production" and similar abstractions edge toward label-speak; embodiment is stronger in the mist-walking sequence. Secondary characters are absent, so relationship/status bullets don't apply.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated and his choice to descend is clear, but internal contradiction is minimal—he drifts "with methodical aimlessness" yet the narrative never shows genuine ambivalence or competing impulses acting simultaneously. His grandmother's deathbed instructions anchor backstory within ~20%, but the final realization feels more like receiving a gift than foreclosing a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (key tag "warm in his palm") but the climactic moment leans toward wonder rather than a choice that alters stance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clearly rooted in her role as decision maker, and her micro-choices (adjusting the receiver, scattering coins) are concrete. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract cosmic concepts rather than embodied contradiction—"stellar doubt gnawing at her calculations" labels rather than dramatizes internal conflict. The "quietly enthusiastic" attribute appears as assertion without visible behavioral cost or tradeoff that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper's motivation—naming nameless fears—is established early and drives the ritual, but interior experience leans heavily on abstract conceptual statements ("the namelessness of his mourning") rather than embodied contradiction. The crystallization act forecloses his passivity with visible cost (accepting permanent distance), yet the emotional progression lacks credible irrationality; grief resolves too tidily into "precision of one who had finally learned." Micro-choices during the ritual (positioning the atlas, naming each creature) advance pressure, but the reaper remains more vessel than agent with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is coherent and her "lukewarm" abilities constrain her approach—she must "coax" rather than force. However, interiority leans toward abstract labels ("brittle devotion," "earnest desperation") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to persist in counting dripping rates is consistent but feels more like endurance than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and specific—his trembling fingers and three decades of checking dam integrity create credible history. However, his final motivation ("to spin stories into shared meaning") arrives through direct statement rather than through contradictory impulses tested under pressure. The nurse Sarah Chen and the grandmother's ambulance arrive as backstory exposition without forcing a present choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. His decision to build an archive feels inevitable but lacks the embodied tension of competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's scholarly-to-intuitive arc is established early and paid off at closure, but her interior reads as expository rather than embodied. The wooden horse provides a sentimental anchor, yet the transformation feels asserted through metaphor ("the scholar and the dreamer") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices are absent; she moves through the orchard without visible hesitation or cost until the final paragraphs declare integration complete. The final-paragraph articulation "intuition was simply logic wearing the mask of poetry" edges into thematic echo, undermining the earned quality of her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is consistently embodied through the parachute buckle, micro-fracture detection, and muscle memory, grounding her expertise in physical sensation rather than abstract competence. Her fear manifests through breath-holding and twitching fingers, not therapy-speak. The trust/burden dynamic drives micro-choices (adjusting the clip angle, positioning at the edge) that alter tactics under pressure. Minor slip: Kael's interior state remains opaque on arrival; his whispered line feels slightly generic against the specificity of Elara's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's ego-death state is evocatively described, but her internal contradiction reads more as told oscillation between philosophical positions than simultaneous competing impulses acting *in* scene. The final weeping offers embodied emotion, but the path to it relies heavily on abstract psychological claims ("empty corridors," "ego-death perspective") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The custody battle with the brain is conceptually rich but Maya's agency manifests primarily through acceptance and philosophical synthesis rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's phantom state is established with vivid particulars (the pull cord handle, leaf blower conductor history), but his motivation to restore laughter operates largely through metaphorical action rather than micro-choices under pressure. The interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion—"mournfully eager," "desperate to restore"—rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. His wife and daughter appear only as observed presences; no relationship friction or status dynamic tests his choices on the page. The backstory (leaf blower symphony) is colorful but does not tilt a present decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fox-headed librarian is particularized through hybrid physicality ("paws, more human than beast") and the interiorizing technique, but her journey from refugee to native-of-in-between unfolds mostly through summary reflection rather than on-page micro-choices under pressure. The "dimensionally homesick" attribute remains largely a label; we're told she fled seeking something and now accepts ambiguity, but no beat dramatizes a trade-off between the pendant's pull and her present attachment. The final curl around the oak root reads as achieved stasis without visible cost—she has "made friends with uncertainty" by declaration rather than through a sequence of difficult renunciations that foreclose options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his interior state is tracked through embodied detail (touching fractured wood, reading smoke). However, the interiority frequently slips into elevated abstractions ("clarity of a man who had nothing left to lose," "courage to unmake completely") that feel imposed rather than earned through Marcus's particular idiom. The final transformation feels more told than dramatized—we're assured he feels "dangerous, exhilarating weight of future possibility" without witnessing the micro-choices that would ground that shift. Agency at closure exists but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's professional methodical precision is established early, but her interior life reads largely as exposition about her craft rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic choice to place the fragment on the oscillator feels more like puzzle-solving than a decision rooted in visible internal conflict or cost. Her "trembling hands" at the end assert emotion without prior embodied struggle, and the vindication moment skips over what she sacrifices or risks by succeeding. Backstory about "three decades" and her predecessor's death anchors motivation but does not create on-page friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's resiliently positive trait is announced but never tested through contradictory impulses or hard choices; he simply performs competent ferry work in surreal circumstances without internal friction. The mass of passengers exists as inert cargo rather than relationships under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("motivation crystallized with perfect clarity") and stock metaphors ("reality unspooled like loose rope") rather than embodied, character-particular perception. The final change—becoming "permanently transient"—is asserted without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" is declared but never dramatized through competing wants or visible internal conflict. The transformation into architecture is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—she becomes "part of the pattern" without any felt resistance or cost to her prior self. Interiority consists largely of abstract philosophical claims ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final dissolution reads passive, happening to her rather than chosen, undercutting agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her technical expertise grounds her choices, but interiority relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final decision to launch the expedition feels predetermined by her role rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses. Emotional states are labeled ("grief and cosmic wonder") more than dramatized through specific perception or physical response. The students remain functional props without applying meaningful relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to protect Mrs. Gable's testimony is clear, but her sudden decision to descend alone lacks internal conflict—no weighing of danger versus duty. The discovery of Thomas feels externally imposed rather than earned through her choices. Thomas's four-decade basement captivity registers as plot convenience without embodied trauma; his bird-bone fragility is told, not shown through action or speech. The ending gesture (holding the photograph) substitutes for a choice that would foreclose a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's claustrophobia and her professional contradiction are established early and paid off at closure when "her claustrophobia peaked, then shattered." The motivation to stand by the unremembered drives her descent, though the emotional turn feels somewhat declarative rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Interior voice remains consistent, but the final transformation lacks the visceral contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the epiphany reads slightly unearned because we don't see her wrestle with competing fears in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's heartbeat counting and porcelain grip provide embodied anchors, and her goal to understand the erasure motivates the defragmentation sequence. However, the character lacks meaningful internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; she executes her plan without visible hesitation or cost until the final integration, which reads as more mystical than earned through prior struggle. The backstory (death certificate error, digital purge) is dense but remains mostly expository context rather than active pressure that forces choice adjustments on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The copper-veined storyteller has a clear goal (preserve language) but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than contradictory or embodied. The diamond's hunger and the elder's offstage death provide pressure, but the protagonist's internal conflict never surfaces as simultaneous competing impulses in scene. Her final action feels procedurally executed rather than earned through visible struggle with a personal cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The transformation into cryptid reads as abstract metamorphosis without embodied cost—her "teeth now slightly too sharp" arrives as cosmetic detail rather than a choice that forecloses a human path. Marcus exists only in backstory and phone static; no on-page relationship pressure tests her commitment. Internal conflict is summarized ("her rage... her grief... her desire") rather than shown through simultaneous competing impulses during the pivotal phone moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("insurgent of beauty," "gap between knowing and understanding") rather than embodied contradiction. The violinist's choices drive the climax, but internal conflict appears as stated theme rather than simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene. The statues' transformation from guardians to wonderers feels convenient—no prior micro-choice dramatizes their vulnerability to music before the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's motivation is clear and his micro-choices (timing the drone window, placing specific letters) show agency under pressure. Internal contradiction appears in his simultaneous respect for authority and willingness to break the drone border, though the "respectfully rebellious" frame risks label-speak. The final choice—sealing the bottle and retreating—feels more like routine completion than a path foreclosed with visible cost; the piece reads more as a portrait of habitual resistance than a story where this particular mail drop forces a meaningful change or endurance with new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's thirteen-year silence and persistent carpentry are established traits with consistent embodiment through the observation of "wood grain, to wind, to the spaces between heartbeats." His unlocking voice and decision to return with tools shows a choice with cost. However, the piece leans heavily on reflection and summary rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure; the motivation is richly told but the on-page conflict is largely internal meditation. The final stance feels less earned by dramatic struggle than by lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation is declared ("to reawaken the narrative") but never tested by on-page contradiction or cost; she succeeds without friction. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("sanely eccentric," "observed solitude") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's memory functions as exposition rather than a live conflict that shapes Elena's present choices. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs; the final smile signals completion without foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to recapture the dream is clear, but her interior life reads as abstract label-speak ("hollow," "gray") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of capturing the dream lacks visible cost—she simply succeeds without forfeiting anything on the page or confronting a genuine limit. Micro-choices are absent; she moves through a predetermined sequence without struggle that would reveal hierarchy of values. The character functions as a vehicle for poetic imagery rather than an agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vey's motivation to free the trapped idea is established early, but her interiority remains abstract—"enigmatic locksmith" functions more as archetype than embodied character. The poet companion backstory anchors emotional stakes, yet Vey's micro-choices during the spinning ritual feel mechanically aligned to the metaphysical task rather than revealing internal contradiction or cost. The final smile registers satisfaction but no visible foreclosure or renunciation that would demonstrate character alteration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her thirty-year observational habit anchors character, but the final choice feels more procedural than contradictory—she moves from witness to actor without visible internal friction. The backstory (Lila's transformation) is well-anchored and primes the closure, but Elena's embodied emotion during the peak beat leans on stock gestures ("hands trembled") rather than character-particular sensation. The renunciation of her observational stance carries conceptual weight, yet the moment she steps into the ring lacks the visceral cost or competing impulse that would push this into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior is textured and particular—"walked backwards when nervous" is embodied in scene and constrains her movement under pressure. The shadow's arc from trembling to "reaching not for escape but for readiness" is earned through three weeks of tea-leaf annotation. Minor slip: "combative tenderness of a mother bird" leans toward label-speak at a peak beat, though the immediate dramatization ("Fear is the first lesson") recovers quickly. The final choice to walk forward beside the child closes Elara's own arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, but his choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The interior voice relies heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("insatiably creative," "radiant hush") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the seed-planting sequence involves symbolic gestures but no visceral struggle or contradictory impulses. The ending offers stasis without visible cost—Elian simply succeeds and sits "content," foreclosing no path.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to ground spirits is coherent and her self-revelation about breaking her mask intentionally shows internal complexity. The confession-as-ceremony structure provides emotional progression, though the interiority leans toward abstract declarations ("I am broken," "Only a cracked vessel can hold this kind of silence") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final transformation into a repository feels conceptually earned but the choice itself unfolds without visible struggle or renunciation cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is articulated clearly and her methodical approach shapes choices, but the piece delivers more portraiture than dramatic contradiction under pressure. Her fifteen-year expertise is told rather than tested by an on-page dilemma that forces competing impulses to clash. The final choice to leave the map torn is consistent but arrives without visible forfeiture; the prior beats demonstrate competence and care without forced tradeoff. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than embodied in simultaneous competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian's interiority is specific and embodied through his analytic lens ("calculating the resonance required," "wave equations and the specific gravity of grief"). His relationship with Death as a personified companion provides consistent character texture. The final choice to leave the globe behind demonstrates earned restraint with visible cost—he records the message but honors the captain's sanctuary. Minor weakness: the protagonist observes more than he struggles; internal contradiction could sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is present but relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses in action. Her three-decade project and final encoding are motivated, but the emotional stakes remain told through label-like phrases ("mechanical sorrow," "learned to love") rather than embodied in scene choices. The ghost's loneliness is asserted more than dramatized through resistant behavior. No meaningful internal conflict complicates her encoding; she proceeds smoothly toward a predetermined endpoint without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is specific and embodied through her handling of the goggles and diary, with clear motivation rooted in curiosity rather than practical service. The captain's characterization through diary entries balances despair with sensory precision effectively. The transformation from "warmly inquisitive" observer to inheritor of the captain's discipline is earned through the accumulated discoveries during ascent. Minor slip: the final realization about "disciplined capacity to study one's own pain" edges toward diagnostic articulation, though it remains grounded in the captain's concrete example.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is heavily reflective rather than embodied under pressure. The private taxonomy of clouds-as-emotions and the metaphor of "spooled wholeness" read as authorial poetry rather than character-particular cognition during a life-threatening drift. Her micro-choices (adjusting the telescope, tying knots) exist but lack genuine internal contradiction or cost—she never debates whether to signal for help, ration resources, or fear death. The final acceptance feels philosophically neat rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's face-blindness is embodied through tactile perception ("constellations of texture," "architecture of bone beneath skin") that shapes how she paints. Her motivation burns urgently through the condemned timeline, driving concrete micro-choices: withdrawing the coin, climbing to the dome, applying fractally precise strokes. The final choice to walk away without watching carries visible cost—she carries the sky within but loses the physical space—though the renunciation feels slightly muted by the prophetic certainty she's already achieved her goal. Internal contradiction could be sharper; her hyper-competence in translating her condition into art leaves little room for genuine struggle or miscalculation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly rooted in intellectual curiosity and her apprenticeship, with her isolated state embodied in spoken-aloud habits. However, her interior life reads more as thematic summary than contradictory impulse—her journey from loneliness to revelation proceeds smoothly without genuine internal friction. The "sociable isolation" is asserted rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. The final whispered thanks and smile feel decorative rather than earned by a visible cost that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives her through the archive, but her interior life remains thin—she never experiences doubt, fear of failure, or contradictory impulses under pressure. The moment of understanding ("not in the forcing… but in listening") arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than being dramatized through struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; we see her "trembling fingers" but little visceral registration of cold, exhaustion after three days' climb, or the weight of village survival on her shoulders. The choice at the pedestal lacks meaningful cost or internal conflict; the mechanism assembles itself while she watches.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to trust Thomas's ghost messages is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her final action (ringing the bell, beginning rounds) feels enacted rather than earned by visible internal cost. The interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("kinship," "permanent yet strange," "brambled hope") that substitutes labels for embodied contradiction. Thomas exists only as benevolent function; no friction emerges between his altruism and the survivors' needs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is presented through elevated poetic language ("bruised awe," "accumulated whispers") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation to "vouchsafe peace" is declared and philosophically glossed but never tested by a conflicting impulse or material constraint that forces a micro-choice with visible cost. The final act—placing the puppet head and singing—reads as the fulfillment of a pre-set ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative. Backstory dominates (~40% reflective density) without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her brother's death, and her reluctant competence is consistently embodied through physical gestures ("welding gloves," muttered complaints). The mechanical precision of placing nuts reads authentic. However, interiority remains surface-level—grief is mentioned but not contradictory or pressured, and the final exhaustion is stated rather than felt through degraded perception or micro-choice friction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interior world is richly textured through her chemist's lens, with consistent perceptual filtering (polymer chains, stress fractures, surface tension). The transformation from grief as "constricting band" to "flowing thing" tracks credibly through the river observation. However, the final epiphany arrives without sufficient on-page struggle—she understands Maya's unfinished symphony and forgives herself in a single contemplative arc without meaningful internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The micro-choices (descending, tracing foam, placing chrysalis) are observational rather than pressure-testing her competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is heavy on abstraction ("integrated fragmentation," "quantifying absence") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to find "the place where stories begin" is declared but never faces a concrete test that forces a trade-off until the final paragraph, where she steps through without visible internal conflict. The choice to abandon parole and cart feels more asserted than earned by prior micro-decisions under pressure. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we see measurement and gesture but no visceral hesitation or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's central motivation—to process accumulated grief—is established early and drives her descent into the pavilion. However, her emotional arc is largely told through metaphor ("sandpaper rough memories") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The glove removal and hand-placing feel symbolic rather than choices that reveal competing internal pressures. The final claim of steadiness and forgiveness reads as declared outcome rather than earned transformation through visible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara remains a vehicle for thematic demonstration rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her seventeen-year preparation and "trembling but resolute" stance are told, not earned through on-page choice under pressure. The piece describes her empathetic decisiveness and linguistic skill but never dramatizes a moment where these traits force her into a genuine trade-off or mistake. The diplomatic operation succeeds mechanically without visible cost to her body, pride, or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elena's interiority is overwhelmed by abstract philosophical language rather than embodied emotion under pressure. Lines like "synaptic pathways of her brain were rewriting themselves with the ferocity of winter rivers breaking ice" offer metaphorical decoration without revealing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "modify the entanglement" lacks clear motivation rooted in concrete desire; we see elaborate imagery but no genuine internal conflict between what she wants and what she fears. The character reads as a vehicle for conceptual demonstration rather than a person making costly decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly (retrieve the combinations) but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction: "prism-minded consciousness," "refracted angles of possibility," "spectral analysis of her thoughts." These terms gesture toward a trait system rather than embodying her lived perception under pressure. The margin doodle micro-choice and the decision to take one seed show agency, but emotional contradiction is absent—she executes her plan without internal conflict or cost that forecloses a live path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and particular—"symphonically minded, her brain wiring patterns around rhythms that no longer existed"—and her goal is clear. The tree-reading method embodies her empathy through embodied micro-choices (finger tracing, bow pressure). However, the hedgehog remains ornamental, and the final breakthrough lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path; she weeps but no prior option is abandoned. Internal contradiction is minimal; the arc is more discovery than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Castian's interior is dense and specific, driven by exile's weight and the need to redeem his failure. The worry stone provides embodied emotional anchoring, and his shift from "precision without feeling" to embracing difficult beauty is earned through seven years of reflection. However, the final choice—moving pieces along magnetic trajectories—remains abstract; we see the *claim* of transformation but not a vivid, contradictory impulse acting in scene. The stone splitting feels symbolic rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elio's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("theatrical sincerity," "architecture of quiet") rather than embodied contradiction. His actions—adjusting oscillators, sensing vibrations—read as allegorical gestures rather than choices under pressure that reveal competing impulses. The climax (clasp opening) feels preordained by his method rather than earned through internal struggle or visible cost. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path is legible; he catalogs silence without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly drawn—ambitious herbalist seeking transformation through the corpse flower—and her olfactory sensitivity shapes how she experiences the world. However, her internal conflict remains largely abstract; the tension between ambition and anticipated suffering is told rather than tested through concrete on-page choices under pressure. The climactic planting scene lacks a moment where contradictory impulses force a visible trade-off, and her grandmother's "trembling hand" observation comes too late to complicate Elara's own choices in real time. Interiority often defaults to elevated, explanatory diction ("emotional architecture of her ambition") that flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to find the source of resilience is clear and drives her through the inverted landscape, but her interior remains thin—she operates as a conduit for exposition rather than a character under genuine pressure. The "resilience wasn't biological but memorial" realization arrives as a download rather than an earned insight shaped by prior contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse; her stomach lurches once, but most beats externalize observation without internal friction or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The ending gesture (touching the artifact, receiving knowledge) lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's professional interiority is concrete and particular—measuring wind velocities, reverse-engineering disaster—with embodied detail (respirator pressing, pupils dilating). However, the story withholds her emotional stakes beyond the professional drive to prevent future disasters; Chen's death elicits curiosity more than grief or moral weight. The moment she "smiled despite the respirator" feels unearned—no prior contradiction or cost justifies satisfaction amid catastrophe. Internal conflict is absent; she moves from mystery to solution without friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Her seventeen years of training and singular drive to "certify wonder" remain abstract labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The synesthetic condition is described richly but functions as ornamental perception rather than constraining any on-page decision. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she executes her plan without friction, cost, or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is established early and drives her return to the rift, but her interior remains abstract—terms like "driven relic keeper" and "cosmic tension" label rather than embody contradiction. The climactic correction feels more like executing a known technique than a choice under pressure; we see no on-page hesitation or competing impulse when she plays the final notes. Emotional progression is summarized ("understanding that some guardianships must end") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's drive to quantify emotion is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains abstract—we see her *operate* personalities rather than feel contradictory impulses act simultaneously. The cartographer arrives as a vehicle for her experiment, not as a person with autonomous pressure, flattening the crucible potential. The ending forecloses her path (he becomes "another font"), but the cost reads conceptual rather than embodied; no micro-choice under competing wants dramatizes the trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear interior progression from "jittery" to "jittery no more," but the transformation feels declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The pendant's vibration serves as an external trigger rather than earned internal conflict forcing a choice with visible cost. Maren's absence as motivation is told through backstory rather than pressing on present decisions in a way that creates genuine struggle. Minor: the archivist remains functionally generic, applying pressure without distinct voice or stake.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear—seventeen years documenting emotional residue in objects—but her interiority remains generic and label-driven ("the shifted hush moved from the forest into her chest"). The mystic's actions align with her goal, yet no internal contradiction or embodied struggle surfaces; she moves through the scene with near-perfect competence. The widow's hands appear via prism refraction, a clever device, but Elara's own emotional stakes never press against her certainty. Backstory exceeds the ~20% guideline without anchoring present micro-choices that tilt her stance, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies toward the ending (weaving herself into the message), but her interior life reads as abstracted rather than embodied—grief operates at arm's length through metaphor rather than contradictory impulse. The final sacrifice (becoming transparent, dissolving into the tapestry) arrives without visible micro-choices that narrow options; the shift from "hardening into something translucent" to full dissolution lacks dramatized hesitation or trade-off. Interiority leans heavily on poetic declaration ("wistful nature hardening into something translucent and terrible") rather than specific, character-particular thought under pressure. The daughter's disappearance thirty winters ago functions as backstory primer but does not tilt a present choice on the page until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "meek blacksmith" trait is labeled repeatedly rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to restore the orchards is clear, but interior contradiction is absent—she moves with "unwavering" determination throughout, never second-guessing or hesitating in ways that would reveal competing impulses. The descent and silk-barter sequence shows deliberate action but no visible cost that forecloses a credible alternative path; the ending grants restoration without meaningful struggle or sacrifice that tests her meekness against her resolve.

    Elara's motivation to discover her mentor's secret is clear and drives her through the bay, but her internal conflict remains abstract—we see her cataloging sensory data rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses about whether she *should* uncover this truth. The final choice to "honor" rather than redirect feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing goods. Embodied emotion is scarce; most interiority consists of perceptual metaphors ("heard not sound but distance") that describe her mapping ability but don't reveal character-specific stakes or flaws under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and contradictory—she protects silence while bottling safety, embodied in her handling of sea glass and cairn-building. Her "warmly observant" trait constrains choices (noticing rust, gull avoidance) and the final renunciation of the written letter shows genuine cost. Interiority occasionally slips toward elevated diction ("crystalline clarity," "luminescent ache") that reads slightly above a working skipper's natural register under pressure, though voice remains mostly coherent. The ghosts' presence is atmospheric but their agency never truly tests Elara's choices, leaving secondary pressure underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts (shadowed elation, accidentally prophetic) without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The character performs ritualized actions but does not face a genuine dilemma that tests commitment with visible cost. Agency reads as ceremonial rather than decision-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dye master's interiority is concrete and specific ("heart beating with borrowed rhythm," "ribs that still felt like foreign architecture"), and her watchfulness creates a consistent perceptual filter. The pivotal realization—that the donor remained "porous, allowing the world to pass through her without resistance"—arrives through sustained observation rather than unmotivated epiphany. However, the transformation reads more as conceptual understanding than embodied choice that forecloses options with visible cost; the final release of the wing is symbolic rather than a decision that alters tactics or relationships. The metaphoric density occasionally edges toward label-speak ("valley-mist wonder," "explosive quiet") without sufficient embodied grounding in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks understanding of the trees' memories—but her decisive agency arrives late. The climactic actions (deconstructing vials, pouring sorrow onto roots) feel enacted rather than chosen under dueling impulses. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("maintenance work was worship") rather than embodied contradiction, though the healing-hands detail grounds some physical experience. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending grants resolution without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to rekindle the realm is clear and her scattered-self embodiment offers conceptual interest, but her agency reads as mythic performance rather than choice under pressure. The "desperation of one who knew that creation required both freedom and constraint" tells rather than dramatizes internal conflict. The ghost-orchardists and reflection-gardeners appear only as a collective response without individuated pressure or relationship friction. The final gathering of her selves feels like a consequence of ritual completion rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's empathetic reclusion is established through seventeen years of behavior and his felt connection to travelers' emotions. His final choice to retreat while leaving the door unlatched embodies his contradictory impulses, though the mechanics of "feeling her loneliness radiate through the masonry" verge on unearned ESP rather than credible empathy. The young woman remains a mirror device without autonomous pressure; she exists to receive Elias's gift rather than to challenge him with competing agency. Internal contradiction is present but the resolution leans toward elegant symmetry rather than messy, embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and coherent—finding the sacred in the ordinary through guerrilla gardening—but interiority leans abstract and label-heavy ("creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle") rather than embodied contradiction. The final sharing scene shows a micro-choice with cost (offering the bread pudding), yet the progression feels more illustrative than driven by genuine internal conflict. The other tea-house regulars remain gestural presences without applying immediate pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("understanding that redemption did not arrive as thunder") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—to witness and preserve meaning—is consistent and embodied through "gently meticulous" actions (calipers, sampling, ledger work). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between procedural discipline and despair, visible when "urgency tightened her chest" yet her movements remain controlled. The final realization ("to measure is to love what cannot be saved") feels earned by the progression from duty to comprehension. However, the protagonist remains largely passive observer rather than agent making choices that alter outcomes; she documents rather than decides.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to record the betrayal is clear, but her internal experience remains surface-level—she "knows" and "feels" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The disguised phonograph mechanism is clever, yet her choices during the stakeout (feigned drunkenness, calculated positioning) read more as competent procedure than decisions born from embodied fear or competing loyalties. The ending forecloses the lieutenant's path, but the cost to Mara herself—what she risks or sacrifices beyond completing the task—remains abstract. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "comforting unease settle into her bones" and "sound of trust breaking crystalline and sharp."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("luminous skepticism," "phosphorescent with doubt") rather than embodied contradiction. Her final transformation into "the emergent compass" is declared rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose options with visible cost. The three weather-bearers remain flat devices whose dialogue delivers exposition about their function rather than revealing character under pressure. Internal conflict is summarized as "doubt transform[ing]…into function, into purpose" without dramatizing the competing impulses that would make such a shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is verbose but diagnostically labeled ("mnemonically gifted, a curse," "inescapable calling") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to abandon the surface is told as realization ("Elara understood then") instead of dramatized through conflicting wants that force visible cost. Emotions are frequently asserted ("auroral sorrow," "feverish precision") rather than shown through specific bodily sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's agency at closure reads as epiphany delivery, not earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aurelia's motivation is consistent—searching for lost letters to rebuild trust—but her interior life remains abstract. The wilting-leaf mechanism works as a device but doesn't generate meaningful internal conflict or force contradictory impulses in scene. Marcus's confession is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The transformation at the end (leaves unfurling) feels declared rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—she works alone throughout, so the attribute functions as atmospheric detail rather than dramatic friction. Her motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is asserted repeatedly but never tested against a competing want or obstacle that would force a values-hierarchy choice. The final "success" moment lacks the earned contradiction or renunciation that would demonstrate character change; she completes a project without internal conflict or visible forfeiture. Interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael-9's internal journey from paralyzed nostalgia to operational peace is clearly traced through embodied choices (initiating the burn, carrying the box, planting the cutting). The android's fear of deletion and solitude materializes in concrete action rather than abstract summary. However, the interiority occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("fragmented wholeness," "strangely organic") that reads label-like rather than fully dramatized. The final renunciation—sealing the box while burning what's necessary—earns the shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's core motivation (prove that listening heals) is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her seventeen-year curator role is asserted but doesn't constrain her investigative choices; she moves through the neighborhood gathering stories without visible cost or internal friction. Mr. Alvarez's moment at the mailbox carries embodied weight, but Maya's role remains observational rather than decisively active. The agency gap and lack of on-page trade-offs prevent higher scoring despite solid supporting characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is abstract and thematically articulated ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") but never tested against a competing desire or obstacle that forces a visible tradeoff. Her movements are described extensively yet no micro-choice shows her hierarchy of values under pressure; she executes a predetermined choreography without internal friction. The "lyrical code breaker" label lacks embodied contradiction—she never misreads, hesitates, or pays a personal cost for her method. Closure treats liberation as complete without dramatizing what she forfeits or how prior restraint shaped this final act.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior logic is consistent—she abandons her post for exploration, reads patterns, and exhumes with recognizable determination. Her motivation to find deleted memories is clear, but the recognition beats ("trembled from the recognition of approaching revelation") lean into label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment with the wildflowers carries emotional weight, but the journey feels more like following breadcrumbs than making choices under pressure. The piece lacks a meaningful internal conflict or foreclosed path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The solitary summoner remains conceptual rather than embodied—no contradictory impulses act in scene, no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority consists of elevated abstractions ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") rather than character-particular perception. The work is completed through described technique without visible struggle or cost that would foreclose a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the prophecy is contained off-stage through summary.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation to learn building language is clear and her choices escalate logically, but the interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphorical description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Elias functions more as exposition device than pressuring force—he teaches without resistance, and his spectral nature is noted ("Maya learned that Elias had died in 1987") but never complicates her choices with visible cost. The ending gesture (pressing seals together) reads as symbolic completion rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path. Internal conflict is stated thematically ("interrogate the silence") but not dramatized through competing wants that force visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (archiving dangerous memories) is established, but her interior life is dominated by abstract philosophical statements rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation from skeptic to someone who "understood now that to translate isolation into independence required not the rejection of others' burdens" arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized micro-choices that foreclose options. The "ghostly resolve" and "charmed skeptic" remain largely labels; her interiority reads as elevated meditation on themes rather than character-particular perception. No visible cost at closure that changes her circumstances or forecloses a path—she walks toward morning light with philosophical understanding but no dramatized sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—forging peace through calibrated treason—but her interiority relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The character remains largely static across the piece; her "wisely enduring" stance is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("finally wept") rather than shown through physical breakdown or contradictory impulse. The blood-drawing with the rose thorn gestures toward embodied cost but reads more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation to understand her sister's echo is clear, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses. The final choice to "ensure the Echoed Ones were honored" arrives as declaration without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page. Embodied emotion is scarce; the "reed-blown melancholy" remains a label rather than enacted pressure. The "richly perceptive" attribute functions as a told trait without on-page tradeoffs or mistakes driven by that very perception.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to expose truth is consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("weaving truth carefully," "salvage something pure") rather than embodied contradiction. The ghost captain's hesitation offers a window, yet Elara's micro-choices feel driven by authorial design rather than lived stakes—she moves through research and pronouncement without visible internal friction. The final promise to "weave your truth carefully" lands as thematic echo rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interior life is richly textured through her philosophy of knots and patterns, and her micro-choices (pausing to study the net, using the whisk as a whistle) are character-specific. However, the piece lacks genuine internal contradiction—her worldview is presented as fully formed wisdom without competing impulses or visceral doubt under pressure. The final satisfaction "that needed no witness" reads as earned philosophical stance rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but never destabilizes her contemplative equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation as debunker is clear and her final choice to repair rather than destroy is earned by the letters. However, her interiority reads as explanatory rather than contradictory—she observes, deduces, explains, but never wrestles with competing impulses in scene. The settlers' fear is told rather than dramatized through individual reactions, and their accusation arrives without prior friction to charge it. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats summarize her mental work rather than showing her under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian is established as a "lonely visionary" with vivid particulars (mushroom beard, seventeen months of signals), and his variant allegiance—worshipping the fracture, not the prophet—provides a clear motive. However, his agency remains passive observation and ritual preparation; he adjusts dials, listens, arranges aerials, but never faces a choice under pressure that costs him something on the page. The final act (projecting shadows, whispering counter-words) unfolds without internal contradiction or visible sacrifice, making his arc feel more like enactment of a predetermined role than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his jar collection and the specific memory of abandoning his daughter. Internal contradiction surfaces in the juxtaposition of hoarding versus delivery, though the transition from isolation to action feels somewhat abrupt. The backstory exceeds 30% but anchors in present stimuli (music box discovery) and drives the closure choice. Emotional progression is credible, moving from wistful collection to active pursuit with visible cost (leaving the loft).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to protect the artifact is signaled early, but her interiority defaults to label-heavy abstractions ("logically emotional," "calculated soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The key choice—singing to dissolve the hunters—arrives without prior dramatized conflict between her engineering detachment and emotional depth; the duality is asserted, not enacted. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (trembling hands, racing pulse), but the climax substitutes therapeutic self-description for genuine struggle under pressure. The final collapse reads as ritual exhaustion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to escape and her patient discipline are clearly established, but interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("restrained wildness," "sculpt patience from impatience") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously. The followers remain generic shadows with no individuated pressure. The final choice—crossing the viaduct—feels predetermined by the setup rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses; her pounding heart is mentioned but never dramatizes genuine internal conflict that might derail the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation to break from Elias's influence shows clear interiority and embodied grief (kneeling, trembling hands steadied by deliberate breaths). The professional investigator role generates consistent observational micro-choices throughout. However, the character relies heavily on abstract constructions like "fortified vulnerability manifesting" and "entangled memories" that lean toward label-speak rather than lived contradiction. The final pivot—using his methods as "a weapon"—feels asserted more than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority remains consistent—guilt-driven resolve anchored in seventeen years of self-doubt—and his final choice (public vindication) traces cleanly from early regret. However, his emotional arc relies heavily on summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction; the phrase "secretly doubted could be redeemed" leans diagnostic, and the repairman remains a functional prop without pressure or status friction. The chaplain's micro-choices (unwrapping the heart, placing his palm as oath) signal commitment, but the peak beat delivers epiphany via convenient light rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kip's motivation to ring the inaudible bell is established early and shapes their persistent activity. The interiority is distinctive—"steadily curious," "irreverent awe"—and the character's three-century persistence reads as trait-driven endurance. However, the final act (snapping the arrow tip to lock the cog) lacks embodied hesitation or competing impulse; the choice feels executed rather than wrestled with. The renunciation of the kaleidoscope and the laughter afterward carry some felt weight, but internal contradiction during the peak beat would have lifted this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she hunts for deleted data—but her seventeen-year tenure and sudden breakthrough feel convenient rather than earned through prior struggle. The astronaut discovery triggers investigation but her choices feel externally directed by the mystery rather than forcing contradictory impulses. Internal conflict is minimal; she moves smoothly from clue to clue without embodied hesitation or cost until the final broadcast, which arrives without visible sacrifice. The ending choice lacks a genuine forfeiture that tests competing values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced peacekeeper") without embodied contradiction. The shadows function as external threat-detectors rather than dramatizing internal conflict. The mirror solution feels authored rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her competence is declared but never genuinely threatened—no moment where intuition fails or costs her something immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is densely rendered through metaphor and sensory detail, creating a distinct interior landscape. However, the transformation from suicide tourist to someone who "grips reality loosely" arrives through poetic assertion rather than a dramatized contradiction of impulses acting in scene. The parasol tip handling and the child's shoe moment provide embodied choices, but the final decision remains in equipoise without visible foreclosure of a path. Motivation is consistent but the change feels more declared than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interior life is richly textured with embodied contradiction—she resists Marcus's philosophy while her solitude teaches otherwise—and the charred letter functions as a concrete anchor for memory. The final renunciation (no longer waiting, letter composting) shows earned stasis with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("intersubjective understanding," "productive tension") that reads more like essay than crisis-bound thought. Marcus remains a construct rather than a pressure-applying presence, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The line walker's motivations are declared ("to preserve the echo of wisdom") but rarely tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions—spiraling approach, removing the mask, singing the binding song—follow a ritualistic sequence without dramatized internal conflict or visible cost that would foreclose a path. The "strangely honest" attribute appears as a repeated label rather than shaping a difficult choice. Embodied emotion is minimal; most interiority consists of perceptual reporting rather than contradictory desires acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's interior remains consistently perceptive and calm, but she functions more as a conduit than an agent making difficult choices. Her motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is declared early but never tested by on-page conflict or personal cost—the townspeople simply arrive, recognize, and heal. The piece tells us she "intended to linger" and that she "realized now that the masterpiece was not the archive itself," but these shifts lack embodied friction or micro-choices that foreclose alternatives. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; her arc is smooth observation rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to preserve language is clear and her reticent nature is embodied through silence and observation. However, she remains largely passive—her "choices" amount to placing a crystal and tracing lichen. The final act of placement lacks urgency or internal conflict; no contradictory impulses complicate her stance. The weathered innocence and deliberate stillness read more as static traits than struggles that evolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior state is richly embodied through concrete sensory anchors (rust taste, chalk dust, sternum vibration), and the precognitive forgetting creates a distinct cognitive constraint. The protagonist's compulsion to capture sound before erasure drives micro-choices throughout (arranging markers, writing notations). However, the final loop—beginning again with new arrows—feels more illustrative of futility than a motivated choice with visible cost, weakening the closure's agency component.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" drives her refusal to evacuate and her climb to the chronometer room, but her interior experience remains abstract and cerebral rather than embodied. The key choice—playing the leaf recording—arrives without visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her forty-year backstory and chemical-stained fingers gesture toward characterization, but the final transformation into "the changelessly constant element herself" reads as asserted transcendence rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivations are clear and professional; her decisively kind intervention shifts Maya's posture from weapon-bearing to witness. Maya's arc from hostile fragment-clutcher to someone who understands broken beauty is earned through Elena's hymning and the shared vinyl moment. The embodied emotion (knuckles white, shoulders dropping) grounds the abstraction. Minor: Mr. Hale remains somewhat passive, though his lucid moment and final breath carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained across the piece, and her choices drive the action. However, her interiority remains largely observational and declarative rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The custodian's shadow functions primarily as exposition vehicle rather than a relationship under pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("driven by a singular obsession") but not dramatized through competing desires in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's arc from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who "forgave us both for being wrong" shows clear trajectory, and her micro-choices (kneeling, bone-setting, giving the tooth) carry embodied weight. However, her motivation to "turn mistakes into constellations" feels asserted rather than dramatized through prior conflict—the metaphor arrives as a label. The changeling's "shrewdly innocent" trait is told more than shown in contradictory action, and Elena's expertise in both medicine and faerie lore reads convenient. Internal contradiction is present in her shift from rigid rationalism to magical midwife, but the transition lacks visible struggle or cost that would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's inner contradiction is present—the tension between her destructive past and her current restraint—but the work lacks embodied struggle in peak moments. Her polishing is rendered as "meditation" and "devotional extremes" rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to accept the pearl feels preordained rather than earned through visible on-page cost that forecloses another path. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("accumulated silences," "density of years") instead of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is consistent and embodied through concrete rituals (pressing moss, placing the pendant). Internal contradiction appears weakly: she alternates between retreat and reframing without simultaneous tension. The sister backstory remains abstract—"the truth Elara had spoken into the void"—limiting emotional specificity. Micro-choices (kneeling, removing pendant, pressing moss) show watchful stewardship but lack a genuine on-page mistake or complication that would deepen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's conflicted state is declared but rarely tested through on-page choices that narrow options. Her "method" of ephemeral cameo appearances is told in summary—Paris café, Tokyo puddle—without dramatized friction or visible cost in the present. The kneeling ceremony feels gestural rather than rooted in embodied contradiction; her "conflict" eases without forfeiting a live alternative. Interior voice leans heavily on abstract philosophical register ("architectures of possibility," "geometry of aspiration") that distances us from her immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's whimsical tinkerer identity remains largely ornamental—stated through props (copper wire, lavender, chronometer) but never meaningfully tested or constrained by her core trait. The ritual choice lacks internal contradiction; she proceeds smoothly through the ceremony without embodied struggle, doubt, or cost visible in her micro-choices. Embodiment is present in sensory detail ("fingers danced," "rusty at first"), but emotional complexity dissolves into clean competence at the climax. Agency exists in the singing choice, yet the execution feels assured rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (translating heartbeats into maps) is stated clearly but remains abstract throughout; the internal conflict between speed (her usual craft) and patience is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's orchard backstory anchors motive but doesn't tilt present decisions. Interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("cartography of blood," "tectonic shift") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular, and the final "task complete" moment lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths—she simply finishes what she set out to do.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is characterized through his locksmith's precision and peripherally-focused observation method, but his interiority remains abstract—his motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" is philosophically stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The nine days of patient mapping establish competence but not struggle; no genuine obstacle or internal conflict forces a difficult trade-off. The final winding of the mainspring arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading more as task completion than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains abstract throughout; we see no micro-choices under pressure, only allegorical labor described in ornate language. Her "boundary-lessly trapped" state is told but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final sequence (collecting weights, sitting with them) reads as ritual completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists almost entirely of metaphoric summary rather than embodied perception or goal-driven thought.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is embodied through tactile woodworking choices and the physicality of grief ("rust-hued peace settling over her shoulders like an old shawl"). The progression from containment through ritual to the practical immortality of the handle shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction: some emotional states lean toward articulation rather than contradiction in action ("grief, like wild animals, required containment through ritual rather than force" reads slightly thesis-like). The final stance—carving memory into daily use—feels motivated by the widow's specific history with Viktor's circus world.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior is richly textured with temporal confusion and regret, but motivation remains abstract—she seeks to "negotiate with one's own ghost" without clear stakes or contradictory impulses driving scene choices. The ghost exchange feels more like thematic illustration than lived conflict; Mara's "eroded ambitions" are told in metaphor rather than embodied through a visible trade-off. The final transfer reads as conceptual rather than earned by prior micro-choices that cost her something legible on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions") appears repeatedly without dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's engineering mindset is consistently rendered through her perception of systems and flows, and her choices trace logically from survey to salvage to retrofit. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("stoic wonder," "equations for hope") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final stance—sitting cross-legged, writing equations—feels more summarized than earned through visible struggle or competing impulses in scene. No other character pressures her choices, so relationship dynamics remain untested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is textured through seventeen years of clock work and the metronome's weight, with genuine embodied tension in her kneeling and handling of the brass case. The core choice—setting down rather than carrying forward—is earned by the forecourt's qualities and her sustained interiority. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("ghost tempo haunting her careful, clockwork existence") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the resolution feels more meditative than dramatically tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is consistent and voice-specific, particularly in her embodied realization that "cumulative deviation" led her astray. The shift from seeking treasure to "understanding the architecture of lies" is motivated, and the final choice to "study their construction" reads as earned renunciation with visible cost. However, the emotional progression remains somewhat cerebral—phrases like "serene upheaval of her worldview settling into a new configuration" tell more than embody, and the heart-breaking/healing simultaneity at the cottage feels too tidy. The piece stays in Mara's perceptual lane without head-hopping, but the reflective mode occasionally abstracts emotion into labels rather than letting contradictory impulses collide in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is motivated by preservation and demonstrates patience, but his interiority remains abstract and archetypal. The piece labels him "infinitely patient" and "philosophical seed collector" without showing contradictory impulses or flaws that complicate his choices. The fisherman is a cipher who "watched without speaking," contributing no pressure. No meaningful cost or renunciation appears; Elias succeeds smoothly and walks away unchanged, foreclosing no path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied gestures—winding the thread, summoning the Duchess—but his motivation remains largely contemplative rather than choice-driven. The "projecting presence" method shows internal contradiction (grief versus artistic craft), yet the protagonist never confronts a fork that would test competing values with visible cost. The final decision to travel inland feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle. Emotional progression is coherent but lacks the friction of a character resisting his own insight.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation (reawakening beauty) is consistent and drives the central action, but his interior life reduces to abstract hypothesizing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climax—kneeling as the chick emerges—reads as inevitable relief rather than a choice with visible cost; we see no genuine struggle between competing impulses in the final beat. Emotions are declared ("bitterly sweet," "threatened to crush his ribs") more than shown through contradictory action. The bedraggled prince functions adequately but remains more archetype than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's core motivation is signaled early and her scars provide embodied history, but her choices in the present feel more symbolic than genuinely conflicted. The graft procedure itself unfolds without meaningful internal resistance or competing impulses acting simultaneously—she executes the plan rather than wrestling with it. The backstory (father's arson, truck choice) is extensive but remains told rather than filtering present perception with visible micro-costs. Interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("gracefully alert," "singing scars") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to liberate memories is clear, but her internal life is thin—she moves through the story as a function rather than a contradictory person under pressure. The "luminous skeptic" framing and "realistically imaginative mind" read as authorial assertion rather than embodied traits that constrain her choices. The final step-back lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; her skepticism is "satisfied" without dramatized struggle or renunciation. Interiority operates at label-level ("her doubt radiating," "quiet determination") rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("share light without using fire") is declared and her final action aligns with it, but the interiority remains abstract and diagnostic throughout—"compressed longing," "crystalline within her chest," "sentimental nature finally finding purpose"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The protagonist observes and processes cosmic history more than she struggles; the gear insertion feels inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict. No secondary character pressure tests her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation—to map collective grief—drives his choice to retrace letters rather than carve new ones, a meaningful renunciation with visible cost. His grandmother's spectral presence enables the shift but does not make decisions for him. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final understanding arrives through declarative insight ("Elias understood") rather than dramatized struggle. The choice to tie ribbons across graves is specific and purposeful, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains more stated than enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is characterized through precise, sensory details—the rake handle pressing against ribs, the forty-year habit of recording errors—that ground his ethical obsession in embodied action. His interior life shows genuine contradiction: he seeks "restoration of equilibrium between human intention and mechanical truth" rather than forgiveness, a distinction that gives him depth. The backstory integration is heavy (~35% of text) but each reflection anchors to present stimuli (the inscriptions, the pendulum pause) and primes the final adjustment. However, the climactic beat relies on forty years of offstage calculation rather than a choice made under present pressure, which mutes agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is consistent—discovering her ancestor's choices—but her journey lacks genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "understanding" arrives cleanly through puzzle-solving rather than forcing a difficult choice that forecloses a path. The final recognition feels more like intellectual completion than a decision with visible cost; she returns to her work "blithe as ever," which undercuts transformation. Interiority relies on elevated diction ("mapping the geometry of sacrifice") that reads more like theme assertion than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is rendered through abstraction and metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The piece tells us she is "groundedly imaginative" and a "cartographer of ignorance" but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment—setting down the quill—carries no visible emotional cost or foreclosed path; we're told transformation occurred but see no struggle or renunciation that would earn it. Label-heavy interiority ("sacred hour," "liquid rather than locked") substitutes for character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is characterized primarily through atmospheric description and stated interior rather than micro-choices under pressure. The goal to "teach dust to tell stories" is declared luminously but never tested by a dramatized obstacle that forces him to choose between competing goods. His "secretly luminous" quality and diligent copyist role remain label-level attributes; we never see him weighing a cost or making a decision that forecloses a path. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("ended the silence") without showing Elias enduring or renouncing anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is established through his seventeen-year pursuit and the ash-scattering ritual, but his choices feel more procedural than genuinely conflicted. The interior life leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("mirage of safety," "paradox") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of removing the mask and placing it on the chair reads as symbolic completion rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Interiority often reaches for elevated register ("somber marvel and dread") that distances rather than grounds emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through contradictory impulses: ego-driven preservation versus rational skepticism of his own myth-making ("recognized that he was constructing his own myth, that the preservation of chronometry served his ego as much as civilization"). His internal conflict is embodied through tactile action—chipping walls, tracing the cog's spiral—and his choice to excavate rather than debate carries visible cost (isolation, ongoing danger). The renunciation of surface confrontation in favor of underground teaching forecloses the path of open resistance with clear consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is motivated and his teaching mission is clear, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("expectantly resigned reverence," "traveled stillness") rather than embodied contradiction. The three students remain largely interchangeable; their trembling and leaning are gestural poverty without distinct internal conflict. The final transformation—seeing one another "not as enemies, but as musicians"—is asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to create beauty from ruins is signaled early, but her interior life is dominated by label-heavy abstractions ("informally wise," "synaptic plasticity," "phantom pains") rather than embodied contradiction. The final planting reads as executed ritual rather than a choice under pressure; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The chef's gift is told through metaphor ("tasting memories") but never dramatized in a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's involuntary truthfulness is established but operates as a label more than an on-page constraint that forecloses choices under pressure. His interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("preserve wonder," "poetry of their chaotic final flight") rather than embodied contradiction. The engineer appears late and remains a receptor for exposition rather than a pressure source. The final "smile at the fading light" gesture feels performed rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and specific ("creeping normality noticer," tracking displaced objects), and her embodied interactions with the orris root and cottage siding ground her in the moment. The character demonstrates agency through her systematic method of cataloging wrongness, and the final act of placing the orris root beside the crystalline silence feels earned by prior choices. However, internal contradiction is absent—Maya moves through her investigation without struggle or competing impulses, and the moment of understanding arrives smoothly rather than through dramatized conflict. The shift from observer to consecrator lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corvin's motivation—welcoming nuance into certainty—is conceptually clear and drives the threading action, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("prismatic doubt," "necrotic belief from healthy tissue") that flattens embodied emotion under pressure. The final stance crystallization (settling into silt, receptors open) reads as passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (murderers/saviors, prison/sanctuary) but operates as theme rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's grim optimism and cognitive approach are embodied through the charcoal proofs and dice handling, but her interior remains abstract and philosophically over-articulated rather than contradictory in scene. The final choice to "step through" feels more conceptual than psychologically earned; her hesitation at the brass door is told rather than dramatized with cost in the present. "Grim optimist by necessity, smiling at the cosmic absurdity" reads as a label that the narrative then illustrates rather than a lived contradiction acting under pressure. Dice and proofs function as symbolic tools but don't constrain her motives in a way that creates visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses or on-page friction. The insomnia serves as premise rather than dramatized struggle; she moves methodically through her task without wavering or cost that complicates her resolve. The grandmother's warning is delivered as backstory exposition rather than a present complication. Her final survey of glyphs feels like completion of a ritual rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with visible emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving refugee heritage—but her interior life remains largely abstract and declarative. The revelation about bread initials forming map coordinates is clever but arrives without embodied discovery; she simply "realizes" it while arranging loaves. Her final choice to document everything feels inevitable rather than conflicted, and we never see her struggle with competing goods or internal contradiction in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to escape fate is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract concepts ("bleak exhilaration," "stepping beyond fate's design") rather than embodied contradiction. The twenty-year isolation should generate more micro-choices and behavioral texture under pressure; instead we see declarative summary of her process. The final transformation reads as conceptual assertion—"becoming simultaneously younger and more permanent"—without the grounded cost or visceral detail that would anchor it in character-specific experience. Minor penalty for label-reliant interiority in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation (wanting her mother dead, orchestrating her own drowning) is declared in a climactic confession but lacks prior dramatic setup through on-page micro-choices that would make this revelation feel earned rather than announced. The interiority leans heavily on abstract constructs ("lingering luminance," "photographic curse") and label-speak ("repulsive allure," "unbosom the truth") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final renunciation (unpinning the clasp) reads as mechanical release rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible emotional cost. Internal conflict is summarized retrospectively instead of dramatized through competing impulses in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet's motivation is clear and embodied through action—striking the mallet, moving through trees—but interiority remains surface-level and declarative rather than contradictory. Key choices ("dubbed the storm complete," "gave it the name it had earned") are asserted outcomes rather than dramatized dilemmas with visible cost. The final stance—"For the prophet, there were no true obstacles"—undercuts tension by declaring immunity to struggle. Emotional states are primarily metaphorical ("motivation burned") rather than embodied through specific perception and micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "quietly driven" nature is embodied through her three-year study and precise ritual arrangement, but her interior contradictions remain thin—the fever beneath patience is asserted more than dramatized through competing impulses. The final choice between mapping and becoming feels inevitable given her arc, though the decision itself happens off-page (she picks up the whistle, signaling arrival). Her embodied state under pressure (trembling fingers, lifting the whistle) provides some texture, but the piece leans toward external action over layered internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interiority is largely expository ("she understood," "she realized") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The core choice—to publish with framing rather than expose or protect—arrives without genuine internal conflict shown in scene; her "emotionally rational" stance is asserted through label rather than dramatized through competing impulses. Minor positive: the final walk carries a hierarchy of values (truth vs. chaos) with visible renunciation of simpler options. The historian role remains functional but never forces a mistake or blind spot that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's professional motivation is clear and consistent—mapping abandoned dreams—but her interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The "stoically sensitive" attribute appears as description ("no gasp") rather than dramatized tension between competing impulses. Her final choice to return tomorrow reads as continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost, limiting the sense of genuine stakes or internal conflict driving the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation and his indexer role shapes his perceptual lens throughout. The internal process of forming and testing hypotheses demonstrates thought under pressure, and the final choice to "readjust the entire catalog" carries visible professional cost. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract analytical language ("alternative hypothesis crystallized into certainty") rather than embodied contradiction, and the character remains emotionally even throughout—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to transform grief into cranes emerges clearly, but interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphysical language ("soul untethers," "corporeal anchor") rather than embodied contradiction. The final dispersal reads as surrender rather than a choice that forecloses options with felt cost—Mira becomes "the light itself" without dramatized resistance or trade-off. Backstory (daughter, husband) is told in a single retrospective block without anchoring in present micro-choices that shift tactics. The shadow-detachment frame offers potential for internal conflict but remains ornamental rather than forcing contradictory impulses to act in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Amara's motivation is present—hunting quantum residue of lost potential—but her interior life flattens into concept rather than embodied contradiction. The leap from grief to "mathematics of loss" feels more like authorial thesis than a character wrestling with trauma. Micro-choices are absent; she proceeds through her plan without visible hesitation or trade-off, and the final act (downloading coordinates, fleeing) lacks any moment where competing impulses collide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to decode his grandmother's work is clear, but his interior life remains abstract—"perpetually surprised expression" is mentioned as congenital yet never constrains a choice or complicates action. The pilgrim is referenced but never appears, creating a phantom pressure that dissipates. Embodied emotion is scarce; the climactic insertion and resulting "frequencies…in his teeth and sternum" tell rather than dramatize the sensation of belonging, and the final acceptance arrives without visible internal cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his backstory is efficiently woven through present action (examining the watch, arranging carvings). The interiority leans toward philosophical summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"tempered regret settling into his bones" tells more than it dramatizes. The final choice to find the daughter tomorrow is stated as intention rather than enacted with visible cost on the page. Emotional embodiment remains cerebral; the watch "somehow accusing" and sitting "under the weight of unspoken words" trend abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The negotiator demonstrates clear professional competence and a defined hierarchy of values (peace over retribution), but her interior life remains largely abstract. The gesture of giving the drawer pull to the scout suggests complexity, yet the moment reads more as symbolic transfer than embodied choice under conflicting pressures. The "uncommonly thoughtful" trait is asserted but not dramatized through internal contradiction or visible tradeoff. Emotional states are present but filtered through elevated diction rather than visceral particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—guilt-driven self-punishment seeking terrestrial grounding after catastrophic failure—and his contradictory impulses (drawn to water that destroyed him, humming while melancholic) act simultaneously. The embodied grief is strong ("compass…heavy in his pocket," "weight in his chest"), though some interiority veers toward abstraction ("align heart and action at last"). The final renunciation (setting down the compass, refusing the stars) feels earned by prior causality with visible cost, but the extended reflection flattens some immediacy in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to kindle empathy is concrete and drives the descent, but her interior experience leans heavily on abstraction ("hollow ache where empathy should have bloomed") rather than embodied contradiction. The "trigger finger twitching" and weeping at the lake provide physical grounding, yet the emotional progression from cold efficiency to tears feels compressed—the labyrinth's tableau failures are told more than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final stance is earned by the journey's cumulative pressure, though the shift lacks the messy irrationality that would elevate it to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to reach her sister is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The metamorphosis is told through elevated description ("her edges dissolving") without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. The line "I don't want to lose myself" arrives as a single declaration rather than a dramatized tension between reluctance and devotion that plays out in gesture or hesitation across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is densely rendered with embodied emotion (the crack biting skin, breath forming crystals), and her journey from resentment to acceptance shows contradictory impulses. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("unfastening the lock," "releasing birds made of clockwork") rather than concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final shift to acceptance feels somewhat told through symbolic action rather than dramatized through a visible decision with immediate cost. The "willingly perplexed" stance appears more as a declared trait than a constraint that forces error or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is given clear motivation (guilt, helplessness transformed through shadow integration) and the arc moves from suppressed violence to acceptance. Internal contradiction appears—pacifism hiding rage—and the embodied lightness motif tracks his emotional state. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract psychological concepts ("shadow work," "integration," "emotional density") rather than concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final act of stitching feels more symbolic ritual than a decision with visible tradeoff; we see the method but not genuine hesitation or cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "understand the texture of transformation" appears repeatedly but his interior lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he moves through the piece in smooth philosophical acceptance rather than wrestling with genuine ambivalence. The "destitute philanthropist" trait remains abstract label-speak; we're told he orchestrated coincidences and funded bridges, but no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of competing values with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin: "Elias smiled" at the end feels performed rather than emerging from bodily contradiction under pressure. The renunciation of wealth is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized as an earned endurance that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is assigned a clear role ("vigilant lock sentinel") and goal (spark revolution), but interiority remains thin and declarative. The piece tells us she is "calmly inventive" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure. Her actions proceed smoothly without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values or visible cost—no hesitation, error, or trade-off charges the final image. The protagonist reads as competent executor of a plan rather than a character making difficult decisions that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The herder's motivation is signaled early and holds through the ending—deciphering sacred patterns under a binding promise. Interior access is mostly consistent, though the precognitive curse remains label-like; we see visions mentioned but little embodied cost or contradictory impulse until the final dispersal. The closing choice to "become the pattern" feels thematically motivated but arrives without visible struggle or micro-hesitation on the page, reducing earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is densely rendered through metaphor and embodied gesture (the fogging breath, the timer's mechanical heart), and her motivation to understand inherited silence drives the vigil. However, the character work tilts heavily toward reflection and symbolic pattern rather than contradictory impulses acting in real time. The final descent feels like the completion of a ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost, which keeps the score below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aldric's mechanical arm and philosophical stakes are established, but his interiority remains abstract—motivations are told through metaphor ("questions into destinations") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The fencing itself reads as choreography without embodied emotion; when Silas attacks "diplomatically fierce," the phrase labels rather than shows physical urgency. The final truce feels unmotivated by prior causality: no on-page struggle between competing desires forces the choice to collaborate. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("dignity in disguise," "certainty that some overtures must be fought for") flattens the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's monthly personality molting is declared but never constrains an on-page choice—he works smoothly as "the vagrant penny poet" without visible friction from the approaching transformation. Marcus remains functional but one-note, existing to receive the tin and offer thematic agreement. Interiority leans heavily on abstract claims ("felt like armor," "straining against the transformation") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, and the final exchange resolves into mutual affirmation without cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is textured through musical and technical choices, and her "strategically creative" repurposing of grief into navigation provides a coherent through-line. The motivation to decode Maya's film and redirect the station is consistent and embodied in the piano modifications and projector alignment. However, the emotional arc remains somewhat abstract—grief is declared "steely longing" but not contradictory or messy in the moment; the final "tempered into something like peace" reads as summary rather than earned struggle. The protagonist's actions are competent throughout with little visible cost or mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's role as reality checker is established but her interiority reads as label-heavy exposition rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The "luminous doubt" is declared repeatedly but never dramatized through embodied hesitation or competing micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her motivation to protect cultural memory remains abstract—we're told about three lost villages but never see her wrestle with the personal cost of failure or success. The final choice to sing feels inevitable rather than earned by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is well-developed through her relationship with the bonsai and her processing of loss, with embodied moments like holding the lace against the horizon. However, the central epiphany about pruning "for release" arrives somewhat declaratively rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The emotional progression feels authentic in its oscillation between avoidance and engagement, though the final stance crystallizes without visible cost—she simply gains "courage to sail" the tides. Micro-choices like following the compass and wrapping the lace around her wrist show agency, but the severance backstory remains abstract enough that Mara's specific motivations lack the sharp particularity needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistently embodied; her shift from cosmic to microscopic attention is earned through concrete micro-choices (kneeling, watching, cataloging) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final rewiring of her neural pathways is a credible endurance with visible cost, stemming directly from her trait of preprocessing reality. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and filtered through her scientific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal contradiction (despair vs. seeking purpose) is embodied in concrete micro-choices (tracing the ledger, following frost patterns). Her final shift from debt to devotion is earned by the cave discovery, with visible cost in the lost studio and transformed understanding. No label-speak or stock epiphanies; emotional progression feels authentic and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final reconciliation is earned by prior causality and visible cost of deafness and trauma. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marian's weary stubbornness is embodied in micro-choices like resisting the summons and cradling the lens; her motivation to give "rest a permanent address" intensifies under pressure and earns the final transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through concrete actions (touch of the bell, steady pace). Her final choice to ring the bell and declare is earned by the girl's appearance and the accumulated success of the runs, with visible cost (loss of protective anonymity). Interiority is specific and character-particular, though internal contradiction is not deeply explored—acceptable for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya's motivation is clear and embodied; her spiritual curiosity and trembling contradiction drive the scene. The final dissolution is earned by prior causality with visible cost—her collapse and the release of stored love. No slips in characterization touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interiority leans abstract with limited embodied emotion; final choice to merge with the maze is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, but the absence of on-page internal contradiction or contradictory impulses under pressure prevents the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt and synesthesia, with embodied interiority. The final endurance is earned, though contradictory impulses are more backstory than in-scene tension, slightly limiting the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, poetic desire that elevates her beyond a simple thief. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, exemplified in lines like "her heart pressing against her ribs like a fist trying to reach through flesh." Her final act of listening to the portrait is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values—the yearning for destiny over material gain—with a visible cost of perpetual waiting. The contradictory impulses of belief and disbelief act simultaneously in the closure scene, earning her Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Character's contemplative nature and dramatic self-narration are embodied through specific, consistent micro-choices. Her decision to leave is earned by the thaw's pressure, with visible cost in abandoning the sanctuary and spheres. Interiority is concrete (e.g., thumb tracing the bookmark) without stock phrasing, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kai's interior contradiction (phobias as adaptive mechanisms vs. father's dismissal) is concrete and drives micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—embracing vulnerability as power—is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the confrontation. Minor deduction for a slight over-articulation of the epiphany in the final paragraph, but the embodied emotion under stress remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oracle's obsession is concretely embodied in actions and perceptions, driving the ritual with visible cost as she becomes the map. However, the single-minded focus limits internal contradiction, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong interiority for a non-human POV, with clear micro-choices (touching the violin, playing it) that escalate under pressure. The final renunciation (sweeping again but carrying the answer) is earned by the looped realizations. Slight abstraction in emotional embodiment prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses (loyalty vs. honesty) act in scene; her final choice to confront Julian and commit to transparency is earned by prior causality (discovery of tickets, prior complicity) with visible cost (“structures only stand when inspected in full light”). Embodied interiority (“sat heavy in her chest”) and micro-choices (extending tickets as offering) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation—to prove gardens know their gardeners through negotiated truth—is clear, rooted in her pragmatic wisdom, and intensifies as she moves through her ritual. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (the marbles warm against her ribs, her "methodical patience"), and her final action (placing the final marble) is an earned culmination of her established philosophy. The closure choice forecloses a path of mere survival, integrating the cost of maintaining necessary lies.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. However, lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher band. Final choice is earned with visible cost in validation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in artistic compulsion and dreams, and intensifies credibly. Interiority is concrete ("traced the water-damaged images with her fingertip"). The final choice to play the melody is earned, but some emotional description leans toward poetic abstraction rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure (smudging the illustration, taping it centrally) revealing her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of peripheral awareness is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her auroral sorrow. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in trembling fingers and cold glass.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's interior contradiction—skeptical yet compelled to measure an intangible truth—is concrete and embodied in her micro-choices (adjusting the radio, counting beads). Her final realization ("the exact tonnage Elias had confessed") is earned by the causal journey, a renunciation of easy narratives with visible cost. Elias remains off-page, so relationship dynamics are not evaluated, but Mara's solo stance is fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, and interiority is conveyed through poetic perception, but the character functions primarily as a thematic vessel.

His final choice is earned by prior causality, but the character lacks significant internal contradiction or a visible personal cost; the stakes are cosmic, not intimately flawed. This limits the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s "sensibly eccentric" characterization is concrete and drives the narrative. Her motivation to find "where explanations fail" is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies under pressure, compelling her descent and culminating in an earned renunciation (witnessing over explaining).

Interiority is specific and embodied, as seen in "she felt the seductive pull of false comfort" leading to an active renunciation.

A slight deduction for a moment of elevated abstraction ("neural architectures of remembrance") that briefly distances from embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's characterization is deeply embodied; his micro-choice to place the wax under his tongue is a credible, high-stakes action earned by decades of established ritual and the specific, contradictory impulses shown in the scene (e.g., his fluency in dead languages vs. an unknown phrase).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's synesthetic condition and motivation are concrete and embodied, driving her choices with clear stakes. However, internal contradiction is minimal; her determination is singular, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate to the highest band. The final endurance (collapse) is earned and carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "teeth ache," "trembling precision"). Her final choice—transforming penance into restoration—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot; her micro-choices (deliberate ambiguity, shifting personalities) reveal a consistent, manipulative character. The cartographer's disorientation is embodied, but Elara's internal contradictions are not deeply explored, keeping the score from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses (efficiency vs. wonder) act in scene, and his final choice to extend encounters is earned by Maren’s teaching and the pendant’s vibration. The change from jittery to steady is credible, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“adjusted his gloves for the seventh time”). The archivist applies secondary pressure, but Elias’s micro-choice under pressure reveals a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority shown through precise observations and micro-choices. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict, which limits depth and prevents a 9+ score. Her steadfast pursuit feels earned but singular.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya's motivation is clear, deep, and compels her escalating sacrifice. Interiority is rich but occasionally abstract ("wistful," "translucent and terrible"); the final choice to unravel herself is earned by the loom's revealed demand, with cost felt in her transparency. However, her emotional state in middle beats is sometimes described via ornate metaphor rather than visceral, contradictory impulses acted out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's characterization is consistent and well-embodied; her meekness and quiet determination are shown through specific actions (trembling fingers, unwavering shoulders) and drive her choices. The final transformation into a "quiet architect of return" is earned by her on-page struggles and trade-offs. A slight deduction for the "suspended between understanding and confusion" phrase, which edges toward abstract summary in an otherwise concrete interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and drives the narrative; her final renunciation (mapping the silence instead of redirecting) is earned by the accumulative discovery of her mentor's secret, with visible cost in the weight she carries forward.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied, driving his actions with concrete interiority. However, the lack of internal contradiction or conflicting impulses limits the depth of characterization under pressure, though the final choice is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)

Her motivation—to understand her donor's gravitational pull on stories—intensifies credibly, culminating in a micro-choice (releasing the wing) that reveals a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by the preceding reflective beats, with a visible cost in the scar-tissue pulse. Contradictory impulses of caution and wonder act simultaneously, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consuming, embodied through her lunar healing and discovery-driven actions. However, the absence of on-page contradictory impulses or internal conflict during key beats prevents the highest band, though her final choice is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are limited; Elara's choice is plot-driven rather than deeply conflicted, though earned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—compassion vs. reclusion—act simultaneously in scene, embodied in micro-choices like placing the invitation and retreating. His final resolution to "stay while leaving" is earned by prior causality (his own mistaken invitation) with visible cost (solitude maintained). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is concretely embodied in her observations and guerrilla gardening; her internal drive to find the sacred in the ordinary anchors consistent micro-choices, culminating in the decision to uncloak her project. The final choice to share the bread pudding is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fragility of the garden and memory. Minor deduction for a lack of contradictory impulses in scene, but her steadfast gentleness is character-specific and pressures the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her interiority is concrete and her final realization is earned by her meticulous actions.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in loyalty to her father, compelling her to risk capture. Interiority is concrete via sensory connection to the fob and memories, and her micro-choices under pressure (false starts, feigning drunkenness) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance/renunciation (escaping with evidence) is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the tense, risky close. Minor deduction for some backstory summary, but it anchors present action and tilts stance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied (pulsing skin, taste changes) and drives her journey; her transformation into the emergent compass is earned through convergence and forest election.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's mnemonic gift and artistic yearning are concretely embodied, driving her from trapped performer to pioneer.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied through her aged, stiff fingers and her acute perception of vibration. Her motivation—to preserve the color of wonder—is the consistent, driving force that compels her final, decisive action of releasing the brake. The seasonal muteness is a flaw that actively enables her precision, creating a credible endurance with a felt cost. However, her internal contradiction under pressure is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael-9's nostalgia and inner static are concretely embodied, and the final choice to burn the roses is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values (preservation vs. survival). The shift from paralyzing memory to foundational strength is earned, with visible cost in the burned rows. However, the android's emotional processing occasionally trends toward abstract labeling ("inner static," "fragmented wholeness"), which slightly limits the visceral punch of the contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya's motivation is clear and demonstrated through concrete actions; her "leads through following" attribute shapes key choices. Mr. Alvarez's grief is embodied and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is concrete and earned; Maya's desire to learn the building's language drives credible choices, and her final act of bringing her own seal is motivated by prior lessons. The revelation of Elias's death is stated rather than dramatized, a minor slip that doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's interior contradiction (skepticism vs. undeniable magic, belief in solitude vs. dawning connection) is concrete and acts simultaneously. Her final choice to carry burdens without being consumed is earned by the memory's vision and the pressure of the dawn deadline, with visible cost in the transformed garden and her shifted resolve. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of her final realization ("vessel that remained distinct from its contents") which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her internal conflict and embodied emotions (e.g., trembling hands, use of blood) drive micro-choices under pressure, earning the final renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her "richly perceptive" trait, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., "ached with the weight").

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" is clear, rooted in her profession, and intensifies under the ghost's pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., her analysis of dream patterns as "windows of connection"). The final choice to write the truth is an earned endurance/renunciation foreclosing other paths. A minor deduction for the slightly label-like repetition of "weaves truth carefully," which edges toward diagnostic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kaelen's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her philosophy; her final satisfaction is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)

However, the settlers themselves are somewhat one-dimensional, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete traits; his loneliness and variant allegiance are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting dials, projecting shadows). However, interior contradiction is minimal—he is steadfast, not torn—which limits the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's characterization is concrete and compelling. His motivation is clear, rooted in regret and the singular goal of bridging the silence with his daughter. Interiority is rich and particular (e.g., "wept with a positively wistful joy that stung like honey"), and his final choice to leave is earned by the climactic composition, a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for the minor, slightly forced phrasing of "positively wistful joy," which edges toward label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's logical-emotional duality is concretely dramatized through her logarithmic calculation infused with memory, and her final choice to sing is earned by her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation and interiority are concrete, with embodied emotion ("the wildness inside her stretch and settle") and micro-choices under pressure (leading the crossing without hurrying). The final choice is earned by years of patient preparation, with cost legible in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s interior contradiction between empirical discipline and emotional recognition is embodied in concrete micro-choices (deliberate breaths, trembling hands). Her final decision to use his methods for her own moral judgment is earned by the cascade of memories and evidence, with visible cost in the weight of the lantern and her resolve.

Minor abstraction in “fortified vulnerability” is immediately grounded in physical action, not harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's guilt and redemption are concretely embodied; his shift from burden to purpose is earned by the discovery. The repairman is functional but slightly archetypal, limiting depth, but the quick test is met with contradictory impulses and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through her handling of the burned letter and observations of the vineyard. Her final choice (acceptance, not waiting) is earned by the causal chain of her reflective "rediscovery." Contradictory impulses—rootedness vs. the pull of Marcus's philosophy—act simultaneously in the scene. The only minor slip is a slight leaning toward diagnostic label-speak ("intersubjective understanding"), but it is quickly grounded in concrete metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line walker's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but interiority is limited; we see little internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, which keeps the score from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation (preservation, decoding) is clear and rooted in her scholarly, observant nature. Her interiority is conveyed through concrete sensory perception (crystal warming, watching lichen) rather than abstract labels. The final choice—to testify through placement, not voice—is a credible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, foreclosing her old path of rigid decoding and accepting a new role. A slight deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("weathered innocence") that momentarily distances embodied immediacy, but the core arc is earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character is vividly realized with embodied emotion and a clear, doomed motivation. The cycle of forgetting and longing is embodied in micro-choices (chalk, markers). The final stasis is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is singular and compelling, with her patience physically demonstrated in contrast to her explosive craft.

His method of writing obituaries for the living, his tactile use of the thread, and his final micro-choice to tie it as a bracelet are all micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian's motivation is singular, concrete, and drives the entire narrative; interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in lines like "the bitterly sweet weight of possibility that now threatened to crush his ribs." His final choice and emotional state are earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for occasional over-articulated interiority that edges toward diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "hypothesizing about everything... the emotional state of the last living mother bird"), which reduces raw immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya's characterization is deeply textured, with embodied contradictions (firefighter/arsonist's daughter) driving a credible, cost-heavy choice.

    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, embodied in specific actions like turning the gear and pressing it into the nebula's heart. Her internal realization—understanding the gear as a lantern—is earned through the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, with interiority rendered through concrete, embodied actions (powdering charcoal, assembling the mask).

    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness and desire to preserve wonder are concrete, driving his secret actions and the climactic revelation. His micro-choices under pressure (handing over the matchbox, explaining) reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

A slight deduction for the engineer’s reaction being somewhat summarized rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)

    Motivation is intense and clear, embodied in concrete action and perception ("the music of the waves made sleep impossible and creation inevitable"). Interiority is character-particular but lacks layered contradiction; the final endurance (restless euphony) is earned, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's quietly driven nature is embodied through her meticulous actions and internal conflict, culminating in an earned choice between mapping and participation with visible cost in the final question.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession; interiority is concrete and embodied, with a final choice earned by prior causality and visible cost ("Each step echoed with the weight of her responsibility"). The emotionally rational trait is demonstrated, not just labeled, though the decision path is slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's stoic sensitivity is embodied in concrete micro-choices; her motivation to preserve abandoned dreams drives every action, and the final endurance carries visible cost in her shivering and hushed blaze, earning the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving logical investigation. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, though peak emotional embodiment is slightly restrained. The final choice to overhaul the catalog is earned by prior causality with visible cost (months of work). The "logical page indexer" trait is integrated into action, not just label.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira's motivation to transform grief is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; her internal conflict of descending/ascending is rendered through concrete micro-choices. The final release of cranes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her dissolution. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains character-particular and under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Amara's grief-driven hunt is concretely embodied in trembling fingers and bleak exhilaration; her final choice to descend for quantum residue is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the fractured geode. Contradictory impulses—seeking confirmation, not revenge—act in scene, and micro-choices under time pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, with interiority shown through embodied details (trembling fingers, straining shoulders). The final shift from surprised to belonging is earned by the ritual, though the "perpetually surprised" trait remains slightly underutilized as an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's guilt is embodied in raw hands and trembling fingers; his motivation to measure the weight of his crime drives every beat, and the final choice to bear witness is earned by the accumulative discovery of carvings. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular. The resolution—Charged Poise—forecloses his detached past with visible cost ("tempered regret settling into his bones").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The negotiator's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure (rotating the drawer pull, unlocking shackles, gifting the object) reveal a consistent, thoughtful character motivated by recycling past failures. However, the portrayal lacks significant internal contradiction or emotional degradation in the moment, leaning toward composed control rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is a deeply realized character with contradictory impulses (merrily melancholic) shown in scene. His final renunciation of the compass is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara's interior conflict and transformation are concretely embodied; her motivation compels high-stakes choices, and the final weeping is earned with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied conflict; her reluctant metamorphosis is earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page. The final choice to become a bridge is driven by contradictory impulses—steadfast devotion versus fear of loss—shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, built through contradictory impulses (seeking time yet surrendering) and embodied, non-diagnostic emotion ("a physical weight that ached with sweetness"). Her final renunciation—accepting transformation over reclamation—is earned by the on-page struggle with the Nine of Shadows card and the act of tracing her daughter's future hands. The micro-choice to leave the saucer demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interior contradiction and transformation are embodied and earned. His pacifism, once a denial, becomes an embrace of internal violence through decades of solitude, culminating in a final choice that forecloses his existence with visible cost ("weightless with compassion").

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with his motivation to understand transformation driving micro-choices; his final renunciation is earned by prior causality, and cost is legible in his destitution and acceptance of ash.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in years of preparation; interiority is concrete through sensory actions and micro-choices. The final renunciation (completing the sundial) is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal, she remains steadily competent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a decades-old promise and a curse. Interiority is concrete (visions "burning like collapsed star dust"), and his final choice to step into the field is earned by prior causality. However, the emotional cost of his dispersal is more conceptual than viscerally embodied, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("furiously tranquil resolve"), and her final choice to write and leave the manuscript is earned by the discovery of the negative and the realization of her father's parallel vigil. The cost of her silence and the risk of continuing are felt. Her motivation as a censored poet drives every beat, and her emotional progression from silence to storm-kissed wonder is embodied and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aldric's mechanical arm and philosophical drive are concretely embodied, and his final choice to collaborate with Silas is earned through the duel's pressure. Silas is less developed but serves as a credible foil. The lack of strong contradictory impulses in Aldric's interiority prevents a higher score, though micro-choices under pressure are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's molting condition creates urgent interior conflict; his final choice to reveal the tin's contents is earned by prior causality with visible cost (risk of identity loss). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure solidify characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena's motivation (grief repurposed as navigation) is clear, concrete, and intensifies under pressure. Interiority is embodied ("steely longing," "precision of desperate hope") and her final transformation to "something like peace" is earned by on-page actions. The "strategically creative" trait is demonstrated through modifying the piano and decoding the film, driving key choices. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible and rooted in loss.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied doubt, and her final acceptance of luminous doubt is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (following the compass, pruning for release) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from avoidance to acceptance is earned by prior causality, and the cost—the ache of healing wounds—is visible on the page. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific, sensory perception.


== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation and worldview are sharply drawn—the neutron-star researcher seeking “quiet math beneath catastrophe” is specific and convincing, and her shift toward the greenhouse as observatory feels earned. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, filtered through scientific metaphors rather than generic emotion words. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (old identity vs new stance) remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see much embodied ambivalence or cost beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific—her training with glass convincingly informs how she reads frost and terrain, and the suicide attempt plus burned studio give her clear, credible pressure. Her motivation to understand her father’s debts and rebuild her life is coherent and consistent. The main weakness is that her final reorientation toward life and art feels slightly swift and tidy for the depth of trauma implied, with a touch of therapy-language abstraction in “discover purpose in the pauses.” Still, her micro-choices (walking, reading, deciding to work again differently) arise naturally from what we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific—her grief, envy, hope, and anger are embodied through color, temperature, and bodily sensation, not just labels. Her core motive (to “rectify the trauma” and reconfigure silence) is clear and consistently drives her choices with a credible emotional history in the shipwreck. The final acceptance of silence as instrument rather than prison reads earned by the accumulation of prior beats and the long apprenticeship implied. The main limitation is that internal conflict is more layered texture than active contradiction; we see less of her resisting this transformation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marian’s vocation, weariness, and core motive (“to give rest a permanent address”) are vivid and specific, and her inadvertent stubbornness ties cleanly into the thematic architecture. Her resistance to the summons has credible roots in her values, and her eventual acceptance of the task reads as earned rather than convenient. The internal contradiction—soil-bound dignity vs. answering the oceanic call—is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in real-time decisions, which slightly softens the sense of struggle. Still, for this length, she feels particular, embodied, and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation—protecting communal dignity and survival under sanctions—is clear and consistent, and her anonymity vs. visibility dilemma is well-seeded then turned by the girl’s appearance. Interiority is specific enough (“amplified quiet,” her attention to the bell and to Tiber’s breathing) to individualize her, though her internal conflict could be more thickly dramatized at the exact decision to ring the bell. The choice to relinquish anonymity and leadership at the end feels earned by prior behavior, with a visible cost in risk and loss of secrecy. Secondary figures remain sketched but functional rather than vivid personalities.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation—to locate and release “unused love” tied to her own past life—is vivid, specific, and drives every choice from setting up the camera to pressing the crystal into the stone. Her interiority is concrete (breath patterns, physical trembling, sensory focus) and particular rather than generic mysticism. The tension between observer (camera obscura artist) and participatory pilgrim culminates in her collapse and dissolution into the scene, which feels earned. The only minor limitation is that contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in direct on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover and map the “texture of time”—is clear and consistent, and his final renunciation of a separate self by becoming the maze is earned by the prior obsession with geometry and memory. However, interiority stays largely conceptual and descriptive rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses or emotional struggle in scene. He accepts disintegration almost too smoothly; we don’t feel much fear, reluctance, or competing desire. The result is an elegant but slightly emotionally cool transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive as a voluntary, long-term guardian is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (accepting the chain, prioritizing preservation over freedom and violence) track well under pressure. Her embodied cost is present in the worn circle of concrete and the 17-year wait, but her interior conflict is muted—there’s little sense of contradictory impulses in the climax. The scavenger remains thinly sketched, functioning more as a moral audience than a full counterforce. The final endurance choice feels earned but emotionally could dig one layer deeper into her doubts or fear to hit elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation is vivid and specific—atonement via an impossible acoustic experiment—and her bodily limit (deteriorating marrow) gives her interiority weight. The guilt over the betrayed child is strong material, though the conflict between scientific obsession and remorse is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in present-moment micro-choices. Her choices (continuing the work, fitting the device into her own ear) align cleanly with her motives and produce a credible Earned Stasis at the end. The lack of any on-page secondary character keeps relational pressure hypothetical rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—stealing “illuminated moments” and listening for destiny—is vivid and specific, and her competence with flowers and timing feels earned. Interiority is textured and embodied (“heart pressing against her ribs like a fist…”), and her worldview is distinct. The main limitation is that she doesn’t truly shift; the ending reinforces her stance rather than complicating it with a visible new cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glassblower’s temperament, worldview, and coping strategies are vivid and particular, especially her ritualistic narration of mundane tasks and her reverence for transformation. Her motivation—to create “safe zones for inquiry” and to transmute isolation into sanctuary—is clear and consistent. Internal conflict (abandoning the world below yet still serving future researchers; needing to leave the station she loves) is present but stays relatively low-temperature and mostly conceptual. A slightly sharper dramatization of her ambivalence at the moment of departure would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kai’s characterization is rich and specific: the phobias, stunt training, and discovery of being a “replacement” cohere into a distinctive psychology under pressure. Motivation (reclaim autonomy, expose father) is clear and drives concrete choices like decrypting the cast and engineering the confrontation. The use of fear as both limitation and tool is strong, though interior conflict is sometimes summarized in analytic language (“firmly adaptive survival mechanisms”) rather than dramatized moment-to-moment contradiction. The final stance—neither original Kai nor obedient double—feels earned from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oracle’s motivation and worldview are sharply defined—her belief that “noise was merely a distraction” cleanly underpins every action. Her obsession feels integrated (seventeen years of measuring silences, mapping them as coordinates), and the final endurance—accepting endless night and becoming the map—is an earned stasis. What’s missing at elite level is more contradictory impulse or emotional friction; she rarely feels torn, which slightly flattens her under pressure. The cost of self-erasure is implied but not deeply felt from the inside.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    Seven’s interiority and arc from “janitor under punishment” to “seeker of thought-origins” are coherent and specific, with the violin encounter clearly reorienting its motives. However, emotional life remains heavily abstracted into conceptual language, so we seldom feel concrete, character-particular conflict (e.g., fear of failure vs. attraction to the violin) in embodied terms. The “remarkably composed” trait flattens potential volatility, reducing visible struggle at peaks. The final realization is motivated by prior beats but passes quickly into theme-speak rather than dramatized inner contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s interiority, guilt, and urge toward transparency feel grounded and specific, and her small but consequential choices (examining the tickets, confronting Julian, deciding to confess and file the report) are well-motivated. The relationship dynamic with Julian is nuanced, shifting from suspicion to a fragile mutual honesty that doesn’t erase harm. Contradictory impulses—her complicity versus her need to clear the air—are present, though they could be dramatized with slightly more embodied struggle at the confrontation itself. Overall, the arc from silent registrar to active truth-teller reads earned and character-led.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s role, worldview, and long-term project are sharply etched, and her motives for lying and mending are coherent and specific. However, she remains largely in a stable, priestly mode; we don’t see much in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine wobble under pressure in the present scene. Her emotional life is mostly inferred from ritual precision rather than dramatized conflict or embodied feeling. The endurance at the end feels earned but low-cost, more mantra than hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s intellectual drive and steady competence are clearly established, and his choice to run the experiment against prior dismissal is well motivated. However, his emotional range is narrow—primarily calm focus and quiet vindication—with little contradictory impulse or real doubt under pressure. Dr. Vex provides a minimal but functional relational crucible by shifting from skepticism to recognition, yet that dynamic is underused. The final “earned” smile feels credible but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to respond to the ghostly code and resolve the theater’s stasis—is clear and rooted in her artistic sensibility, and her choices (arriving early, arranging lanterns, choosing to play an unwritten melody) track cleanly. Interiority is particular (the “texture” of silence, the way she reads water damage as language) rather than generic. However, she never faces a genuine dilemma or contradictory impulse; the story gives her almost no friction or real emotional cost for engaging, so her final “change” feels more like fulfilling a role than making a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in her professional identity as a “fault-tolerant oracle,” with her flaw (rounding toward hope, hiding in margins) credibly driving both past errors and present guilt. Her embodied weakness post-fever and tactile interactions with the illustration and glass keep emotions concrete. The final choice—to tape the smudged illustration at the center of the log—is an earned renunciation of her old coping strategy with a visible psychic cost. The only small limitation is that a few insights (“weight of complicity”) sit close to abstract statement rather than fully dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is sharply drawn: her history of reckless mill exploration, methodological skepticism, and need to “measure” moral weight all align with her present choices. Her interiority is embodied and particular (tuning the radio, counting bead colors, tracing metal) rather than abstract labels. The internal conflict between architectural thrill-seeking and the ethics of witness is credible and culminates in her accepting the role of “scale upon which such truths were weighed.” Elias, though off-page, feels psychologically real through the consequences of his confession on her.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    The chronicle keeper has a clear, consistent motivation and a specific way of perceiving the world, and her choices (seeking the refuge, then choosing to return) align with that. Interiority is textured and character-particular, especially her belief that “gripping reality loosely is the only way to hold it at all.” However, internal contradiction under pressure is minimal—she rarely feels genuinely torn between impulses, so the arc reads more as confirmation than struggle. The final choice to carry the silence back costs her little on the page, so the change feels more contemplative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is rich, specific, and embodied through her methods (matching patients’ breathing, using the locket, timing the session), and Milo’s silence and gradual engagement track credibly. Her core drive (“to nurture lifelong wonder”) is clear and actions align with it across the piece. The relationship dynamic—her as “bridge rather than push”—is sharply drawn and governs each micro-choice. Some motivation and insight are told a bit baldly (“Her motivation remained constant…”) rather than fully dramatized, which slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to extract and preserve stories from walls in a post-dream world—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices (probing the fireplace, working through the night, reading aloud at the end). Her emotional life is embodied in concrete actions and images (tears on the dragon’s wing, ash-stained fingers) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is quieter: she feels both professional hunger and personal grief, but this tension never sharpens into a difficult, value-testing choice. The ending offers a deepened understanding more than a true character turn, which keeps the arc short of fully transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply etched: his eccentric vocation, isolation, and naive belief he’s “modulating his existence” form a coherent, particular psychology. The accidentally-prophetic blind spot creates strong irony, especially in lines like “He didn’t know he was an open secret…”. However, his internal conflict is more told than dramatized; he rarely hesitates or struggles on the page, which softens the cost of his final shift. A bit more embodied ambivalence around leaving the island would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elian’s motivation—to protect the sanctuary by interrogating assumptions—is clear and consistently tied to his identity as a ritual rhetorician. His choices (using the loop pedal, deploying specific rhetorical devices, tracing the anchor line) are coherent and goal-driven. However, his interiority remains largely conceptual rather than embodied; we rarely feel physical stress, fear, or contradictory impulses under time pressure. The entity functions mainly as a foil for ideas, not a psychologically rich opponent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific—his history as a fortune writer, his obsession with silence and music, and his temporal dislocation all feel particular. Motivation (to decode his past and assemble it into a coherent “symphony”) is clear and consistent. What’s missing is a sharper felt contradiction or cost on the page; exhaustion is gestured at but never really pressures his choices, and his final shift away from homesickness comes a bit too smoothly. The piece earns a meaningful reconfiguration, but not a hard, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to navigate and integrate her own splintered timelines—is clear, consistent, and tied to specific objects (the tablet, the viaduct) and constraints (procedural generation, periodic eternity). However, her internal conflict is more declared than dramatized; we’re told of “a thousand deaths and lives” and her dread of the cycle, but very few concrete, scene-level contradictions or micro-choices under pressure appear. The final acceptance of her “periodically eternal” nature reads earned in concept but emotionally rapid given the short on-page struggle. Still, the character feels particular rather than generic and her final stance shifts in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—paralysis after deafness and fear of feeling—is clear and consistently dramatized through her reluctance and then surrender to sensation. Interiority is specific and embodied (stone gloves, tears only now arriving), with a believable before/after in her willingness to teach again. The relationship with Mathew adds quiet but effective pressure without stealing focus. The only limitation is a slight tendency toward abstract labels (“emotional numbness”) where even more behavior-level contradiction under pressure could sharpen her.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara is sharply rendered: her occupational mindset (“storm recorder”) shapes every perception and choice, and her solitude-as-architecture-for-truth gives her a distinctive inner life. Micro-choices—counting to thirty, moving laterally, opening the window to unsanctioned rain—align with this psychology. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; she moves from caution to commitment with little visible wavering, which slightly softens the sense of struggle. Still, the final stance (embracing a dangerous dual ledger) feels earned by the prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief, routine, and obsessive curiosity about scent are clearly grounded in his role and history, and his final choice to open the vial and “open his lungs” feels earned. The internal contradiction between cautious avoidance and longing for understanding is present and resolved on the page. Some phrasing (“unprocessed grief,” “core of his existence had narrowed”) edges toward abstract/diagnostic rather than fully dramatized, slightly flattening the emotional texture. Overall, his arc from numb maintenance to active grieving is psychologically coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s motivation (to discover the texture of time and confront his lover/future dilemma) is clear and consistent, and his “ethically playful” temperament shows in his refusal of the binary choice. Interiority is vivid and particular, though skewed more toward philosophical and sensory perception than concrete, embodied emotional beats about the lover, which keeps the stakes slightly abstract. His final stance—choosing the paradoxical sideways path—feels earned by prior pages. The main limitation is the relative emotional coolness around what he’s sacrificing, which blunts the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s core motivation is clear and consistently embodied in her choices—she seeks “beauty in the unfinished” and plays in a way that honors fragments rather than completion. However, she reads more as a ritual figure or thematic vehicle than a fully conflicted person; we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle under pressure. Her decision “Tonight she would unbind the silence” arrives as a given rather than something wrestled toward, which slightly flattens the interior arc. The endurance at the end (accepting an incomplete, “radiantly undone” world) is thematically apt but emotionally under-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s characterization is vivid and consistent—the “professionally thorough” counterfeit dealer with an underlying drive to bridge knowing and feeling comes through clearly in choices like carefully explaining the limits and then documenting the anomaly. The client’s motive (“I need to feel what I am becoming before I finish becoming it”) is sharp and specific. Internal contradiction in Kael—commerce vs genuine ethical/thematic curiosity—is present but could be dramatized more under pressure rather than mostly stated. The closing stance (“I will be professionally thorough in my experiments until all half truths become whole”) feels earned, if a bit declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—rechanneling his shrewdness toward honoring invisible labor—is clear, consistent, and credibly rooted in the misdirected envelope and his relationship with Clara. His internal conflict between mercantile calculus and emergent compassion is nicely sketched (“merchant's instinct for quantifiable value warring with his newfound urge…”), though rendered more in abstract terms than in embodied, pressured moments. Clara reads more as a catalytic presence than a fully pressured character, which limits relational complexity. The final shift into stewardship feels earned, but the emotional cost of renouncing “ruthless contingency deals” could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s longing for community and compulsion to make art are clear and consistent, culminating credibly in the choice to build and dedicate the bridge. The “boldly sympathetic” trait is dramatized (e.g., weeping when Joss shares their glyph), and their offerings to the group feel like an earned extension of that flaw/virtue. Internal contradiction is present but relatively soft—Kael’s desperation and generosity don’t clash as sharply as they might. Secondary figures are vivid but mostly emblematic, adding texture rather than direct pressure on Kael’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to reach and document the birthplace of echoes using her forbidden talent—is clear and consistently rooted in her role as an illustrator and time-thief. Her guilt and precision (“not with fear, but with the precise burden…”) give her interiority some texture beyond stock awe. However, her internal conflict stays mostly intellectual; we don’t see a sharpened, in-the-moment hesitation or competing value that makes the final choice feel agonizing. The endurance cost at the end (spent pendant, looming debt) is credible but emotionally underplayed, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s grief, persistence, and obsessive “mathematics of emotion” are specific and embodied through his tactile work with the glass eyes and the mosaic, and his final stance shift (carrying the “answer in his chest”) feels earned. The ambiguous loss of his sister clearly motivates his actions throughout. Internal conflict between mourning and hope is present but stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through sharper on-page dilemma or misstep in this scene. The piece could reach a higher band with one more concrete, pressured choice that visibly costs him something in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation—using obsolete media to create a hidden network for the invisible—is specific, consistent, and rooted in her history and temperament. Her kindly, methodical traits are dramatized in how she catalogs and places each fragment. The internal contradiction between staying hidden and wanting to be “visible to those who need you” is present but could be pushed into sharper on-page conflict. The final endurance/stance (remaining hidden while leaving evidence of care) feels earned, though the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s motivation and inner conflict are sharply drawn: her need for control versus her stated aim “to preserve” plants gives the central tension bite. The embodied shift—“roots cracking through concrete, uncomfortable and necessary”—grounds the epiphany in felt experience. Her final decision to dismantle climate controls and rebuild the eastern wing is clearly fore-shadowed by earlier traits and research history, so the change feels earned and costly. The only minor limitation is that everything moves smoothly toward insight with little irrational backsliding or mess, slightly softening psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid—insomniac, obsessive painter, dryly self-aware—and her responses to salt, tides, and the brooch all feel specific to her. The motive for the trade (the mentor’s journals, the need to “thresh meaning”) is clear and consistent. However, internal contradiction is relatively muted; she moves toward the exchange and the closing realization with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage. The relationship with Maren is textured but not deeply pressured, so their dynamic doesn’t quite become a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pride in her predictive competence, followed by the shock and liberation of failing to foresee the pilgrim, gives her a clear, motivated internal arc. Her embodied reactions (“tasting like copper,” the tug of precognition turning to static) feel specific rather than generic. The pilgrim is more archetypal than individuated, but that suits her function as vessel for the cave’s will. The final repricing of clairvoyance as presence over prediction is emotionally credible and earned, though the internal conflict could tighten further under more concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael is sharply etched—his profession, visionary faculty, and quiet ethic are all specific—and his motivation to reconstruct history feels consistent and credible across the piece. The gift’s toll (“staggered intervals of vision and blindness”) hints at internal cost but doesn’t fully develop into a live, conflicted tension or mistake under pressure. His choice to give the valve away is moving and thematically apt, yet it comes very smoothly; there’s little sense of competing impulse or sacrifice beyond mild stiffness from sitting. The old woman is sketched efficiently and non-stereotypically, but the relationship beat, while effective, remains gentle rather than pressureful.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and consistent: the meticulous route mapper whose “analytically artistic” mind recodes cracks, stars, and infrastructure into a readable language feels specific and alive. Her motivation—finding her sister’s silence within the “fortress of unspoken truths”—is clear and coherently tied to her profession and worldview. Internal conflict (fear vs “trembling certainty”) is present but lightly sketched; the decision to board feels more inevitable than agonized, slightly muting visible cost. Still, her micro-choices around analyzing the cracks and handling the punch flow convincingly from her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply drawn as a sympathetic skeptic whose kindness and pragmatism both precede and motivate her shift. Her internal conflict (intellect vs openness to mystery) is clear and resolved through action—finding the tile, enduring the visions, and choosing to redesign the tower. The transformation from detached researcher to “guardian” is a bit swift but causally supported by the intensity of the entangled memories. Emotional embodiment leans abstract at times, but her values and choices remain consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s weariness, loneliness, and obsessive curiosity are clearly motivated and track cleanly from the opening boredom to the final decision to risk another love. However, his inner life leans declarative—there’s limited on-page contradiction or messy ambivalence under peak pressure, so the emotional shift lands more as a clean concept than a fully embodied struggle. His attachment to the amulet and the lost lover is effective but summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening the cost of his final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s characterization is rich and internally consistent: the “mathematically honest mind” vs. her father’s con artistry gives her a specific, credible lens on justice. Her motives—protecting her father, leveraging his secrets, and preserving her own integrity—are clear and in tension. Emotional life, however, skews cerebral and thematic rather than bodily or messily felt, which slightly flattens peak pressure. The father is effective as an off-stage pressure but remains more function than person.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to preserve the textures of time against an encroaching void—is vivid and consistent, and his meticulous craft choices feel rooted in that drive. We get strong, particular interiority through the way he relates to gold, the lamp, and his daughter’s remembered laughter. What’s lighter is live internal contradiction under pressure; his “incandescent restraint” never really frays, even when the lamp stutters, so we don’t see much clash between competing impulses. The final endurance choice is credible but emotionally muted by that relative lack of on-page inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s perceptual and motivational profile is vivid and consistent, and their tactile-auditory synesthesia feels genuinely character-specific. Motivation—to reconstruct a self via textures of other people’s memories—is clear and sustained. However, we get almost no contradictory impulses in scene or micro-choices under pressure; the piece largely asserts their stance rather than dramatizing it through difficult decisions. The “they understood finally” realization is plausible but not clearly earned by on-page struggle or a tested alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core drive (to decode the riddle of what persists after endings and to reach Mara) is clear and coherently tied to her life as a myth buster. Her internal contradiction—skeptic versus yearning believer—is well dramatized in the move from cutting through fantasy to accepting myth. The emotional throughline with Mara is genuinely felt, though her final shift into “becoming a myth” happens a touch too smoothly for maximal impact. More on-page friction or self-resistance at the moment she steps into the fog would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and specific—her dual allegiance, the tactile link to her grandmother via the stone, and her professional role all cohere into a complex, motivated protagonist. Her conflicting impulses (corporate badge vs. tokens, pragmatism vs. loyalty) operate simultaneously and resolve into a clear choice through the graffiti network. Emotional states are embodied (the thrum of generators, the stone’s texture) rather than labeled. The only shortfall is the lack of a direct on-page relational crucible scene with another character applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and specific—she is a last witness trying to preserve a vanishing structure—and her actions align cleanly with that drive. Her professional competence and stubbornness are well rendered in details like mixing reagents in vacuum and refusing to retreat to shelter. What’s missing, slightly, is a stronger sense of internal contradiction or live temptation to give in, which would deepen the emotional cost of her endurance. The final acceptance of her role as an archivist of extinction feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s characterization is rich, specific, and coherent: her tactile/sensory workarounds, professional competence, and guilt-driven motivation all reinforce each other. Her backstory (the shipwreck, loss of sight) is cleanly tethered to present choices, and her final emotional shift from guilt to earned purpose feels motivated. What’s slightly missing for a higher band is a sharper on-page sense of contradictory impulses under peak pressure—she never seriously wavers or missteps. The inner conflict is conceptually strong but enacted in a relatively smooth, assured line.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlow’s profession, temperament, and dry wit are sharply drawn and consistent, and his motivation—to complete the survey and locate the rivers’ source before the thaw—tracks cleanly through to the final transmission. His choices (trusting the condensation method, venturing onto the lake, sending the coordinates) align with that characterization. What’s missing, for top-tier, is a real internal contradiction or felt ambivalence under pressure; he never seems genuinely torn, which limits emotional complexity. The shift to a “reverent” tone at the convergence is convincing but not a deep character reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—restoring balance rather than conquest—and her seventeen years of walking provide a credible cost and persistence. However, she functions more as an archetypal figure than a fully conflicted person; we rarely see contradictory impulses or degraded thought under pressure. Her “infinitely patient” nature is stated more than dramatized in a way that complicates choices. The closing act (placing the fork) feels fully aligned with her established motives, but not newly revealing of her as an individual.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (grief over her sister, professional obligation, and awe-driven curiosity) are clear and consistently drive her choices, culminating in the decisive, motivated act of exhaling and drinking the vial. The internal conflict between survival instinct and surrender is explicit and on-theme, especially where “Her training screamed against what she must do next…”. However, her emotions skew abstract and lofty rather than concretely embodied under stress, so some beats feel more conceptual than viscerally character-specific. The post-mission shift—lying in the report, reconfiguring her grief—reads earned by prior causality, though it lands a touch neatly for this register.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to escape a sentence inherited from his father by weaponizing story instead of confession—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. His interiority around narrative physics, inheritance, and silence feels character-particular rather than generic. However, his emotional life skews cerebral; there’s limited embodied contradiction (fear vs exultation, guilt vs ruthlessness) at the peak escape beats, which keeps the arc from feeling fully harrowing. The choice to kill/allow the deaths in the cellar is under-textualized emotionally, softening the felt cost of his cunning.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eira’s motivation—release from a curse via restitution—is clear, specific, and governs her every choice, and Julian’s abrupt but visceral shift from confusion to inherited guilt feels earned by the bead-triggered memories. The “heal through hurting” line is thematically sharp and dramatized in his painful awakening rather than left abstract. Internal contradiction (her tenderness vs. vengeance, his guilt vs. relief) is present but could be deepened with one or two more concrete, character-particular beats. Julian’s near-instant acceptance of his role works, but an added flicker of resistance or self-protection would sharpen his individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s motivation—to repair the canyon and her people’s relationship to it—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Her embodied engagement with stone, thread, and blood gives her an almost mythic solidity. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; she moves from taboo-breaking resolve to fulfilled ritual with little visible ambivalence or doubt. That relative lack of on-page inner friction keeps this just short of top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to restore faith and reconnect with her ancestors—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to rebuild the sundial instead of merely cataloging remains. Her interiority is vivid and character-particular, filtered through sensory engagement with bone, root, and stone. The final kneeling-in-shadow moment feels like a real internal shift from disconnection to organic prayer. However, we rarely see sharp contradictory impulses in real-time (e.g., terror vs. reverence, doubt vs. devotion) pushing against each other on the page, which keeps the arc slightly too smooth for top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s vocation, worldview, and reverence for analog artifacts are vivid and specific, and their choices (arriving early, experimenting with CRT light, trusting the chalk code) track cleanly with those traits. However, their interiority remains relatively singular—committed, competent, almost serenely aligned with their task—so contradictory impulses under pressure are muted. Emotional embodiment leans more conceptual than visceral. The final acceptance of shared obsolescence is resonant but not sharply costed in terms of personal sacrifice or inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s character is sharply etched through her meticulous craft, social camouflage, and probabilistic thinking; her “foolishness as architecture” line crystallizes her defining contradiction. Her motivation—to protect the empire by reading adjacent possibilities in silence—is consistent and drives all her choices. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we rarely feel fear, doubt, or moral friction on the page, which softens the emotional cost. The captain is sketched efficiently but remains mostly a functional foil rather than a fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rectifying her past cowardice—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, with the final act of entering the hospital room feeling well-earned. Her interior conflict between fear of anticipated grief and the urge to love anyway is dramatized rather than summarized. Emotions are embodied (the shard in her sternum, letters burning against her ribs) and not reduced to labels. If anything, her competence as a medium slightly softens the sense of risk; more visible doubt or potential failure in the climax could heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s worldview and motives are clear, particular, and embodied in her choices: translating the notes, re-framing them as “seeds,” and placing the coral as a sentinel. The contrast between her “shrewdly innocent” face and the surgical precision of her emotional work gives her dimension. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized—she feels the “lotus-hearted ache” but we don’t see a sharp, on-page tug-of-war between contradictory impulses. The endurance stance at the end (her ongoing vigil and self-appointed role) feels earned, though the personal cost could be made slightly more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s burnout and tentative reawakening are convincingly sketched, with concrete anchors (empty hands, shuttered heart, the laugh that surprises her). Motivation is clear and consistent: the hunger to create again drives each micro-choice. Internal conflict—fear/ash vs. fragile joy—is present but could be more sharply dramatized under pressure rather than mostly described. The final stance shift (carrying the daydream as a “secret negative”) feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s vocation, temperament, and inner shift from “restorer” to generative artist are clear and particular, with choices (coming to the garden, speaking into the reflector, painting the blank wall, leaving the nickel) all aligned to that drive. The internal conflict is largely conceptual (chemistry-obeying restorer vs. wonder-driven artist) rather than dramatized through resistance, so the struggle feels gentle rather than pressured. Emotions are mostly embedded in perception rather than labeled, which works, but the “nested awakenings” are told a bit abstractly instead of embodied in more specific moments of doubt or fear. Her final renunciation (placing the nickel) reads as earned but not heavily costed.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is vividly sketched as the charming rogue scholar with clear, specific motivation, and his competence under pressure feels earned. However, he faces little palpable inner conflict or doubt on the page, which flattens potential complexity. Dr. Voss is intriguing but mostly functions as a facilitator rather than a pressure source. The final endurance—accepting capture while trusting his planted ideas—is credible but could land harder with more embodied emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—refusing sides, then transforming grief into beauty—is clear and consistent, and her choice to “ensconce herself deeper” pays off at the ending. Interiority is vivid and particular (“insomniac poet cataloging the silence that followed the war”), with a strong sense of embodied longing. However, we rarely see live contradictory impulses in the moment; her renunciation reads more as lyric summary than as an on-page struggle between competing drives. The arc feels emotionally credible but slightly too smooth for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The caretaker’s core motive—preserving forgotten names—is clear, consistent, and drives her choices, especially the decision to sacrifice the bamboo tube. Interiority is evocative (“foxglove regret”) but largely one-note; we get sorrowful dedication more than layered, contradictory impulses. Her choice to act with the tube feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with little visible hesitation or alternative considered. The ending registers as Earned Stasis, but the emotional cost could be sharpened through more conflicted micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and internal contradiction (guilt, urgency, hope) are sharply etched and consistently drive her choices, especially the willingness to risk both the wards and his rejection. Her emotional life is concrete (the weight of the ink well, the feel of the archive) rather than abstract summary. Julian is less developed but functions credibly as the necessary counterpoint with his caution and silence. The final conditional offer (“If you accept… If not…”) feels earned and forecloses a path with a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation is strong and specific—shaped by long-term professional pride, discovery of the original letters, and an ethical commitment that culminates in defying his supervisors. His emotional life is embodied (trembling hands, tactile engagement with tools) and particular to a meticulous machinist. The final choice to falsify reports and preserve the failsafe reads as earned and aligned with his traits. However, the internal conflict is largely pre-resolved; we’re mostly watching articulation and execution of a decision rather than a live struggle between contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives—preserving the “echo of lost songs” versus protecting herself via reinvention—are vivid and consistently dramatized, especially in the choice to send the meteorite away instead of selling it. Her interior conflict between isolation and trust runs through concrete habits (dust-mapping, hiding in the attic) and culminates in a credible, costly shift when she goes downstairs ready to use her true name. The pigeons, attic, and chip all serve as extensions of her psychology rather than decorative props. If anything, the detectives as off-stage pressure could be slightly sharper to test her under more immediate stress.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding sacred vs hollow thresholds—is clear, particular, and carried consistently through her perceptions and choices. Her status as the “lost child” who does not wish to be found adds a credible, specific contradiction. Emotional experience is mostly conveyed via thought and image rather than embodied tension, so her stakes feel a bit cool. The final decision to step into the maze fits what we know of her but lands more as serene completion than a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (scientific duty, mentor-loyalty, hunger for belonging) are clear and coherently embodied in her actions, especially in the collaborative calculations and the forehead-to-glass choice. Her inner life is particular enough—“seeking the rhythm of belonging that had eluded her in the world above”—though internal contradiction under pressure is hinted more than fully dramatized. The phantom researcher functions mainly as a gentle mirror and catalyst rather than a fully pressured agent, but his loneliness and quiet resolve register. The final shift—carrying the “rhythm of belonging” upward—is earned and feels like a credible reconfiguration rather than a grafted epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s role, vocation, and core motivation are clear and consistent, and her repeated micro-choices to keep working and to reinterpret the “missing pieces” create a quiet but legible arc. However, her interiority stays largely at the level of lyrical abstraction—there’s little concrete, embodied emotion or lived contradiction beyond serene curiosity and acceptance. The absence of genuine internal conflict or visible cost at the end keeps her from feeling fully dimensional. This reads as a strong concept-character more than a fully realized human psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s sensibility is vivid and specific—his belief that “monotony was a prison” and his ritual with the bishop and music box give him a clear, distinctive psychology. However, he encounters little resistance, and his internal conflict is minimal; he’s competent and untroubled, which blunts depth. The woman in gray is effectively sketched but remains more emblematic than individuated. The final “choice” for Kael (to perform the ritual and bow) lacks a felt cost, keeping the characterization short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelin’s core motivation—to preserve forbidden memory through her body—is clear and consistent, and her final choice to “fledge” into permanent exile is legible and earned by prior setup. However, internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we’re told this is the “final phase” and an irrevocable act, but we don’t really see her torn or tested on the page. Her emotions are beautifully filtered through image (tide, ink, stars) but lack a few concrete, character-particular contradictions under pressure. The result is strong but a bit too serenely inevitable for elite-level depth.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear, specific life context (glazier, divorce, estranged daughter, tremor, refusal to retire) and his desire “to illuminate value in the mundane” feels character-rooted rather than generic. His interiority is evocative and non-stock, with a believable, quiet crisis of purpose. However, most of the conflict is conceptualized rather than embodied—little in the way of concrete, in-scene contradiction or messy impulse, so the final stance shift is more intellectual than emotionally costly. A touch more on-page friction (e.g., a tremor interfering with the stone throw, a more visceral reaction) would deepen the sense of lived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally conflicted—her guilt, professional competence, and need to “translate” pain all feel lived-in and motivate her choice to give Elias the marble. The embodied details of her scars, the melted door handle, and her remembered bargaining with God make her more than an archetypal veteran. Elias is thinner but still credible, and their status dynamic (mentor/new recruit) is clear and shifting as she opens up. The final endurance—Maya descending alone with an empty box and unchanged scars—reads as earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are crystal-clear, and her methodical temperament fits the piece’s intellectual ambition, but she reads almost entirely as a perfected function rather than a conflicted person. Interiority is abstract—heavy on “logical dreaming” and “burden of knowing” but light on embodied, contradictory feeling under pressure. Her exhaustion at the end gestures toward cost without dramatizing any moment where she nearly fails or wants something incompatible with her mission. The result is conceptually strong but emotionally somewhat flat for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s vocation, temperament, and motivation are clear and consistent, and her final stance—choosing to carry the house’s memories—feels organically rooted in what we’ve seen. However, her interiority leans toward generalized abstraction (“burden of legacy”) rather than sharply embodied, character-specific conflict. We rarely see contradictory impulses in real-time; she receives and processes, but is not forced into a difficult trade-off or visible mistake. Elias functions effectively as a ghost-presence but remains more thematic device than fully individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vivid as a mythic functionary—“merely pigment and shade” without a heartbeat—but less so as a psychologically complex individual. His motivation (to make humans see possibility) is clear and consistent, yet interior contradiction is minimal; he remains serenely competent rather than genuinely torn. The strongest character moment is the tension between his “perceptively calm” surface and the quickening, stolen pulse as time runs out. The final vanishing feels thematically apt but not deeply reconfigured on an emotional level, keeping this short of top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s history as a former strategist turned peace negotiator, carrying “the names of forty thousand dead,” gives her motives weight and coherently drives her choice of a slow, costly peace. We feel a lived contradiction between her “operatively gentle nature” and the ruthlessness of her past orders, even if the present-tense emotional struggle is more stated than minutely dramatized. The general’s bitterness and the child’s grief are quickly but vividly individualized and they apply immediate pressure to Elara’s choices. The final acceptance of an imperfect, generational peace feels earned by what we’ve learned about her values and limits.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a ruthless yet grief-stricken industrialist, and his contradictory impulses—destroying ecosystems to honor extinction—feel particular and embodied. Motivation is clear and specific (to create a moment of “fractured grace” for the Azure Crane), and his final act of burial reads as an earned renunciation/ritual rather than a twist. However, much of his conflict is articulated in reflective exposition rather than dramatized in present-tense micro-choices under pressure, so the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The emotional register stays controlled, with little on-page fraying or deterioration as the storm closes in.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lys’s motivation—resisting the Empire’s enforced oblivion and the House’s sexualized control—is clear and consistently embedded in her choices, especially in the link between chastity and integrity-as-weapon. Her interiority is vivid and particular (“virginity a blade she whetted against the lullaby of conformity”) rather than generic. However, we rarely see her genuinely torn or faltering in the moment; the trial reads as difficult but not truly jeopardizing her resolve. The final endurance feels earned but a bit too frictionless to fully foreground cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s psychology is sharply drawn: a self-justifying aesthete whose craft and ethics are entangled, with credible blind spots (“confused the beauty of letterforms with the morality of messages”). His reversal is motivated by specific experiences—the argument, the lonely dome, and the blind storyteller’s tale—rather than abstract handwaving. The internal conflict between control and surrender is continuous, though his shift toward “restoration” arrives a bit smoothly, with limited on-page resistance. Secondary characters are thin but correctly used as pressure sources rather than full co-protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories without sentimental denial—is sharply defined and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. Her interiority is specific and character-particular (“magic was merely the physics of attention”), avoiding generic emotional language. The main limitation is that her internal conflict stays mostly conceptual; we don’t see a real-time tug-of-war between despair and purpose so much as a settled philosophy enacted. The ending reads as an earned endurance rather than a new turn, which is fitting but somewhat limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and history are clear and specific—the failed death mask and subsequent self-forgiveness give her present actions emotional weight. However, most of the real conflict (her guilt and struggle) is past-tense; on the page she moves with serene competence, so contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal. Her emotional embodiment largely comes through extended metaphor rather than concrete, conflicted reactions in the moment. The closing shift—ice in her heart finally melted—is thematically apt but feels more affirmed than actively contested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Foresight Hindsight’s interiority is vivid and specific, with clear motivation rooted in being the last guardian of a decaying directive and her willingness to be chosen by the path. Her actions—preparing the ritual, ingesting the compound, and finally walking away from the bunker—track cleanly with that motivation. The main limitation is that her internal conflict stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a live struggle between contradictory impulses in the peak beats. The cost of leaving her post is felt, but more as idea than as raw, embodied rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elior’s frugality, skepticism, and buried longing are sharply drawn and consistent, and his final choice to “spend everything he had saved” feels earned by the prior setup. The internal contradiction between empiricism and wonder is clear, though it’s expressed more in conceptual language than in concrete, embodied emotion. His micro-choices (burning three candles, hoarding belief, speaking the sequence aloud) track well with his motives. A bit more visceral response to the tile’s transformation would deepen the emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation as a “scheming pacifist” is vivid and consistent, and his use of empathy as strategy is well dramatized through the music-box keying of resentment. His interiority is concrete enough (the pin pricking his thumb, remembering his father’s anger) to individualize him. What’s lacking is real friction or contradiction in him—he never seriously wavers, doubts, or missteps, so his victory feels slightly too assured. The entity, while conceptually strong, remains more emblem than character, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive and craft-anchored worldview are clear and specific, and his actions consistently track his goal of recapturing the dream. The glassmaker’s bodily engagement (breath, calloused fingers, heavy boots) gives a grounded sense of him. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost—he succeeds without real emotional abrasion, doubt, or moral friction. The “firmly grounded” trait is named more than it is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is sharply realized: her profession, prosthetic quartz eyes, feistiness, and complicated ties to both the cathedral and her family all surface through concrete choices (climbing again, working despite the broken contract, re-siting the ribbon). Her motivation—to work because she and the structure mutually need it, and to renegotiate her relationship with her daughter and grandmother’s legacy—is clear and consistent. Internal conflict between preservation and acceptance, and between anger and longing for her daughter, is present but mostly implied rather than fully dramatized in live interaction. The final renunciation of rigid, contractual “mending” in favor of seasonal return feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost, though the daughter-relationship cost could be made slightly more acute on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand and “preserve” her nonlinear inheritance and forbidden knowledge) is clear and consistently rendered, and her bewilderment is baked into her worldview in a specific way. Internal progression from confusion to a kind of accepting, looping stasis is legible, especially in the bathroom and final shell beats. However, her emotions are often articulated in abstract, conceptual language (“brightened disquiet,” “simply complicated paradox”) rather than embodied, and she is rarely forced into a sharp, costly choice. The result is a convincing but somewhat bloodless interior arc that could use one more grounded, contradictory impulse under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (rescue of erased concepts via the Library of Unlearned Lessons) is clear and consistently pursued, and her expertise-driven micro-choices (re-reading “damaged” pages, interpreting botanical ciphers) feel grounded in who she is. Interiority is mostly conceptual rather than emotionally embodied, which slightly flattens the sense of real psychological cost. Her contradiction—scholar of language learning to “listen to absence”—is present but could be dramatized more in on-page tension rather than summarized insight. The chrononaut is effectively a symbolic foil rather than a character under pressure, which suits the piece but limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation and identity conflict are clear and specific—she wants to “recapture” the narrative of her chimera twin—and her final acceptance of being “the threshold where both met” feels earned. However, she often functions more as a poetic vector for theme than as a fully individuated person with concrete flaws, habits, or idiosyncrasies. Internal contradiction is present (comfort vs. cost of plurality) but remains conceptual rather than embodied in messy, situational choices. The emotional beats land, but at an elite level I’d want at least one more grounded, character-particular moment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s professional identity and motivation are clear and consistent, and her competence feels grounded in specific habits (“warmly methodical… precise arrangement of her indexing tools”). What’s missing at this level is embodied emotional contradiction or real internal friction about rewriting three centuries of history; she never visibly doubts, fears, or wavers. Her final shift from passive archivist to active shaper is conceptually strong but not accompanied by a felt personal cost. The character is vivid and particular, but the arc is too smooth to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s goal and method are clear and consistent, and her occupational specificity as “ripple-mark mapkeeper” feels organic. However, interiority is relatively thin: we see competence and resolve but little in the way of contradictory impulses, fear, or doubt under pressure. Her final endurance choice (staying to tend the hush) is motivated but emotionally under-dramatized, so the cost reads more conceptual than felt. This limits the depth of character change or earned stasis at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply sketched as a solitary, driven custodian whose retrocognition and obsession with pattern feel specific and credible, and her micro-choices (collecting coincidences, climbing with the prism, deciding to risk activating it) align cleanly with that core. Emotional texture is present in embodied ways (pressure at her temples, trembling hands), but internal contradiction is relatively mild—she doesn’t meaningfully waver or self-sabotage, so the final act costs her little beyond fatigue and long-term burden. The role’s loneliness and responsibility are vivid, yet her success feels psychologically smooth rather than hard-won. This keeps the characterization strong but shy of the deepest, most conflicted tier.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent: her “preemptively nostalgic” ache, the way she measures shadows for emotional weight, and her choice to let the weather write through her all feel rooted in a distinct psyche. Her core contradiction—wanting to preserve memories while mourning their loss as private discoveries—runs cleanly through the piece. The culminating shift from archivist to archive is well-motivated by prior beats, with the cost of surrendering her separateness legible on the page. This is sophisticated, though the piece never quite puts her under relational or ethical pressure beyond that conceptual dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to counter the fortress’s despair through his art—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete choices (climbing the tower, using the rag knot, destroying the mosaic). His interiority comes through more via sensory focus and professional habit than explicit thought, which suits the piece’s lyric mode. However, internal contradiction is muted; he rarely doubts, fears, or hesitates, so we lose some potential tension in his psyche. The final “cost” to him is mostly conceptual (satisfaction and moving on) rather than a deeply felt personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya and the narrator both feel specific and psychologically coherent: her marginal-life ethos, his need for a concrete answer, and their differing tolerances for uncertainty all read clearly in micro-choices (her turning away to the pool; his reframing the demand into “I don’t need an answer tonight”). The relationship is the crucible and status is legible—he’s the one asking, she’s the one controlling time and terms. Internal conflict is present but could be more embodied and contradictory; both characters remain relatively composed and articulate under pressure, with little real fraying. The final refusal-to-answer/acceptance-of-pause is earned and carries a quiet cost, but the emotional messiness is somewhat smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s characterization is rich and specific: the bunker builder’s claustrophobic daughter whose longing for horizon conflicts with inherited “safety.” Her motivation—to reclaim her mother’s cultivated silence as a survival tool—is clear and deepens as she moves through the trellis. Internal contradiction (drawn to openness, forced back underground) is consistently embodied in choices like climbing to the trellis then willingly returning before the hour ends. The final endurance—bringing the gilded hush back into the bunker—reads as an earned, costly stasis rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is sharply etched through her ritualized work, long tenure, and vocation-like commitment to silence, and her micro-choices (adjusting resonators, holding the gondola in the still pocket) align with that. The architect is thinner, more a receptacle for the process than a fully individuated character, though her grief is legible. Internal contradiction in Mara (cost, doubt, or failure) is underplayed, so she reads as almost serenely competent. The emotional shift in the architect at the end is credible but arrives a bit easily given the depth of regret implied.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (preserving knowledge over seeking power) is clear, consistent, and integrated with her actions, especially in rejecting the throne and focusing on the archive. Interiority is present but somewhat generalized—her emotional textures under pressure (fear, doubt, temptation) are underexplored compared to the density of worldbuilding. The “wisely adventurous” trait does show on the page in her methodical approach to risk, but there’s little genuine internal conflict or moral ambiguity testing that value set. Her final realization aligns with what we already know of her rather than significantly complicating or deepening it, which keeps the arc credible but not fully rich.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to save Mira by excising himself—and Mira’s counter-motivation—returning to learn to breathe—are clear, coherent, and drive their choices. The scar-touch lesson externalizes their history in a vivid, character-specific way. However, the piece leans on conceptual language over concrete behavior, so their contradictions and blind spots feel more thematic than psychologically messy. A few lines verge on therapy-speak abstraction, softening the rawness of their emotional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya is vivid: a guilty, “virtuously mischievous” ex–crypto-cultist whose history with pyramid schemes clearly motivates her attraction to the bolt and her desire to repurpose pressure. Her interiority is specific and textured (e.g., “geometry of her ruined investment portfolios”), and the link between past siphoning and present “tricking the universe” is strong. However, emotion skews conceptual rather than bodily in key beats—her physical/visceral reactions under extreme pressure could be sharper. The final acceptance of becoming a “pressure vessel” feels earned but a bit too smooth, with little visible hesitation at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s role and motivation as a “dynasty ender” are clear and consistent, and their choices (recovering the crank, turning it, copying the symbols) align with that purpose. However, interiority stays largely archetypal and abstract rather than embodied and particular; we learn far more about their function than their individual contradictions or fears. The silence constraint is interesting but not mined for internal conflict (no palpable urge to speak, panic, or doubt under pressure). The final endurance—quietly copying the last symbols—is credible but not emotionally costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Valen’s obsessive drive “to capture the shape of possibility itself” is clear and consistent, and his long silence plus monk-and-battlefield past give him a distinctive psychology. Internal conflict—clinging to isolation versus surrendering to the pattern—is present but could be dramatized more viscerally in moment-to-moment hesitation or doubt. His final surrender (unsnapping armor, accepting marionette strings) feels earned by prior setup. The cost of his change (loss of singular self and solitude) is legible but could be emotionally sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s grief, ethical drive, and methodical temperament are clearly rendered, and her choices (refusing to cull, investigating the anomaly, creating the supplemental index) all feel motivated and coherent. The sergeant, though off-page, gains surprising dimensionality through his repeated tokens. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction in Maya—her broken-heartedness rarely produces messy or self-thwarting impulses, so the internal conflict arc feels relatively smooth. The final shift to “examined conviction” is earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as the ink-stained, underestimated archivist whose competence and paranoia pay off in concrete tactics (memorizing documents, salvaging the key, engineering the backup). His motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions all align with preserving memory against revision. What’s missing at this tier is real internal contradiction under pressure—he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses—so the emotional cost of his choice stays more conceptual than embodied. The final endurance (remaining invisible, moving on with “nothing but obsolete keys”) is credible but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and vocation are sharply defined—his life-long commitment “to the art of silence between sounds” is specific and convincing, and his micro-choices in how he plays under pressure feel rooted in that. The inherited burden from his mentor adds depth, especially the image of the mentor dissolving mid-melody. However, internal contradiction and psychological texture are relatively light; he reads more as a mythic functionary than a conflicted, fully human character. The endurance choice at the end (returning every morning) is earned but could land harder with more on-page ambivalence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—cataloging extinction and then seizing a chance at renewal—is clear, consistent, and rooted in his long, orderly vocation. His interiority is concrete and specific (“mossy delight,” the cairns and shrines) rather than generic. The final transformation is emotionally earned but almost wholly embraced; there’s little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse at the climax, which slightly flattens complexity. A bit more dramatized ambivalence about becoming the seed itself would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara reads as specific and internally conflicted—the meticulous “broken-clock tinkerer” who wants control yet is forced to move by intuition on the stones. Her lifelong trait of trying to budget for chaos is directly challenged by the waterfall crossing, and the shift to “befriending” uncertainty feels earned. Emotion is mostly embedded in perception and action rather than labels. The cost of change (risking her life, abandoning the comfort of calculation) is clear though could be shaded with one more moment of visceral fear.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives and worldview are clear and particular—her commitment to balance, law-bound magic, and love for Kael coherently drive her choice to attempt an impossible redemption. However, her internal conflict is under-dramatized: we’re told of regret and principles, but we rarely see contradictory impulses clash in-scene (there’s little sense she might accept his loss or fear violating her own laws). Kael, though moving as an image at the end, remains more symbol than character. The final acceptance of “repair, not replacement” is emotionally apt but comes with limited felt cost or ambivalence on Elara’s part.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, ritual, and willingness to absorb pain are clear and particular, and her small contradictions (trembling hands vs “modestly fearless”) give texture. Her motivation to integrate laughter into healing is strong but partly told in thesis-like language rather than fully dramatized. The ghost with the umbrella has just enough individuality through her guarded laughter to matter without crowding the frame. The main limitation is a relative lack of deep internal struggle or costly ambivalence in Elara at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and particular, with her enhanced proprioception and torture history giving her a distinctive way of thinking and feeling. Her motive—seeking the “algorithm of forgiveness”—is clear and consistently drives her attention. However, the emotional palette leans heavily into one intense register; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond endure/understand, which slightly flattens complexity. The final conceptual shift feels earned but could carry more visible ambivalence or cost in her behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, tools, and backstory (her grandmother’s erasure) give her a coherent, specific motivation, and her actions in the scene align cleanly with that drive. Her interiority is sensorial and particular (weight of grief, hue of exhaustion) rather than generic. However, there’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page—she never seriously wavers, so the final “choice” feels more like skilled execution than a pressured decision. As a result, the emotional cost to her remains somewhat underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s characterization is clear, specific, and appealing: a pragmatic technician whose comfort with ghosts and near-engineer’s mindset give her a distinctive lens. Her motivation (“to discover what ceilings hide”) plausibly underlies both her job and her willingness to probe the haunting. However, her interior conflict is muted—she moves through each beat with high competence and little visible doubt or struggle, which softens the emotional cost of her final choice. A touch more friction between her rational, mechanical framing and the uncanny stakes would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (“to compress eternity into a moment”) is clear and consistently dramatized through her methodical work with frost, bottle, and press, and her professional specificity as a letterpress operator feels credible. However, she experiences little on-page doubt, fear, or contradictory impulse, and no meaningful personal cost is registered when she destabilizes the world. The internal conflict is largely implied rather than dramatized in concrete, embodied reactions. The result is a strong but somewhat untested characterization that feels more emblematic than fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interior life is specific and coherent: the defunct revolutionary turned melancholic custodian of time feels textured, with his guilt, pride, and tenderness all informing his choices. His motivation to “rescue them from Voss’s narrative of domination” naturally grows from his past and culminates in his decision to remain on the asteroid. Internal conflict—between seizing and witnessing, between manifestos and elegies—is present, though it could be embodied in a few more concrete, sensory micro-choices under peak pressure rather than explained. Still, the final renunciation of leaving with the expedition is clearly earned and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated (save the world by restoring the keystone box), with lived-in vocational detail and some history, and his actions track consistently with that purpose. However, the covenant’s demand for absolute truth never produces real internal contradiction or temptation, so we don’t see him under genuine moral or psychological strain. The line “confirming that his heart held no falsehood” clarifies purity rather than dramatizing struggle. As a result, the final endurance/change feels more like fulfillment of a foregone role than a costly personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are sharply drawn (petrichor vials, psychometry from her grandmother, “sensibly eccentric” pragmatism), and her actions consistently flow from those traits. However, she faces little internal contradiction or genuine dilemma; her desire and the environment are in near-perfect alignment. The final stance—choosing to witness rather than explain—fits her established character but involves limited visible cost on the page. This is a vivid, coherent character portrait rather than a deeply conflicted arc.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation, sensibility, and shift in artistic philosophy are clear and specific, and her actions consistently align with her identity as a material-attuned artisan. However, her internal process is almost frictionless; insight arrives without much visible resistance, fear, or contradictory impulse on the page. The cost of her change—what she’s giving up in her previous practice—remains mostly conceptual rather than emotionally embodied. This keeps the arc compelling but short of the truly searing, high-stakes interiority expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s grief, curiosity, and quiet drive are consistently embodied through her rituals (handling the postcards, daily blue-hour visits, repainting the mural). The central motivational throughline—reinterpreting her mother’s relationship to darkness—is clear and earned by accumulation rather than a single forced epiphany. Internal conflict (seeing her mother as “creature of darkness” vs. realizing she prepared for light) is present but could surface more in on-page frictive moments rather than arriving mostly as reflection. Still, the final reconfiguration of her stance toward her mother feels motivated and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s role, duty, and torment are sharply defined, and his key decisions (descending, arranging debris, reciting names) track cleanly with his archivist ethos. His interiority is vivid but leans on declarative insight (“his solemn duty… had transformed into a haunting possession”) more than dramatized contradiction, so his internal conflict feels slightly pre-digested. The cost—risking his sanity and bodily safety—is present but more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. The final acceptance of the “communion” is earned but a bit tidy for the extremity of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling—refuse nostalgic resurrection, build a new order—and her core dilemma (smash the bottle for comforting restoration vs. use it to found a harsher, rational future) is well motivated. Interiority is specific and tied to her craft, especially in the “working memory” sequence. However, her emotional life skews conceptual rather than embodied, and outside the central choice we see limited contradictory impulses or textural flaws that would deepen her as a person rather than an idea-bearer.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias feels specific and lived-in—a man of ritual, solitude, and linguistic obsession—and his long tenure as oath scribe credibly underpins his reaction to the wax shaving. His core drive (archiving emotional patterns) is clear and his choice to ingest the shaving tracks with that vocation. What’s thinner is active internal conflict: there’s little sense of hesitation or competing impulse before he effectively sacrifices his body to the archive. The shift reads more as smooth destiny than a pressured choice with visibly contested cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and specific—last seed keeper, bound by “vortex inheritance” and a thirty-winter vigil—but she reads more as an archetypal priestess than a fully contradictory individual. Emotions are often effectively embodied (“storm raging in her chest,” breath crystallizing) and her micro-choices (placing the cap, singing the songs, deciding to stay) track well with her stated values. However, internal conflict is underplayed; she rarely wavers, so her final commitment carries less felt cost than it could. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, quiet authority, and long apprenticeship are vividly established, and her choice to reject the sirens in favor of the bell is clearly motivated. Her interiority is specific (microclimate attention, respect for monks’ original intent) rather than generic. However, the decision carries little dramatized ambivalence or contradiction on the page; she never seriously wavers or fears consequences, which blunts depth. The arc reads as a confirmation of an already-held belief more than a pressured, costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian is specific and textured—a lonely, spiritually curious caretaker whose decades of service and hunger for meaning clearly motivate his choices with the yellow glass and his final walk into dawn. His emotional life is embodied in images (pressing the glass to his chest, dancing barefoot) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; the movement from isolation-as-imprisonment to isolation-as-preparation feels a bit tidy, with little on-page struggle at the moment of revaluation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his seven-year silence, his stillness as “astonishment,” his compulsion to keep the box without knowing why—all feel concrete and character-particular. His shift from isolated survivor to chosen repository is motivated by his observant nature and history with the place. However, internal conflict is muted: his acceptance of the role comes with little on-page resistance or ambivalence, softening the sense of costly change. The unread letter suggests a richer, more conflicted psyche than the story actually dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role and motivation as the last timekeeper are clear and particular, and her shift from hoarding “borrowed increments” to embracing sovereign continuity reads as a genuine internal change. However, her interiority is largely conceptual rather than conflicted in-the-moment; we’re told her survival depends on stolen moments but don’t see a concrete, pressured trade-off dramatized. The moment with the shard (“cut her palm without drawing blood”) is strong but could dig deeper into contradictory impulses (terror of losing control vs desire to feel time). The final acceptance feels earned but emotionally smoothed, with little visible cost beyond an abstract relinquishing of her prior function.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s motivation—to tend broken things and seek beauty in incompleteness—is clear and consistently expressed through her choices, especially in how she “fixes” the kite. Interiority is mostly implied through attention and action rather than explicit thought, which suits the piece but keeps internal contradiction soft: she recognizes that restoring the kite “to its former shape would be a lie,” yet the decision comes easily, without much dramatized struggle. The boy functions mainly as a foil and witness; his fear and confusion are believable but lightly sketched. The final stance—accepting and even valuing the broken—feels earned but relatively low-cost and serene.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—he wants to leave behind a lasting embassy of coexistence and responds to death with work rather than panic. However, his interiority stays mostly at the level of serene resolve; we don’t see much contradiction, fear, or doubt undercutting that calm in scene. The illness is summarized rather than dramatized as it pressures specific choices, which mutes the sense of struggle. His final endurance and acceptance are earned but somewhat unidimensional emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation as a “luminous skeptic” and dissident scientist is clear and consistent, and her choice to join the illicit lab is well-grounded in her rebellious stance. Emotional texture is mostly conceptual rather than bodily, so internal contradiction and visceral stakes feel muted. The secondary characters are sketched with purpose (spectrometer, soil, “forbidden calculations”) but exert little direct interpersonal pressure on Elara. The closing stance—choosing ongoing skeptical inquiry rather than comfort—is thematically apt but carries a relatively abstract, lightly felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coachman’s motivation and temperament are vivid and specific—patient, scholarly, devoutly focused on reclamation—but he functions more as an archetypal figure than a fully conflicted human. His goal is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it throughout. However, there’s little on-page internal contradiction or emotional cost; he never wavers or pays a visible personal price. The result is strong, coherent characterization that stops short of deep, pressure-tested complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ash’s motivation—to bridge the loss of Mara—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his sensory way of moving through the world. His interiority is strong for a non-human POV, with grief and loyalty made concrete through smell, vibration, and habit. The final choice to rest with the leaf and “sing” feels earned by his persistence across days of searching. The main limit is a relative lack of internal contradiction; his drive is pure rather than conflicted, so the arc is more deepening than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, particular, and grounded in concrete objects (the compass rose, the journal), and her motivation to transform exile into mapping feels earned. The mutation, family history, and professional role cohere into a specific person rather than a type. Internal contradiction (despair vs. determination) is present but lightly sketched rather than dramatized through competing impulses in scene. Her final choice to step through the threshold is motivated and credible, though the emotional cost is more summarized than freshly felt in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation (amending the broken Concord via truth rather than theft) is clear, consistent, and tied to his chivalrous-thief history in a satisfying way. His interiority is concrete at times (altitude sickness, hallucinations) but he experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradiction under pressure, which flattens potential complexity. The relationship with the guardian has a nice status dynamic that shifts into mutual vulnerability during the chess exchange. The closing transformation from “thief” to “keeper of renewed wonder” is thematically apt but emotionally under-contested, feeling almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation and contradictions are vivid: former “crisis actor” turned genuine survivor choosing exposure over safety is a strong, specific engine. Her benevolent ruthlessness versus complicity is dramatized in the act of cutting the cords while shielding the ledger. Emotional texture is mostly embodied in her relation to space and objects rather than generic labels. If anything, a touch more lived, bodily reaction to risk and guilt would deepen the already strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vey’s motivation—escaping painful memory and then reorienting toward architecting “home”—is clear and consistent, and their choices (approaching the stone, taking it to the summit, choosing not to substitute reality) track well with that arc. The interiority is vivid and character-specific, especially in how perception blends language, architecture, and pain. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses (urge to keep numbing vs urge to face memory) are more implied than dramatized moment-to-moment, so the climactic embrace of pain feels a touch streamlined. A bit more on-page wobble or resistance in the decision to stop substituting reality would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation—self-exoneration after the prince’s death—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his micro-choices (tweezers, threads, persistence), and the final decision to stay in the village feels like a credible evolution rather than a reversal. The line “He was winnowing more than fiber and metal; he was separating the essential mistake from the accumulated debris of self-loathing” grounds his inner conflict in a vivid, personal frame. His competence and guilt are both well dramatized, avoiding saintliness or melodrama. A touch more contradictory impulse in the final choice (lingering desire to return to court vs. staying) would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s artistic defiance and eventual surrender of control are clearly motivated and consistent, and Lira’s jar-opening mischief meaningfully tests and reshapes Kael’s stance. The internal conflict—resist the Overseers vs. relinquish ownership of the story—is dramatized rather than merely stated. However, emotional life is more conceptual than embodied; we get very little in the way of specific fear, bodily sensation, or irrational contradiction under pressure. The Overseers remain flat, purely functional presences, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s devotion, guilt, and doubt are clearly embodied in her tactile interaction with the statue (“reading the topography of grief like Braille”) and in her fear of “varnishing ruin.” Her motivation to resurrect/repair her mentor’s meaning under a literal death clock feels specific and earned. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened—there’s little true temptation to quit or misstep, so her final certainty costs less than it might. The mentor relationship is powerful but one-sided, with no new relational complication once the eyes open.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief, avoidance, and need for completion are clear and consistently embodied, from not touching his brushes to refusing to turn back in the caves. His micro-choices under pressure (continuing after the wrong turn, placing the shell, then painting) all flow logically from his history with Marguerite. The interior language is occasionally abstract (“weight of absolution”), but still tied to specific actions and objects. The final shift—from paralysis to a tentative capacity to begin again—feels earned and credibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to counter Voss’s brutality with a gentler, more effective method—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his actions (rescuing the cork, building the receiver, choosing to act while Voss sleeps). His emotional life is vivid and particular (“weeping with the violence of his own quiet”), with a credible history of five years as the “whisper” under another man’s “thunder.” Internal contradiction (fear/tenderness vs the need to intervene) is present but could be dramatized under sharper, more immediate pressure. Voss functions more as a looming philosophy than as an active crucible relationship on the page, slightly limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The navigator’s interiority is vivid, specific, and embodied—her arrhythmic leg, lunar cognition, and refusal to evacuate read as one coherent, flawed psyche under pressure. Motivation (to reach her daughter / the departed through this compass of grief) is clear and steadily intensifies as she builds. The Earned Stasis at the end—choosing to remain and touch the humming bronze—is fully motivated and costs her any illusion of outward rescue. The only small limitation is that contradictory impulses (leave vs. stay, hope vs. acceptance) are stated more in conceptual terms than dramatized in a pressured on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s motives are clear and layered: professional expertise, longing for psychological safety, and fear of the Council all interact to drive her choices. The internal contradiction between her rational, scientifically trained mind and her willingness to embrace “discredited” ritual is well dramatized rather than merely told. Her involuntary truthfulness adds a sharp constraint to the incantation beat, giving her spoken “I am afraid” real cost. The only limitation is that all pressure is self-generated; no on-page relationship or external agent presses back to complicate her further.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s solitude, ritualized life, and response to the boutonnière create a specific, embodied inner world, and her decision to investigate rather than recoil feels grounded in her keeper’s temperament. The emotional progression from shock to curiosity to acceptance is credible and textured, with details like matching her hands to the ghost-memory doing strong character work. Her final acceptance of the inheritance (“She would remain, as the stranger had remained…”) reads as an Earned Stasis with visible cost. The only slight limitation is that her internal contradictions stay relatively understated; we don’t see much simultaneous pull between fleeing the inheritance and embracing it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arthur is sharply drawn through his vocation, habits, and long pursuit; the link between map expertise and how he reads the cavern and ants feels specific and alive. His motivation—keeping a promise to Thomas and finding the doorway—is consistent and drives every choice. However, his internal conflict under peak pressure (risk of drowning vs. retreat vs. accepting this strange curatorial destiny) stays largely implied rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses. The final decision feels right but almost too smooth, with limited on-page sense of emotional cost beyond a generalized “purpose.”

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives—disbelief of the astrologers, unease with her crown, compulsion to follow the dreams—are clear and consistent, and her final act of reaching into the pool tracks with what we’ve seen. The abdication is well seeded by the image of the crown left in ashes. However, her internal conflict is relatively smooth; there’s little real resistance or contradictory impulse on the page once she reaches the grotto. The relationship with Mara is suggestive (“prophecy and betrayal”) but under-explored in scene, so the relational crucible never fully ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation-driven motivation is clear and specific, and her desire “to capture the density of presence” credibly organizes her choices in the scene. We see her act under pressure—preparing instruments, timing the shell, deciding to treat the memory as alchemy rather than nostalgia—which gives her arc a modest but real before/after shift. Internal contradiction is present but muted: her long history of absence vs. the courageous decision to stay vulnerable tonight is implied rather than dramatized in conflict beats. Mira is more emblematic than deeply rendered, functioning primarily as the necessary counterpart to complete Elara’s experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (terror of fragmentation, envy of past selves, professional compulsion to chronicle) are clear and consistent, and his choice at the end—to accept chronicling rather than trying to “fix” the timeline—feels earned. Interiority is vivid and particular (“getting jealous of past selves had become his method of navigation”), with credible contradictions between fear, arrogance, and jaded awe. Emotions are largely embodied via environment and objects (the scroll, the cabin, the grave), not just labels. The cost of his shift—relinquishing the illusion of control over his death—is implied rather than fully dramatized, keeping this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her history with scent and loss; her way of reinterpreting the world through sight feels character-particular and embodied. Her motivation—to find “ordinary miracles” and re-humanize time after losing smell—is clear and consistent. The emotional movement is more of a deepening than a sharp turn; she doesn’t face a genuinely pressured choice so much as reaffirm a stance, which limits the felt cost. Still, her micro-choices (lingering on the screw, deciding to return it, how she reads clients) align tightly with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—she wants to turn trauma into language—and her tactics under pressure (returning to superstition, using tears instead of ink) are well-motivated. The inherited crystallization condition concretizes her psychological stakes into bodily risk. Internal contradiction (rational scholar vs. superstitious child) is present but could be dramatized more sharply in-moment rather than mainly asserted. The final endurance/renunciation—accepting pain to finish the last rune—feels earned and has a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara is sharply drawn—a gossip columnist and exorcist whose guilt, metaphor-habit, and professional ruthlessness all feel specific and coherent. Her motivation to apologize before the orchard’s destruction is clear and drives each action. The moment she abandons metaphor for raw apology, then slides back into it, gives a credible sense of contradiction and cost. The ghost is thinner as a character but functions effectively as a focused pressure on her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist has a clear role and task, but she reads more as an archetypal function than a fully individuated person under pressure. Motivation (“to unravel cosmic illusions,” “to unify”) is stated rather than tested or complicated, and we get little contradictory impulse or embodied emotion. Her final dissolution into “the library, the dictionary, the hiccup, and the silence” has conceptual weight but almost no dramatized ambivalence or cost. This keeps the piece from a deeper, character-driven impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shepherd’s motivation is clear and specific—he wants to understand what clocks really measure—and his actions (counting backward, handling the key, leaving it behind) track cleanly to that drive. Interiority is particular and embodied through interaction with the key, water, and horizon. However, his emotional life is relatively narrow: we don’t see much contradiction or genuine internal conflict beyond a steady, contemplative curiosity. The closing renunciation (leaving the key) feels earned but carries more conceptual than personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya is sharply etched: her defensive, pattern-reading mind and professional vigilance plausibly collide with unresolved desire, and her shift from policing to participating feels earned. Eli’s motive—“the physics of letting go”—reads coherent with his posture and actions, even if it’s spoken a bit too cleanly. The relationship functions as the crucible that forces Maya’s renunciation of a guarded stance. The cost—relinquishing the comfort of seeing him as an intruder—is legible in her micro-choices around the pointer and the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her dual inheritance of gambling and probability, with clear embodied markers (trembling fingers, damaged heart) grounding her abstractions. Her contradictions—rigor vs surrender, control vs acceptance—are present throughout rather than asserted once. The final renunciation/shift (choosing to teach differently, integrating uncertainty) feels earned by prior moments with the lantern, graffiti, and memories of her father. A slight tilt toward essayistic articulation (“to widen perspectives responsibly”) softens, but doesn’t break, the sense of messy, human motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation and worldview are sharply etched—her philosophy of “cultivated estrangement” consistently drives how she handles each call. The piece sacrifices some emotional texture in her in favor of role and function; we rarely glimpse contradictions or embodied feelings beyond her controlled stance. Her micro-choices (when to hang up, how far to guide someone) do reveal a hierarchy of values with cost, but mostly on the callers’ side. The result is a powerful archetypal figure whose inner conflict remains muted, keeping this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is precise and particular—preserving “the weight of small moments” and renewing the covenant for her sister’s sake—and every action on the jetty arises cleanly from that. Her interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (salinity, gravity, the way light hits a teacup) rather than generic grief. The contradiction between her need to fix memory and her acceptance that ink and photographs must fade is elegantly dramatized in her handling of the locket at the end. The final endurance choice—to keep carrying memory gently, without re-opening the photo—reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation (relief work as cover for curing loneliness) is precise and consistent, and his rule of reciprocity meaningfully shapes his behavior and blind spot. His internal contradiction—instrumentalizing vulnerability while secretly starving for it—pays off cleanly when the child inverts the exchange. Emotion is largely inferred rather than fully embodied on the page, but the final laugh and “debt accumulating in his own chest” give him a credible, earned shift. The child is sketched economically yet lands as a decisive, believable counterforce rather than a prop.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—her history of mapping others’ emotions while fearing her own sets up a credible internal contradiction that pays off at the stillpoint. Her blindness, profession, and emotional avoidance feel integrated rather than token. The final shift (“no longer needing to dowse for what she had found within”) reads earned by the prior journey. The only softness is that her resistance and fear under pressure are more implied than dramatized moment by moment, which slightly mutes complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s guilt, professional identity, and emerging humility are clearly motivated and consistent with her choices, and her decision to preserve the lessons of her mistake makes the final stance feel earned. However, her inner life stays somewhat concept-level rather than textured with idiosyncratic specifics, and her conflict (fear vs responsibility vs desire for repair) is more stated than dramatized in behavior. The “confidently uncertain” motif gestures at contradiction but isn’t deeply explored in scene. Still, the arc from self-condemning error to a more mature relationship with failure is believable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive to make music from silence is specific, embodied through his camera and conducting, and his acceptance of being forgotten at the end feels earned. His deafness and frailty play convincingly against his former fame, and Mara’s role as interpreter/caretaker gives the relationship texture. However, internal contradiction (resentment vs acceptance, fear vs compulsion) stays mostly implied rather than put under sharper pressure in scene. A touch more friction between Elias and Mara’s hopes or tactics would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation is vivid and specific—her arsons as a campaign against colonial noise and for the protection of an indigenous covenant—and her final choice to become a “bridge” feels earned by that history. Her interiority is textured (“volcanic tenderness,” guilt sublimated into care), but she doesn’t display much live contradiction; the story largely affirms what she already is instead of forcing a sharp internal clash. Micro-choices (how and where she places each artwork) do reveal a hierarchy of values, yet they’re described more conceptually than felt as hard trade-offs. The ending registers cost in her solitude and soot-streaked grief, but the renunciation could be pushed further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s grief-driven motivation and his “quiet rebellion” are clear, specific, and consistently expressed through action (sneaking out, exploiting monitoring blind spots, using the garden for resurrection instead of data). Interiority is embodied and particular—his drumming, matching his heartbeat to the stone, and the way he reads the environment as a map back to Elena. The main limitation is a relatively soft rendering of internal contradiction: his awareness of the likely futility of resurrection never clashes on the page with his insistence strongly enough to generate sharper inner conflict. The final endurance—remaining perched until dawn, still drumming—is an earned, costly stasis rather than a revelation, and it works.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s competence, long-term obsession with the “whisper network,” and sensory focus on footsteps create a specific, convincing interior without resorting to labels. Motivation (proving the theory and protecting ships/supplies) is clear and consistent, but we don’t see much genuine internal contradiction or moral friction. The relationship with Voss has texture and history but doesn’t face a choice that changes its state on the page. The ending registers as confirmation rather than a costly shift in Kael’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian’s motive—“to teach darkness the value of stars”—is clear and consistent, and their ritualized actions align with it. However, interiority is mostly summarized insight (“Years ago, the guardian had learned…”) rather than embodied contradiction or live dilemma. The guardian feels archetypal more than individuated, with little sense of personal cost or flaw. The final lowering of the mirror reads as a calm completion of routine rather than a pressured choice that exposes deeper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (“to plant forests of second thoughts”) is clear, coherent with his gift, and pays off in the ending stance, but it’s largely asserted rather than tested under pressure. His interiority is vivid and particular, yet he encounters no serious resistance, doubt, or temptation that would force contradictory impulses to collide on the page. The loneliness implied by hearing unspoken words is gestured at but never dramatized as a live cost in this scene. As a result, he reads as an emblematic figure more than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between the “false self” moored to the docks and the call of her true nature is specific and well-motivated, with clear history in the Binding Treaties and her years at the harbor. Her choice to release the mooring cable and step into the water feels earned by prior beats. The embodiment of emotion is often strong (“bone was warm…humming with a frequency that matched the ache in her guarded heart”), though the repetition of “guarded heart” and similar abstractions occasionally flattens nuance. Mako’s presence as someone previously transformed provides a credible relational crucible without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched—his theatrical speech, history as an Emotional Auditor, and ritualized burning of journals create a vivid, particular psychology, and the woman’s numbness is efficiently but powerfully rendered (“eyes that had forgotten how to focus”). His motivation to “cultivate lightness in grief” coheres with his behavior and past. However, his internal conflict (guilt, complicity, self-justification) remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in live contradiction within the scene. The woman functions more as catalyst/recipient than as a full counter-presence with her own articulated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—her drive to “stride through boundaries once thought sacred” is embedded in both backstory and present action. Interiority is vivid and sensorial, but her emotional range stays largely in a single register of awed determination, with little contradicted impulse or genuine doubt under pressure. The realization that “the ban had never been external” is compelling but arrives somewhat as a told epiphany rather than something earned through on-page missteps or vacillation. Still, the final transformation feels motivated and aligned with her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motives (seeking color, bartering art, then accepting her grayscale vision) are clear and consistent, and Marin’s silence/reluctant re-engagement is well-motivated through actions rather than exposition. The botanical language and the trade for the furnace show meaningful, value-charged micro-choices. The internal conflict between Elara’s desire for cure and her latent appreciation of her own way of seeing is present but could be felt more in-scene rather than primarily revealed at the end. The final realization is earned but slightly rapid in emotional shading for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and specific—state-mandated healing versus her own suspicion that the system hides deeper truths—and her choice to strike the “damaged” pillar instead of reporting it feels well-earned by her background with imperfect crystals. Her interiority is concrete (the feel of the brass lens, the remembered prism-songs) and consistently tied to her vocation. The internal contradiction between following an algorithmic pilgrimage and improvising a heretical use of the lab is present but could be sharpened with a slightly clearer sense of fear or risk. The decision to remain in the Laboratory is evocative, though the emotional and practical cost of that renunciation is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is sharply etched—specific vocation, history of loss, and a quietly fervent mission—and her choices (inviting the young man in, guiding his ritual, continuing to fold cranes) track cleanly with that motivation. The young man is thinner but still credible, mostly a sounding board whose key turn is his recognition at the projected stars. Emotional states are embedded in setting and action rather than labeled, though internal conflict remains muted; Elara feels very resolved rather than actively torn. The enduring commitment at the end reads as an Earned Stasis with a visible cost that’s been paid prior to the scene but is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply etched—a methodical, intellectually driven skeptic-mystic whose cartomancy is essentially data science with ink—and her motivations (to quantify human patterns after algorithmic failure) are clear and consistent. Elias is thinner but serviceable as a foil: a hollowed-out believer seeking an explanatory framework rather than fortune. The micro-turn where Mara “confides” that the cards now show the past rather than the future is well-motivated and reveals an evolution in her stance rather than a convenient epiphany. Internal contradiction (her belief in method versus the occult framing she inherits) is present but mostly handled conceptually rather than through embodied emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The historian’s drive is clear, specific, and consistent, and her choices (researching for seventeen years, risking death by automata, embracing chaos) all stem convincingly from that obsession. “Anguished joy” is embodied rather than labeled, especially in the revelation and collapse. Internal contradiction (terror vs exultation, preservation vs desecration) is present but could be sharpened into more explicit, in-the-moment conflict. With no other human on the page, her psychology carries the whole piece and largely succeeds, but lacks one extra layer of lived messiness that would feel truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and specific from the outset (“to preserve the shape of hope”), and her choices—tracking the anomaly, reinterpreting the shadow, deciding to edit the footage gently—flow clearly from that. Her interiority is filtered through her vocation and imagery rather than therapy-speak, which keeps it particular. The internal shift from seeing the shadow as a parasite to recognizing it as metamorphosed hope feels earned, though her emotional contradiction under pressure could be shaded with a bit more friction or cost. Overall she reads as a distinct, competent, slightly ascetic figure whose actions align with her stated drive.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific, with her self-interrogation about complicity and gentleness vs. negligence feeling psychologically credible and earned. Concrete acts—removing gloves, apron, pendant; choosing to testify—externally manifest an internal shift. The contradiction between her desire to help and her enabling of harm is present throughout rather than tidily resolved. A few lines verge on analytic/therapy-speak abstraction, slightly smoothing over the messiness of real-time emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief, guilt, and obsessive need for “closure” are specific and consistent, and the surgeries/telepathy/backstory all read as extensions of that drive. His shift from trying to suture wounds to “witnessing” them is credible and seeded by the recurring scar imagery. However, his internal conflict mostly operates at the level of stated insight (“seeking closure had been the error”) rather than dramatized contradictory impulses in moment-to-moment choices, which slightly blunts the emotional impact. The sister is present only as an object of his quest, so relational pressure is conceptual rather than dynamically on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—“to find where unused love is stored”—and her interior lens (mapping emotions as architecture) feels distinctive. However, she encounters little genuine resistance or contradiction; her abilities work smoothly and there’s no real clash between conflicting impulses. Emotional states are largely described via extended metaphor rather than embodied stress, which keeps her at a slight conceptual distance. The final “cost” of carrying the knowledge feels more stated than dramatized in her body or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (freeing her blocked creativity) is clear, consistent, and rooted in specific history with her grandmother and her art. Interiority is vivid and embodied (the “hollowed chest,” the ache of motivation), and the final surrender to stillness feels earned by prior setup. Internal contradiction—terror vs surrender, control vs letting go—is present but relatively smooth, with little genuine friction or risk of refusal. The cost of change is more implied than sharply dramatized, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—guarding possibility and “cultivat[ing] the sparks in the unlit corners”—is clear and consistent, and his final acceptance of becoming a distributed sentinel is thematically apt. However, he is more emblematic than fully human; interior conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in choices where he might refuse or doubt. Emotional embodiment skews conceptual (duty, purpose) over visceral texture, which slightly blunts the cost of his transformation. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but feels preordained rather than wrestled for.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s characterization as a “stray philosopher” with a destabilizing sixth sense is vivid and coherent, with clear motives (avoid overwhelm, recover inner frontier) that plausibly evolve into acceptance. His embodied experiences (ache behind the eyes, clutching the gear) ground the abstraction. Internal conflict—retreat into interiority vs engagement with the forest—exists but is resolved rather quickly once the stranger appears. The epiphany about the sixth sense reads slightly tidy and articulated in thesis-like language rather than arising through messier, more conflicted scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s anxiety, dependence on Atlas, and emerging self-reliance are well-motivated and embodied (“panic she had spent years tethering to his steady breathing”), and her final refusal to re-leash him is a credible, earned shift. Interiority feels specific rather than generic, and the dawning realization that the search is for herself, not the dog, is grounded in the journey. The main limitation is that conflicting impulses under peak pressure (e.g., a sharper temptation to turn back) are more implied than dramatized, making the arc feel slightly tidy. The ferry guides are archetypal but effective as externalizations of internal guidance rather than rounded individuals, which fits the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bellhop’s inner life is specific and textured: his history with the Hush, nerve damage, and growing unease about the cost of silence all feel earned and consistent. His contradictory impulses—need for safety vs. hunger for music and meaning—are dramatized through concrete choices (showing the bolt to elders, returning to the staircase, ultimately re-hiding the evidence). The elders are sketched efficiently as a pressure source rather than ciphers, with their milky-eyed horror and throat-gestures clarifying stakes. The final stance—choosing to remain and keep the secret—is well motivated, though the emotional calculus is stated somewhat explicitly rather than fully embodied in that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The titan’s motivation and long preparation are clear and consistent, and his final refusal to claim the crown aligns with his established humility. However, we get almost no interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; he reads more as an archetype than a fully inhabited person. The pretender is effectively sketched but fairly stock (sneering, cruel, overconfident) with little nuance. The final choice—to walk away—lands, but its emotional cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt through his body or conflicted thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motives are clear, specific, and rooted in a long history with the reef and the atlas page; her combination of scientific rigor and unresolved grief feels individual rather than generic. The habit of tapping, her attachment to the inherited map, and her memory of the bleaching concretize interiority. The internal shift from treating the bleaching as an “endpoint” to seeing it as the beginning of social forgetting credibly motivates the closing act of sending the page to Manila. The conflict remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized against another will, which slightly limits the felt intensity of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply etched: barefoot, tactile, half-outsider academic, with a credible mix of awkwardness and conviction. Her motive—finding meaning in the rubble—is clear and carries through to the final stance. Internal experience is mostly embodied (teeth vibrating, grit under toes), though the internal conflict remains relatively low-key and could use one sharper contradictory impulse under pressure. The final repricing of her purpose feels earned by prior setup, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira is vivid and specific—a grandmother insurgent whose history, body, and tools all read as lived-in—and her motivation to break taboo aligns cleanly with her choices. Her plant-telepathy and insurgent past give her a distinct interior lens. The main limitation is that internal conflict is somewhat underplayed: she never seems genuinely tempted by preservation, so the cost of defying tradition feels more asserted than felt. A bit more contradiction or hesitation at the brink would deepen the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to survive and make meaning after the drone strike—is clear and consistently embodied through his tending of salt-resistant trees and his relationship to the photograph. The somatic detail (“trembling fingers, shallow breath, the taste of copper”) grounds his trauma in the body rather than abstractions. His internal shift from enduring to “deliberate act of cultivation” feels earned and carries cost. A slight weakness is the tendency to articulate his realizations in polished thesis statements rather than letting contradiction and confusion surface more messily.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s artistic burnout and need to “redesign the architecture of her perception” give her a coherent, compelling drive, and her choices (untangling threads, descending, filling the lamp) flow logically from that need. Interiority is vivid and particular, especially around her relationship to portraits and eyes, with embodied details like charcoal-stained fingers. However, her contradictions under pressure (fear vs. compulsion, ego vs. surrender) are more thematic than psychologically granular, so the final self-recasting reads slightly more mythic than hard-earned. A touch more concrete resistance or cost (hesitation, error, or selfish impulse) at the descent/lamp beats would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tracker’s motivation and long pursuit are clear and consistent, and his final decision to surrender his body to the ink is credibly earned by that obsession. “Serene anger” and his choice to be “consciously wild” give him a distinctive stance, but his interiority stays largely on a single note with limited contradictory impulses or real doubt. We don’t see him wrestle with the cost of dissolving so much as stride toward a preordained transformation, which slightly flattens his complexity. Still, his actions align with his worldview and create a meaningful before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s professional identity and oath vs. moral conscience are cleanly drawn, with embodied conflict (“her gloved hands trembled”) and a decisive, costly choice. Motivation is coherent and consistent from discovery to upload. What’s missing for a higher score is deeper particularity of flaw or history beyond her role—she reads more as an archetypal conscientious dissident than as a fully idiosyncratic person. The internal progression is convincing but thematically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s pacifist resolve, tactile rituals, and sensory-focused attention create a vivid, particular interiority, and her relationship to her father’s bounty-hunter legacy is sharply sketched through concrete objects (the pistol, the sandbags). However, she experiences little active internal contradiction in-scene; her pacifism is fully settled rather than tested, so the “choice” at the end feels more like restatement than hard-won turn. The Earned Stasis (continuing to garden despite impacts and a collapsing world) is credible but pays only a modest visible cost on the page. Strong character portrait, less strong character under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s want (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear and consistently pursued, and the rail spike as emotional conduit gives him some specificity. However, his interior conflict is muted; he rarely hesitates or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure. The “cool-headed fisher” detail is evocative but underused as a lived mindset or flaw. The final endurance—accepting that patterns can’t be mended, only witnessed—lands, but with relatively modest felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: she’s torn between loyalty to her family empire and her commitment to truth, and that tension credibly drives her to self-destructive honesty. Her devoted observational nature shapes how she approaches the problem (calculations, proof by contradiction) rather than melodramatic confrontation. The internal arc—from testing the journalist’s claim to accepting her inheritance as void and deciding to publish the correction—is clean and earned. The only mild limitation is that her struggle feels relatively smooth and controlled; we don’t see much real wavering or messy irrationality under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt, vocation, and specific coping mechanism (archiving lost sounds as penance) create a sharply etched, particular interior life, and her final choice to reach back and alter her younger self is well-motivated by those traits. The contradiction between the woman who fled and the woman who preserves extinction is present on the page and resolved in the closing act. The only slight limitation is that the younger Elara’s reversal happens very quickly, with the cost of abandoning twenty years of penance mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized in that instant.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and particular—whimsical chalk artist turned serious diagnostic ritualist—but her inner conflict stays relatively low-friction, with little sense of real risk or cost to her. The “socially perceptive” angle is nicely embodied in sensing the stone’s anxiety and the grotto’s loneliness. However, her emotional progression (unease → purpose → reverent awe) is smooth and tidy rather than genuinely pressured or ambivalent. The final recognition about the grotto’s loneliness feels earned but not deeply character-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific—the “gentle radical” with augmented limbs seeking “aberrant mercy” is distinctive and coherent. However, internal contradiction (steel vs empathy, witness vs erasure) remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in a pressured choice, since no one actively contests the renaming on the page. The retrocognitive burden evokes embodied emotion (visions, tightening trap), but we don’t see Kael seriously tempted to choose an easier or more conventional path. The final renaming reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Julian’s characterization as an encore-hungry yet ultimately altruistic ghost is vivid and coherent, and his shift from craving applause to craving “transfer of potential” feels earned. Mara is more archetypal—“shoulders curled like sheet music left in rain”—but her despair and tentative turn toward life are clear enough for this length. The interior contradiction lives more in Julian (artistic ego vs compassion) than in Mara, whose conflict is largely implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. Still, the final choice—her hand closing on the coin, leaving the box cutter—lands as a motivated change with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivations (skeptical but deeply empathetic, driven by responsibility and grief for her brother) are clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between disbelief in telepathy and belief in others’ pain is well dramatized. Her micro-choices—trusting the geode, continuing despite doubt, choosing to smile only at the end—track credibly. The final stance (connection without pills) feels earned, though the cost is largely conceptual rather than dramatized through a sharp, difficult choice. A slightly tidier emotional resolution than her contradictions might warrant keeps this just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—to become “the voice of the unknown” for hibernating humans—is clear and consistent, and their occupational lens (sensory map maker) shapes perception well. However, interiority leans declarative (e.g., “consuming motivation”) rather than dramatizing competing impulses or doubt, so they read more as a function than a fully fraught person. The key shift at the end (accepting the role they “had always intended”) lands but carries little visible cost or internal conflict. The piece could be stronger if Kael’s longing, loneliness, or ambivalence under that burden registered in concrete, contradictory reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, habits, and way of thinking are sharply particular (hourglass turner, button cataloger by “resonance”), and her shift from custodian to “seamstress of what might yet be” is motivated by the canyon echo and prophecy. Her competence and calm are convincing, but internal contradiction under pressure is muted—there’s little felt fear, doubt, or irrational tug against her ultimate choice. The seventeen-year backstory and her initial belief that prophecy is immutable give her arc a credible before/after, but the cost of that shift is more conceptual than emotionally dramatized. I wanted one sharper moment where her desire to preserve the old order fights with the risk of shattering the jar.

    Elena’s guilt, competence, and longing for repair are cleanly motivated and her final surrender of the chip tracks with those traits. However, her internal conflict is articulated more as reflection than as in-the-moment contradiction under pressure, and the confrontation with Marcus lacks frictive ambiguity or real relational risk. Marcus himself functions more as a steady narrative tool than as a full character exerting pressure. The “mended soul” at the end feels a touch tidy for the depth of trauma implied.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coachman’s vocation, vow, and method create a coherent inner life, and his micro-choices (waiting, mending, then deciding to cross) all align with his ethos. However, his emotional palette stays narrow—mostly a tranquil, monk-like patience—so we seldom feel contradictory impulses or genuine strain under that vow. The “palimpsest promise” is rich but functions more as concept than as a crucible that forces him into a visibly costly choice. The final decision to cross feels fitting but not sharply tested against any competing desire or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai’s motivation—to understand why this oasis resists change—is clear and persistent, and her micro-choices (journeying here, using the lantern glass, ultimately choosing non-interference) align with that drive. However, her interiority stays relatively serene and archetypal; there’s little contradictory impulse or visible emotional cost beyond contemplative awe. The “sharp gentleness” she practices is compelling but goes largely untested. The ending stance (to sit, learn, and leave the glass) feels credible but low-friction rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is sharply etched through concrete, vocationally specific memories (fire escape gardening, her father’s tools) and a clear value hierarchy of care over comfort. Motivation is lucid and consistent: transforming inherited grief and skill into an act of public guardianship. Internal conflict—between staying in the safe, tended garden and leaving to take on a lonely duty—is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in active doubt or misstep. The final endurance choice (staying until dawn, ensuring the beam holds) feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to transform crushing loneliness into a new kind of independence—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (“vibrated in her teeth,” the sundial warm in her hands), and the final renunciation of her “last fragile piece” feels earned. However, her internal conflict rarely operates as live contradiction in-scene; doubt and resistance are more summarized than dramatized. The epiphanic shift comes smoothly, without a strong moment where opposing impulses genuinely clash.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and particular—her long apprenticeship to others’ love and her paralysis around her own are clearly dramatized through concrete choices (descending the stairs, refusing to write more letters, building the nest). The shift from ghosting others’ hearts to risking exposure with Mara is well earned and feels like a genuine before/after. Internal conflict (safety in abstraction vs. desire to rejoin the living) is embedded in her actions rather than explained. Mara is sketched lightly but credibly as the specific locus of Elara’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motivation and competence are clear and specific—she’s a scientist using her expertise to counter the tricksters—and her fear versus determination under pressure reads credibly. We get embodied emotion (trembling hands, pressure at her temples), though her interior conflict remains relatively straightforward rather than deeply knotted. The final beat, with her exhausted but still committed to rebuilding, feels earned by prior choices. What holds this below top-tier is that her inner life is sketched rather than drilled into, with little morally fraught ambiguity or genuine flaw complicating her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s motivation (end winter hunger by retrieving the key) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her claustrophobia gives her a credible internal conflict. The embodied fear (tightening lungs, anticipation of walls on ribs) is specific, though it never quite degrades her judgment or causes a costly mistake. Her “prudently adventurous” patience is dramatized in the decision to wait for the walls to still rather than charge ahead. The final endurance—terror quieted but not erased by purpose—reads earned but could carry a sharper personal cost or unresolved flaw to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s paradoxical nature—face-blind portraitist, hyper-methodical yet emotionally frozen—is sharply drawn and consistently reflected in her choices. Her internal conflict between clinical detachment and the need for empathy is clearly dramatized in the shift of her drawing method. The final beat, where she feels the weight of the face she’s drawn, reads as an earned internal change rather than a forced epiphany. Secondary characters exist only off-page, but that narrow focus works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—rehabilitating Mara’s name via hard evidence—is clear, specific, and drives each choice from decoding to transmitting. Her “nervously confident” stance reads in action (trembling fingers, steady voice) without therapy-speak labels. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-grade; she never seriously considers silence or complicity, so the final stance feels more fulfillment than painful trade-off. Still, the character reads distinct, embodied, and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s guilt, superstition around music, and self-denial are clear and consistently dramatized, and his final choice to play again feels earned. Interiority is specific (the itch for silence, the way the glass warms, the bodily toll of playing until his fingers bleed). The inner conflict—self-punishing refusal vs. desire to re-engage his “bridge-song” art—is present on the page, not just asserted. A slightly sharper sense of his prior avoidance patterns in concrete scenes (rather than summary) would deepen the felt cost even more.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s lineage, class mobility, and self-deception about “escape” create a rich, specific interior conflict, and his final choice to leave at dawn feels earned by the prior pattern-recognition. The contrast between his boardroom “polished calm” and his current “perceptively calm” stance grounds motivation. Emotional embodiment leans a bit abstract at times, but his values and blind spots are clear and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s grief, vocation, and relationship with her brother are specific and convincing, and her micro-choices (coming to the observatory, pressing the petals to the dome, deciding to turn data into lullabies) align cleanly with those motives. Her interiority is vivid and character-particular, filtered through her dual roles as observer of dreams and of stars. The main limitation is that her internal conflict resolves with relatively little resistance; the epiphany feels smooth rather than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—from “warlike serenity” at the water’s edge to her calm refusal to bend inside the vortex—and her choices directly enact that ethos. The internal contradiction between guardedness and the eventual “unbent” sorrow is present but underplayed; she rarely feels in genuine danger of failing. Interiority is conveyed more through symbolic action and posture than messy thought, which keeps her compelling but slightly idealized. The final emotional shift to “simple peace” is earned but could carry more specific, embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to reach the intersection and repair time) is clear and embodied in her root-binding and pain, and Kael’s shared trauma and scars give their bond some depth. The anxious elation and fear are well-rendered in physical detail (roots tearing, scars heating) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is underused—there’s little visible hesitation or moral friction, and the emotional arc flows a bit too smoothly once Kael appears. The final commitment to “weave the new covenant” feels earned but light on visible personal cost beyond brief physical suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief and reckless idealism are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized, from burning the card years ago to willingly offering his life at the heart-tree. His interiority feels specific—“the mathematics of a heart that refused to accept subtraction” is character-particular rather than generic. The final endurance choice (accepting becoming part of the orchard rather than getting his sister back) is credibly earned. Emotional embodiment skews a bit abstract over visceral at peak beats, which slightly mutes the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is sharply drawn, with concrete contradictions—former roadie turned appraiser, craving certainty yet haunted by past failures—and his choice to prioritize mercy over precision at the end feels earned by the preceding interior struggle. The internal conflict between professional integrity and empathic recognition of the boy’s desperation is well dramatized rather than summarized. Emotional states are embodied via sound and tactile detail (the cloth’s weave, the singing quarry) rather than generic labels. The only minor limitation is that his final realization borders on tidy compared to the gritty, ambivalent texture of his memories.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivations (love for Arishti, intellectual obsession, need to understand transition) are clear and consistent, and his Assyriologist mindset grounds his choices. The final renunciation—accepting that to understand the journey he must complete it—is credibly foreshadowed. Internal contradiction (desire for knowledge vs implicit self-preservation) is present but underplayed; he moves fairly smoothly toward dissolution without much on-page resistance. Still, his interiority feels particular and embodied through his relationship to texts and tools rather than stock emotion labels.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The titan-gear librarian is specific and memorable, with a clear, consistent drive to preserve the migrating identities. However, it functions more as an archetypal custodian than a fully conflicted character; its internal contradictions are mostly thematic rather than dramatized as simultaneous impulses under pressure. The identities’ resistance gives it something to negotiate with, but we rarely feel its own doubt or emotional cost in the work. The endurance at low strength is evocative, yet the choice to proceed never feels in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific, with a clear contradiction between professional duty (reporting/demolition) and her visceral pull toward preserving and transforming this space. Her realization that she’s always “carried the weight of abandoned hopes” credibly motivates the final betrayal of her role. The hesitation over the delete key and the choice to crown the stalagmite both feel earned and value-driven. A minor softness is that her lifelong drive “to dissolve the walls between hearts” is articulated a bit explicitly rather than left fully in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied, with her river-chronicler mind and guilt over her sister tightly driving her choices. The contradictory impulses—seeking unmedicated clarity vs. the danger of that flood—are present in how she navigates the station and the graffiti. Her decision to return to the accident site tomorrow feels earned by the accumulated sensory and emotional pressure. The only minor limitation is that the “dam” insight borders on neatness, slightly smoothing what could be a messier moral knot.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dreamer’s motivation (seeking the library for seventeen years, tied to her mother’s unuttered goodbye) is clear and consistent, and her cautious excitement reads as particular. However, internal contradiction and true pressure on her psyche are underdeveloped; she rarely feels genuinely torn or degraded by stress. Her key “choice” to accept the archivist role feels more like a gentle realization than a fraught decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: career/safety vs truth/beauty is dramatized in concrete choices, not just told, and her plant-telepathy + coffee divination feel integral rather than gimmicky. The internal conflict peaks cleanly in the “dream against an empire” paragraph and resolves through a costly act (destroying the violin). We see a coherent hierarchy of values—she sacrifices institutional success for a more precarious, covert resistance. The only small limitation is that we don’t glimpse many non-professional facets of her life, so her world feels narrowly calibrated to this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and professional focus are clear and specific, and her competence in this ritualized work feels convincing. However, her emotional life is narrow: we see devotion, reverence, and a hint of terror at oblivion, but no real contradiction or resistance that complicates her actions. The line “simple and terrible” suggests a darker edge that never fully manifests in on-page conflict. The closure reads more like a beautifully executed routine than a pressured choice with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation and inner life are clear and particular: a centuries-long, post-forgiveness restlessness focused through his role as caretaker and his attachment to the hairpin. His final choice—to bury the pin—flows convincingly from his cumulative reflections and the present-tense ritual he performs. The internal conflict is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through sharp contradictory impulses on the page, so his shift reads smooth rather than hard-won. Still, the arc from penance to peaceful participation feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and paradoxical in a way that feels earned rather than slogan-like, especially the tension between being “sincerely insincere” and his growing discomfort with that role. His choice to unhook and discard the cloak is clearly motivated by accumulated burden and the cartographer’s toxic certainty, and it forecloses an easier path. Emotional states are mostly embodied through objects and setting (cloak weight, shard biting his mouth) rather than abstract labels. A slight tendency toward declarative self-definition (“He was a fraud who believed in his fraudulence”) keeps this just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The backward-aging researcher is specific, embodied, and psychologically coherent; his regression of memory and certainty is a strong, character-particular engine. His choices—to cast the stone, select and withhold ripples, and reframe his “curse” as methodology—arise cleanly from his motives and situation. The internal contradiction between clinging to knowledge and accepting unknowing is present, though it could be dramatized with slightly more friction rather than only articulated. The final acceptance of vanishing feels earned and carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The skimmer’s motive—to learn to navigate without moving—is clear and sustained, and his historically reverent patience is well embodied in images like dust crusting his shoulders. However, emotional texture stays largely conceptual; we see little contradictory impulse on the page beyond liberation vs. further anchoring in the dust. His final endurance choice (to become landmark/arrowhead) is earned but not deeply dramatized as a painful renunciation. This keeps the character compelling but short of fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s underperformance within an automated system and his attraction to imperfection are clearly established and drive his choices toward the keystone and ultimate renunciation. His interiority is specific and character-particular, especially in how he reads the lingering luminance and crooked masonry as “sacred in the simple.” The final choice to become part of the spire’s forgotten architecture feels earned by his long-standing misfit with efficiency metrics. Internal contradiction (safety versus yearning) could be embodied more viscerally under peak pressure, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply sketched through role, inheritance, and obsession, and his choices (staying after the horn, descending to the wreck, striking the tuning fork) track cleanly with that motivation. The emotional palette is more atmospheric than psychologically contradictory, so we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull beyond a solemn sense of duty and curiosity. His grandmother’s influence and the long night-shift endurance give him some depth without becoming therapy-speak. The final realization about his twelve years of “wandering purposefully” feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s role and motivation are clear—she must choose the wavelength that will relaunch the universe—and her internal tension between “stellar doubt” and a kind of disciplined faith is well realized. Her competence and ritualized method (coins, receiver) give her specificity beyond a generic chosen-one. However, the emotional life stays mostly in abstract/philosophical registers rather than embodied, so she reads more as a function and symbol than as a fully particular human. The final choice feels consistent and motivated, but its cost to her as a person is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reaper’s grief, paralysis, and eventual redefinition of his role are clear, specific, and consistent, and his motives (love, loss, refusal to harvest) convincingly drive his presence in the observatory. His emotional life is rendered with concrete images (the scythe as a “companion in his grief,” touching the crystal leviathan) rather than labels. The main limitation is that most of his change is contemplative rather than enacted under sharp on-page pressure; contradictory impulses are implied more than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. Still, the final stance—enduring as witness rather than collector—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization as a “lukewarm” mage with brittle devotion is specific and consistent, and her limitation-driven tactics (precision over power) align tightly with that. Her internal tension between naive hope and “certain knowledge that miracles did not happen for mediocre mages” reads as a real contradiction rather than a slogan. Emotional experience is mostly embodied via action (counting drops, trembling fingers) instead of labels. The main ceiling is that her inner conflict never forces a sharply different possible choice on the page—she doubts but never truly considers stopping or choosing another path.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a meticulous, aging warden with a generational connection to the drowned town, and his moral awakening is clearly rooted in his history and temperament. His reactions to the photos and label are concrete and particular, not stock. The main weakness is that his internal conflict—between longtime institutional role and emergent dissident archivist—is stated more than dramatized, making his “sudden clarity” feel slightly neat rather than fully wrestled-with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation—bridging logic and intuition—is clear, consistent, and shaped by a concrete history of “formulae and combustion” contrasted with suppressed “wild knowing.” Her contradictory impulses (rigid methodology vs. secret sentimentality/wonder) are embodied in choices like bringing the worn wooden horse and finally using it as an offering. The internal change at the end (redefining the philosopher’s stone as a state of being) is credibly earned by what precedes. The only limit is that the transformation comes with minimal resistance or cost beyond relinquishing an old worldview, so the emotional crucible feels relatively gentle for this level of epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s competence, embodied fear, and history as a former jumper create a credible, specific professional psyche under strain. Her motivation to protect Kael and uphold trust is clear and governs her choices. However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched—she rarely wavers or frays—so the “watcher’s burden” never quite sharpens into a conflicted, costly inner dilemma. Kael himself is largely a function at the end rather than a full relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and specific, with a convincing contradiction between “vacancy where identity collapsed” and a buried drive to defeat numbness. Her key choices—rejecting, then synthesizing with, the clone—are well motivated by this fracture. Embodiment peaks in the weeping moment, though earlier stretches lean a bit abstract in describing her state. The final blended identity feels earned and visibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s core drive—to escape derivative industry conventions and safeguard innovation—is clear and consistent, and her professional mindset feels specific to an escape room designer. However, most of her struggle is asserted rather than dramatized; we’re told about commercial pressures and creative suffocation but never see a concrete, risky choice or live pushback. Interiority is conceptually rich but leans into manifesto rather than contradiction under pressure. The late transformation into “curator of liminal experiences” lands, but with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief, regret, and eccentricity are clear and particular, from being the “leaf blower symphony conductor” to his fixation on the pull cord as instrument of repair. His core motivation—to restore his family’s laughter—remains consistent and drives every action. Internal conflict (regret vs. hope) is present but mostly expressed through concept-language rather than fully embodied contradiction. Still, his final renunciation (letting the handle dissolve as he fades) feels earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The guardian’s internal conflict between dimensional homesickness and the pull of remaining “undefined” is clear, specific, and drives her choices. Her micro-choices—taking the pendant, practicing interiorizing exteriors, ultimately refusing the call home—are all motivated and consistent with her feral yet maternal nature. Contradictory impulses are present in-scene (longing for home vs. attraction to the in-between) rather than summarized abstractly. The only limitation is that emotional struggle stays at a cool, conceptual distance, rarely tipping into truly raw or risky embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus reads as a specific, coherent person: a long-term failure who nonetheless persists with almost desperate rigor, and his motive “to interrupt a stifling destiny” cleanly drives his actions. His hopelessness and stubborn hope sit side by side, especially in the history of failed experiments versus his continued return to the ember nexus. Emotional texture is mostly embedded in perception and action rather than labels, which keeps him from feeling generic. The main limit is that his internal conflict (fear of meaninglessness vs. drive to transform) could surface in one or two sharper, embodied micro-choices to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation (to reinterpret the hush and prove beginnings in endings) is clear, consistent, and tied to her professional identity, and her choices under pressure (rejecting protocol, inverting gain) feel grounded in that trait. Interiority is specific—“fantasy practicality,” calm professionalism at lethal stakes—but her emotional life remains relatively streamlined, with little on-page ambivalence or fear despite her predecessor’s death. The final vindication lands more as clean success than as a costly or internally conflicted shift. Character complexity is strong for the length but stops short of truly layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are sharply defined, and his actions consistently follow from his sense of duty and “resiliently positive” outlook. His agency is clear in using the hourglass and radio to guide passengers, giving him a competent, grounded presence. However, internal contradiction is limited—he rarely feels genuinely torn, frightened, or overwhelmed, which flattens emotional depth. The final shift into being a liminal ferryman is earned but could carry more visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her final surrender into the architecture grows logically from her role as “fever dream architect.” However, her interior conflict remains mostly conceptual; we rarely feel contradictory impulses or embodied fear around the cost of becoming the medium, so the emotional turn at the end is more idea-driven than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation—translating old navigational mastery into survival in a broken cosmos—is clear, consistent, and made particular through her history with the drowned surface and the anchor link. Her emotional texture (grief, duty, awe) is embodied rather than labeled, especially in the beats where she sights Vega and feels “somber marvel.” Internal contradiction (refuge vs expansion, nostalgia vs necessity) is present but remains mostly conceptual rather than pushed into a painful on-page dilemma. The final choice to send an expedition is earned, though its personal cost is more implied than dramatized in her behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s vocation, ethic (“protect vulnerable voices”), and professional habits are specific and consistently dramatized through her micro-choices—coming alone, descending without backup, focusing on the hearing aid under pressure. Her emotional state is embodied rather than labeled, and the shift from bureaucratic evidence-gatherer to rescuer reads earned. Thomas is understandably thinner but still registers as a person, not a prop, in his brief on-page time. The main limitation is that her internal conflict at the moment of choosing to go down alone is underplayed; fear and doubt could be richer there.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradiction—claustrophobic spelunker drawn back to a site of extreme confinement—feels rich and specific, and her motivation “to stand by the unremembered” is clear and drives her return. Interiority is concrete (“her claustrophobia screaming”) and her final shift as that fear “peaked, then shattered” is convincingly earned. A few labels (“Her particular neurosis made her perfect for this work”) skate close to diagnostic shorthand rather than fully dramatized contradiction, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives (reclaiming her erased self, understanding the algorithm’s decision) are clear and consistently embodied through concrete habits like counting her pulse and using the shard as an anchor. Her internal conflict—terror of erasure versus desire to merge with the ghost and know the truth—plays out credibly in the ink-work and final willingness to stop counting. The closing shift from compulsive verification to trust feels earned by the preceding beats. A slight weakness is the somewhat declarative articulation of her “anomaly” status, which flirts with authorial summary rather than purely dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she wants to save a dying language by neutralizing a curse— and her tactics follow logically from that aim. However, her interior conflict is underdeveloped: we’re told the stakes are immense, but we don’t feel competing impulses or real fear of losing her own voice or life. Emotional responses are mostly embedded in description, not embodied as strain or contradiction under pressure. The final dimming of her copper veins gestures at cost but isn’t deeply prepared as a personal dilemma rather than a plot consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation (to alchemize grief and bitterness into cosmic laughter) is clear and consistently dramatized, and her metamorphosis into the cryptid grows logically from that drive and the Marcus backstory. Interiority is specific and embodied (“bones becoming lighter than regret,” the arrowhead burning against her ribs) rather than generic. What keeps this below top-tier is the relative lack of on-page contradiction or resistance in her internal process; once the ritual begins, she mostly flows with it, so the cost of relinquishing her human life isn’t as contested moment-to-moment as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to reawaken wildness and wonder—feels specific and consistent, and her choices (risking the statues, using the locust shell, escalating the music) align cleanly with that drive. The embodied beats (bow trembling, pulse in the shell, bridge swaying) ground her interiority. However, lines like “insurgent of beauty” gesture toward a slightly abstract, thesis-like self-conception rather than fully dramatized inner contradiction or moral ambiguity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marek’s motives and values are clear and consistent—his insistence on physical mail, his mercy toward drones, and his sacrifice of three months’ rations all ring specific. However, his interiority skews declarative and thematic rather than conflicted in-scene; we seldom see contradictory impulses truly collide under pressure. The emotional relationship to specific recipients (especially the woman and her son) is mostly summarized, which softens the impact of that crucial letter. His final stance feels like an earned endurance, but the cost is more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—recovering a lost carousel magic/voice through deep listening—is clear, consistent, and nicely rooted in his craft. His interiority is specific (wood grain, wind, heartbeats) rather than generic, and his final reframing of silence feels earned by those thirteen years. The main limitation is that internal conflict remains relatively soft; we don’t feel much simultaneous resistance or fear alongside the awakening. The change is convincing and has cost, but the piece doesn’t fully mine his contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation—to reawaken her grandmother’s dormant story—is clear, specific, and rooted in the scarf and her work in the library. Her interiority is convincingly colored by math, memory, and custodial duty, giving her a distinct sensibility. However, the emotional conflict is relatively one-directional; we seldom see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. As a result, her final smile and sense of completion feel earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing and vocation are clear and particular, and her motivation (to reclaim the runaway dream and fill the hollow in her chest) coherently drives every choice. However, her interiority skews declarative and unified—there’s little genuine contradiction or doubt once the goal is set, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion shows up in touches like her trembling fingers and tuning-fork ribs, but it remains largely in the same tonal register. The final choice to vitalize the dream “not to possess it, but to return it” feels consistent but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vey’s motivation (honoring the poet, freeing the idea) is clear and consistent, and her competence fits the mythic frame. However, she faces little real internal contradiction or visible emotional struggle; she never seems truly torn or at risk. Her “enigmatic” quality stays surface-level—evocative but not deeply dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and particular—thirty years of muddy, field-based obsession to recover her sister’s stolen self—and her final shift from observer to actor feels earned. Her profession, habits, and values are tightly woven into her choices in the scene. Internal contradiction (fear vs. duty, or grief vs. professional detachment) is present but lightly sketched rather than fully dramatized under peak pressure, which keeps this just short of truly exceptional characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid, specific, and consistent, with concrete quirks (walking backwards, ritualized tea readings) that manifest under pressure rather than feeling decorative. Her motivation—to force growth through “cruelest kindness”—is clearly dramatized in how she alternates threat (the hammer) and protection (delaying the shattering). The child-shadow is necessarily thinner but still registers as an anxious, responsive presence with a clear desire to avoid pain. The final choice to walk forward with the child feels earned by the gradual lessening of her backward steps, though her own backstory remains suggestive rather than deeply excavated.

    Elian’s motivation and vocation are vivid and coherent, and his actions track clearly with his goal of preserving wonder, but his inner life under pressure is sketched more in archetypal terms than in specific, contradictory impulses. The line “insatiably creative, forever inventing new grafts” gives him texture, yet he never truly doubts, falters, or reveals a sharp flaw that complicates the climax. His exhaustion at the end provides a modest sense of cost and endurance, but the arc feels more like a fulfilled role than a transformed person. This keeps the characterization strong but short of deeply novel or conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s characterization is rich and specific: a restorer who deliberately broke her own mask and uses her damage as a tool gives her a compelling, coherent psychology. Her motives—grounding spirits, accepting their silence into her fractures—are clear and enacted through concrete choices. Internal contradiction is present (she came here to die yet chooses to become the net) but could surface more dynamically in-scene rather than mostly as stated backstory. The final endurance choice feels earned and carries cost, but the emotional struggle en route is more stated than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s professional mindset and motivation are clear and specific—her sensitivity to hidden intentions in maps nicely grounds her later choices. However, she encounters minimal genuine internal conflict or competing impulses; she never seriously weighs whether she should expose or protect what she finds. Her competence is persuasive, but the lack of visible emotional cost or contradiction at the climax keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Julian’s calmly analytic, death-familiar worldview is distinct and consistent, and his motive to decode endings through “physics” is clear. However, his emotional conflict stays largely conceptual; we don’t see much in-the-moment struggle or contradictory impulse beyond quiet reverence. The relationship with Death is evocative but functions more as framing and mentorship than as a crucible that forces a specific hard choice. His final internal shift toward understanding surrender feels earned but relatively smooth, with limited felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to give voice to unspoken needs and to free/complete the ghost—is clear and consistent, and her actions (retrieving the plate, encoding the final message, choosing to leave) align cleanly with it. However, she operates with very little visible internal contradiction or real ambivalence; the story doesn’t force her into a genuinely difficult trade-off. Her isolation is told and implied via “seldom-heard” rather than dramatically tested. The ending choice to move on lands, but it feels gentle rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is rendered with specific, embodied curiosity (her handling of the goggles and diary, her attention to tiny sensual details like the taste of altitude coffee) and her core motivation—to understand interior lives—is consistent and plausible. The key change, her re-seeing of the captain from tragic gossip to “cartographer of dualities,” is well-earned by the reading sequence. Internal conflict is relatively low-intensity (there’s little pushback from fear, duty, or taboo), so the cost of her stance shift remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatically pressured. Still, for this scope, the characterization is deep, particular, and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with her cloud-emotion taxonomy and fixation on the broken tether revealing a distinct psyche under pressure. Her motivation—to reframe the break and memorialize absence—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices like knotting the twine instead of focusing on rescue. The shift from fear/attachment to acceptance feels earned through accumulative reflection. There’s mild idealization (near-total composure under life-threatening conditions), but it doesn’t break plausibility at this lyrical distance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—capturing the exact gradient of dawn before demolition—and her actions (retrieving pigments, climbing, painting, then leaving without looking back) all align with that drive. Her perceptual quirks (face blindness, tactile/“fractal” vision) are well integrated into how she thinks, chooses, and remembers. There is some internal tension—urgency vs. the patience and precision her craft demands—but it could be sharpened into a more active inner conflict. The closing endurance choice (to walk away carrying the sky internally) feels earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity, solitude, and professional mindset are clearly motivated and consistently expressed, and her choice to work through the night and reset the ship’s course grows credibly from those traits. However, internal contradiction and real emotional cost are underdeveloped—her “sociable isolation” never seriously clashes with the burden of being chosen for such a discovery. The piece leans more on competence and wonder than on flawed, pressured humanity. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet deep enough for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, concrete, and sustained—from the village’s frozen sky-clock to her quest for the “rhythm of repair”—and her competence feels earned through tactile engagement with the gears. However, she encounters little real resistance, and her emotional life is more one-note determination than layered contradiction. The realization that repair is about “listening to what the metal wanted to become” is thematically apt but arrives with minimal prior internal friction. The shift from desperate seeker to “keeper of rhythms” is convincing but could carry more visible cost or conflicted feeling on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivations are clear and consistent—protect the settlement, make sense of Thomas’s messages—but her interiority is sketched rather than deeply contoured, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The line about “the timeframe of after strangers become family” is evocative but not fully dramatized through specific frictions or micro-choices. Thomas as a ghost reads as morally pure and one-note, which flattens potential complexity. The final shift—Mara accepting the haunting as love and taking up the bell—is earned but emotionally a touch too smooth for the scale of what’s implied.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to grant the universe a merciful, lullaby-soft ending—is clear and consistently expressed through her choices (placing the puppet, beginning the song, staying with the mechanism). Her interiority is evocative but largely thematic and abstract; we get little concrete, contradictory emotional texture beyond reverent duty and tenderness. Lines like “In that bruised awe of final moments, she finally understood that endings could be acts of profound love rather than defeat” risk feeling like pre-packaged realization rather than a struggle arrived at in-scene. Still, her endurance and final acceptance read as an earned stasis with a real cost: her own dissolution alongside the universe.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s reluctance, competence, and guilt (especially the memory of her brother’s bones) give her a specific, embodied psychology, and her sighing complaint paired with meticulous work feels human. Her motivation to protect travelers despite resenting the role is clear and consistently dramatized. Internal contradiction is present but could be deepened by showing more moment-to-moment doubt or temptation to walk away at peak pressure. The final recommitment to her vigil is earned but lands more as confirmation than a sharp new internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and grounded in her chemist mindset, with grief, guilt, and intellectual curiosity intertwining in a character-particular way. Her micro-choices—descending to the waterline, tracing foam, handling the chrysalis, opening the notebook—track cleanly with her stated motive to “atone” and to translate separation into connection. The final shift from constricted grief to a reconfigured understanding of divergence is earned by these observations and reflections. The main limitation is that her internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly, with relatively little on-page resistance or backsliding at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to find where stories begin despite the limits of her parole—is clear and coherently drives her choices, especially the final renunciation of her role as vendor. Her interiority is particular (she thinks in measurements and absences), but emotional textures remain mostly conceptual rather than embodied. The internal conflict between safety (parole) and transgression (stepping through) is present but could be sharpened with more visceral hesitation or fear at the threshold. Still, the final transformation into “the silence between words” feels earned by the preceding pattern of thought and action.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is vivid and particular—she’s driven by secondhand remorse and the desire to “sandpaper” it down—and her backstory (gloves, isolation, profession) cleanly underpins this. Her interiority is sensorial and character-specific, especially in how she experiences emotion as taste. However, she faces little visible internal contradiction in the present scene; once she decides to enact the pavilion’s process, there is no real hesitation or competing impulse. The final change to steadier hands and glove-free touch feels earned but almost too tidy, with the cost of absorbing “ton after ton” of regret underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, but she reads more like an emblematic figure than a fully contradictory human being: resolute, competent, and almost entirely without evident doubt or selfishness. Moments like “trembling but resolute arms” gesture toward embodiment, yet her internal conflict never meaningfully complicates the ritual. The 17-year preparation is stated but not dramatized as a source of pressure or ambivalence. The final success feels aligned with her goals but comes without a visible personal cost or sacrifice beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s motivation—rewriting her own and the city’s “abandoned dreams”—is clear and consistent, and the mirror-focused micro-choices track with that drive. However, her emotional life is heavily abstracted into conceptual language (“synaptic pathways,” “quantum-knotted”) with little concrete, embodied feeling, which blunts specificity. Internal contradiction (fear vs. desire, doubt vs. certainty) is barely dramatized; she mostly seems serenely committed to the procedure. The final change into a “living archive” is conceptually earned but not strongly felt as a costly, personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering the forgotten combinations she once protected—is clear and consistent, and the prism-minded archivist lens gives her perception some individuality. However, her interiority leans conceptual rather than emotionally embodied, so we rarely feel specific fear, guilt, or doubt in her body as she moves through real danger. The most interesting character fact—that she seeded the vigilance herself—is stated rather than dramatized through conflict or regret. Her final choice to pocket a seed promises future complexity but doesn’t yet register as a costly or morally fraught decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, sensory focus, and reverence for the alder give her a clear, particular interior life, and her motivation to coax sound from trauma is consistent and legible. Her micro-choices (waiting for the hedgehog, tracing fissures, calibrating pressure) arise naturally from her traits. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper internal contradiction or visible cost beyond awe and tears; she rarely wavers or struggles emotionally. The final shift—she succeeds and weeps—is earned but relatively low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Castian’s inner life is rich and specific—his exile, regret over refusing to sacrifice the queen, and changed relationship to silence all feel earned and character-particular. His motivation to reconcile precision with feeling tracks clearly into the final choice to move pieces along “impossible” paths. The main limitation is that we see little contradictory impulse in the present moment (no strong tug back toward old habits), so the change feels more contemplative than embattled.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elio’s motivation and vocation are vivid and specific, and his actions—tuning the clasp, cataloging silences—align cleanly with them. However, he faces little real internal conflict or contradiction; he mostly enacts a fully formed worldview. The closing realization about forgiveness extends rather than complicates his prior stance, so the cost of his pacifism remains largely conceptual. Strong presence, but not yet the psychologically knotted interiority top venues look for.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s ambition, sensory gift, and lineage are clearly and consistently motivating her choices, from the three-year quest to the gentle planting and commitment to return daily. Her internal conflict—wanting the extraordinary bloom while dreading its stench—is credible and thematically aligned, especially in the realization that endurance itself is a form of medicine. Interiority is specific (olfactory parsing, bodily steadiness on swaying bridges) rather than generic, though a few abstractions (“emotional architecture of her ambition”) skim toward summary. The final stance—choosing to endure future suffering for growth—feels earned, if relatively low-intensity in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s professional motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her realization about resilience emerges plausibly from what she witnesses. However, her interiority stays relatively narrow—there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine doubt under pressure, so the arc feels more like a smooth enlightenment than a fraught change. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual (understanding, realization) more than visceral in peak beats. This limits how deeply we feel the cost of her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s competence, professional mindset, and underlying grief for Chen are clear and specific, especially through her handling of the patch and her clinical attention to wind data. Motivation (understand the catastrophe to prevent the next) is strong and coherent. However, her emotional life stays largely in the conceptual register, with limited embodied contradiction or on-page struggle under pressure, which slightly flattens her as a fully dimensional character. The final smile under the respirator gestures toward complexity but isn’t deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and specific—“to certify wonder as essential” against a ticking political deadline—and her role as prism-song bell ringer feels lived-in. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradiction; she’s almost purely a vessel of purpose, which flattens potential complexity. Her embodied experience is well-rendered through synesthetic perceptions, but less through concrete, idiosyncratic thought. The final collapse reads as physical cost rather than a deepened or conflicted internal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s guilt-driven motivation and dogged need to “harvest insights from failure” are clear and consistently dramatized through her actions with the flute and driftwood. The story effectively contrasts her past hesitation with present precision, creating a credible internal arc from paralysis to craft. However, her current-state inner conflict feels relatively resolved from the outset, so contradictory impulses under pressure are more remembered than live on the page. This slightly mutes the sense of a difficult, costly choice in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to derive an equation for emotion—is specific, consistent, and clearly drives her choices, especially the ruthless use of the cartographer. However, her inner conflict (intellectual hunger vs. the cost of destroying others) remains more implied than dramatized, and the cartographer is more an elegant function (rigid mind to be broken) than a fully individuated person. The final turn—him becoming “another font”—is thematically sharp but slightly underprepared emotionally in terms of her own felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is cleanly drawn as anxious, observant, and shaped by Maren’s teachings, and his decision to break the courier’s code by lingering with the archivist feels rooted in those traits. The interiority is particular enough (jitteriness, fixation on overlooked details) to avoid genericness. However, his transformation from “jittery courier” to calm myth-maker is stated more than dramatized under real pressure, so the cost of that shift feels somewhat low-friction. I don’t see strong contradictory impulses playing out in-scene; doubt and duty never clash as hard as they could.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to prove her theory about objects absorbing emotion—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice in the scene. Her interiority is particular enough (austere empiricism applied to mysticism) but leans more archetypal than deeply contradictory, with little sense of genuine risk beyond shaken doubt. The final shift—from skeptic of “truthful lies” to believer in “honest magic”—is earned but emotionally smooth, without much visible cost beyond trembling and awe. Strong, but not yet at the level of knotted, high-stakes interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s longing and motivation are vivid and specific—her decades of collecting amber and the captured “final laughter” give her goal weight, and her final self-unraveling is a motivated extension of this obsession. Interiority is mostly carried through action and image rather than explicit thought, which works but leaves some of her contradictory impulses more implied than dramatized. The progression from wistful to “translucent and terrible” reads as an earned endurance/sacrifice. A bit more in-the-moment conflict (hesitation, doubt) at the point of self-unraveling could deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore the orchards and planetary balance—is clear and consistently rooted in her meek-but-stubborn temperament, with her blacksmith’s precision anchoring her choices. Her interiority is concrete enough (trembling fingers, the unwavering line of her shoulders) to feel particular rather than generic. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradictory impulses: once she commits, we don’t see real hesitation or morally ambiguous trade-offs. Her final shift from “meek blacksmith” to “quiet architect of return” is earned but lands more as affirmation than as a hard-won, conflicted change.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding her mentor’s withheld truth—is clear and consistent, and her final stance (choosing understanding over revision) is earned by the accumulation of sensory and ethical data. However, her emotional life remains relatively abstract and unembodied; we get little concrete contradiction or messy, in-the-moment conflict (e.g., grief vs. anger vs. awe) as she uncovers each fragment. The mentor relationship is powerful in concept but stays largely summarized rather than dramatized in specific memories or sensory echoes. This keeps her from fully crossing into the most vivid, particularized characterization tier.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and convincing—her comfort with ghosts, preference for currents over speech, and need for anonymity all cohere into a distinct psyche whose choices drive the piece. The central decision not to add her letter and instead seal the sea glass is motivated and carries a quiet cost, foreclosing a more direct connection. Internal contradiction exists (yearning for contact vs. need for protective distance) but is held mostly in description rather than dramatized in sharp, in-scene friction. A touch more enacted struggle at the peak choice would push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s central motive—to steer the dawn away from oblivion and preserve tactile memory—is clear and consistent, and his “shadowed elation” gives him a distinctive emotional color. However, his interiority is largely mono-directional; we don’t see much contradiction or real doubt as he works, so the cost of his commitment feels more declared than dramatized. Micro-choices (how he uses the wick, when he releases the beam) align with his role but don’t expose a deep internal struggle. The final endurance—continuing the routine with “tomorrow’s shadows”—reads as earned but not particularly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dye master’s interiority is rich, embodied, and specific, with the new heart and fear of heights giving her a textured contradiction between fragility and authority. Her motivation—to understand the donor’s narrative magnetism before the heart “claims” her—is clear and drives each micro-choice (tracking sun trails, repositioning the wing, finally releasing it). The emotional turn from terror and alienation to acceptance and porousness reads earned rather than declarative. If anything, the piece sits so squarely in reflective mode that relational or external friction is minimal, slightly limiting the range of on-page pressure on her character.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand what the trees have witnessed—is clear, consistent, and drives every major choice, especially her decision to deconstruct the sorrow-storage system. Her interiority is textured and particular (“maintenance itself was a form of gardening”), though the emotional progression is relatively smooth, with limited felt contradiction or resistance. The epiphany after the badge falls is persuasive but a bit neat, lacking visible struggle or self-doubt at the moment of change. Still, she reads as an individuated consciousness rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling—rekindle a dying realm—and her actions (singing, weaving, swaddling light) align tightly with it. However, interiority is largely mythic and declarative rather than embodied, so we rarely feel her fear, doubt, or contradictory impulses. Her “scattered selves” are conceptually rich but function more as image than as a source of on-page tension in her choices. The final wholeness lands, but the emotional cost of getting there is gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a compassionate recluse whose empathy and fear of contact are in constant tension, and his final tactic (opening the way but remaining hidden) feels earned by his established traits. The mirroring between his past loneliness and the young woman’s present need grounds his motivation. Emotional experience is sometimes rendered in abstract language rather than concrete embodiment, which keeps this just shy of fully immersive interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular—“creeping normality noticer” and finding the sacred in dough and soil give her a distinct inner logic. Her actions (guerrilla gardening, preserving and then transforming the bread) track well with those motives. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she operates with calm certainty rather than tension. Secondary characters are lightly but effectively sketched, serving more as a chorus than as active pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to witness and preserve the last echoes of human vows—is clear, consistent, and woven into her professional identity as orderly records chief. Her procedural discipline versus rising despair provides a credible internal tension, especially when the Fading accelerates and she pushes herself to work faster while remaining precise. However, her emotions stay mostly in a refined, cerebral register; a touch more embodied contradiction under peak pressure could deepen her specificity. The final endurance—accepting that witnessing is all she can do—feels earned and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply motivated and tactically active; her devotion to her father, competence, and use of “silence as ammunition” all feel specific and grounded. Her micro-choices—false starts, feigned drunkenness, exposing the fob as bait—track cleanly with her goal. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or emotional cost beyond competent tension; she rarely feels truly at risk of wavering. Secondary characters are thin but functional as pressure rather than people.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s skepticism, sensory way of knowing, and luminous doubt give her a distinct interiority, and the final pivot—doubt becoming function—feels motivated by what’s come before. However, her internal conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized through hard choices; she never has to risk anything tangible or choose against a strong counter-impulse on the page. The weather-bearers function more as archetypal forces than individuated people, which limits relational pressure. The result is strong, memorable characterization with a somewhat soft, low-friction arc.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her mnemonic curse, resentment at tourist caricature work, and shame over breaking the lock all cohere into a clear, driving motivation. Her final choice to abandon the surface world feels earned by prior frustration and longing for “true art.” The main limitation is that her internal conflict at the end tilts slightly tidy—there’s little on-page resistance or ambivalence about leaving everything behind, which would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aurelia’s motivation is clear and consistent—recovering lost conversations to heal the city—and her choices (following the map, confronting Marcus, opening the vault, deciding to transcribe) all arise from that drive. Interiority is present but somewhat thin; we get very little contradictory impulse or fear about what she might find or what it might cost her. The calligrapher detail is vivid but not deeply used to reveal her psychology beyond vocation and ethic. The relationship with Marcus has a nice status shift via the leaves exposing his lie, but their bond remains schematic rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s dedication and core motive—preserving the “color of wonder”—are clear and consistent, and the occupational detail of tuning bells in a wordless world gives her specificity. However, her interiority remains mostly inferred from description; we rarely feel active, contradictory impulses or concrete emotional struggle in the moment. Her seasonal muteness is interesting but doesn’t generate a difficult choice or visible interpersonal cost on the page. The final sense of “she had succeeded” lands more as confirmation than as a hard‑won, ambivalent victory.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael-9’s motive set—protect the farm and resolve “inner static”—is clear and consistently drives every major choice, especially triggering the controlled burn and archiving the fears. Interiority is specific enough (fear of deletion, solitude, eternal function) to feel character-particular despite the abstract register. The android’s contradiction—nostalgia vs. the need to destroy the oldest roses—is dramatized, not just stated. A slight tendency to summarize emotion in conceptual terms keeps it just shy of truly piercing interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her choice to hang back while Mr. Alvarez opens the mailbox nicely aligns action with character. However, interiority leans on declarative thesis (“to prove that listening heals…”) and abstract trait-labeling (“the attribute of leads through following”) rather than fully dramatized, contradictory impulses. Mr. Alvarez is efficiently sketched, with his age and guilt embodied in specific movement and gesture, but he remains somewhat archetypal. The emotional change at the end feels earned but also a touch tidy, with little lingering ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—to liberate buried confessions and reframe vulnerability as strength—is clear and consistently enacted through her preparation and dance-decoding. Her competence is vivid, but we get limited contradiction or live internal friction; she rarely feels in danger, emotionally or physically. The spider/web motif hints at patience and obsession but doesn’t fully flower into a tension between doubt and drive. The closing realization about spinning “a bridge between drowning and breathing” is earned, but the personal cost of that choice remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (to locate lost memories, especially around her sister) is clear, persistent, and drives every choice, from abandoning her post to digging in the salt. Interiority is vivid and particular (“trembled from the recognition of approaching revelation”), but we see little real contradiction or ambivalence under pressure—she rarely wavers or faces a true internal cross-pressure. The final realization about migration vs. destruction of memory is earned but edges close to tidy epiphany. Overall, she feels specific and psychologically coherent, just short of fully complex.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The summoner’s motive—to contain the coded prophecy—is clear and consistent, and her actions align well with that goal. However, she reads more as a stable archetype than a fully individuated person; we get little in the way of specific flaws or contradictory impulses under pressure. The “tranquil blaze” is evocative but doesn’t generate concrete internal conflict or visible psychological cost. Her endurance at the end feels earned but emotionally under-detailed for top-tier literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation—to “learn the language of old buildings”—is vivid and consistently dramatized, and Elias’s spectral status is handled with pleasing restraint. Their dynamic around “agreed upon lies” gives the relationship a specific, slightly eerie intimacy. However, Maya’s internal conflict (fear of seeming mad vs. desire to listen) stays mostly conceptual; we don’t see her pushed into a difficult on-page choice where those impulses truly collide. The final transformation into part of the building’s “vocabulary” feels earned but could land even harder with one sharper moment of resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior conflict between armored skepticism and the pull of connection is clear, specific, and active throughout, and her final shift from compulsion to chosen burden feels earned. Details like her “ghostly resolve” and the way the memory’s images destabilize her beliefs make her feel particular rather than archetypal. The main limitation is that her realization at the end edges toward articulated thesis rather than being fully dramatized in competing impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—committing treason to retroactively create peace—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her actions and tools (“Each flourish of the Queen's hand had to suggest hesitation where there was certainty”). Her patience and guilt are well-grounded in the seven-year endurance and blood-ink ritual, giving her a distinctive psychological texture. Internal conflict is present but could sharpen further in real-time doubt or near-refusal at peak beats, which would heighten cost. The final weeping and “loosening of the chains” reads as an earned renunciation of her burden rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (her sister’s fate and the ethics of echoing) is clear and consistent, and her perceptiveness is embodied in concrete childhood details and present choices. The internal conflict between grief/anger and the lure of a larger-preservation purpose is present but under-dramatized; once the truth is revealed, her decision comes a bit too cleanly. The Archivists remain largely symbolic, exerting little individualized pressure on her choice. Still, the final stance—ensuring echo becomes choice, not capture—feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply drawn through vocation, method, and motive, and her professionalism as a wreck-diver/ghost-whisperer feels particular rather than generic. Her core want—to salvage a pure truth from corrupted narratives—is clear and consistent, and her withholding of the child’s survival from the captain shows value-driven micro-choice. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or struggles, so her final resolve to write feels like a continuation rather than a pressured, costly shift. The captain is effective as a single-note counterforce but not deeply characterized beyond his paternal love.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen is specific, textured, and motivated by a clear, character-particular philosophy of “hidden effort,” with her occupation and tools tightly fused to worldview. Her micro-choices (climbing the parapet, using the whisk as conduit, staying to finish the net) are coherent and revealing. Internal contradiction is muted; she mostly confirms rather than struggles with her beliefs, so the final realization reads as deepening rather than a pressured shift. The endurance-style closure (quiet satisfaction in unseen repair) feels earned but low in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply etched: competent, skeptical, driven by an almost professional hostility to myth, and her actions (reconstructing letters, building the resonator, choosing to leave) are tightly motivated. The settlers are more of a collective pressure than individuated characters, which fits the length but flattens relational nuance. Internal conflict—between preserving her sanctuary and her drive to debunk—is implied but not deeply dramatized moment-to-moment. The ending choice to walk back into the wasteland feels earned but carries more conceptual than viscerally felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation and worldview are vivid and specific—“variant allegiance,” “locksmith of realities,” and his engineered loneliness all cohere into a distinct psyche. His choices (listening, calculating, arranging aerials, whispering counter-words) clearly arise from that worldview. Internal contradiction is lighter; he is more monolithically devoted than torn, so we feel steady obsession more than conflict. The cost—perfected loneliness—lands, but could cut deeper emotionally for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt, tenderness, and obsessive archivist impulse are rendered with concrete, specific history (professor-turned-vagrant, jars of sounds, the abandoned daughter) that makes his final decision to leave feel fully earned. His internal contradiction—hoarder of the past vs would-be messenger to the future—is clear and active. The emotional beats when he discovers the music box and arranges the jars around it are embodied and particular, not generic. The only limit is that all relational pressure is off-page (the daughter never appears), so his conflict never has to answer direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives and traits (engineer, “logically emotional,” guardian of the key) are clear and consistently drive her choices, and her fear and determination are embodied in breath, lungs, pulse, and the feel of the key. The internal duality between logic and feeling is articulated, but mostly in summary rather than as live contradictory impulses tugging her in different directions in specific beats. Once she decides to head for the lighthouse, there’s little hesitation or genuine misstep; she’s highly competent in a way that leaves limited room for messy human error. The final stance—accepting the ongoing cost of her role—feels earned, but the emotional change is more stated than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and specific—her history as a “horizon mapper,” her disciplined patience, and her contained wildness all feel coherent with her choices in the scene. Motivation is clear and rooted in experience with the consortium and dead predecessors. Internal conflict (anger vs discipline) is present but mostly articulated in summary rather than dramatized through multiple micro-choices under pressure beyond the controlled crossing. The ending stance—wildness “stretched and settled”—is earned but could land harder with one on-page moment of near-failure or temptation to rush.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and particular: her guilt over ignoring Elias’s call, her ingrained methodology, and the shift from his “clinical shadow” to her own conscience all feel earned. Contradictory impulses—loyalty vs. resentment, empiricism vs. intuition—are present simultaneously in the tunnel. The final renunciation of his influence (continuing his rigor but not his conclusions) lands as a credible, costly change. If anything, a few psychological labels (“controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) lightly smooth over what is already dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt, professional role, and need for atonement are clear and drive his choices, culminating in a credible decision to pursue exoneration. His internal conflict (faith in the system vs. doubt and remorse) is present but could be rendered more through contradictory impulses in-scene rather than reflective exposition. The relationship with Marcus’s memory functions as a crucible, though the living repairman applies only mild pressure. The cost of his change—upending his own institutional complicity—is implied but could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kip reads as a distinct, odd, and appealing mind—patient, “steadily curious,” and irreverently awed by their task. Motivation is clear and coherent across centuries, and choices (continuing to transliterate, aligning the final cog) track with that drive. What’s missing for a higher tier is any sustained internal contradiction or real emotional cost beyond abstract satisfaction; Kip never wavers, fears, or doubts. The ending feels like fulfillment without a visible psychic price or renounced alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive (obsession with where deleted files go) is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in concrete, contradictory impulses. We see little embodied struggle or real cost as she pursues the truth; she mostly glides from realization to realization. Her professional competence is convincing, yet emotional specificity around the Hermes IX discovery feels underdeveloped for the stakes involved. The final “understanding” reads more like a conceptual conclusion than an earned, conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives and values are sharply drawn—her refusal of binary sacrifice and her peacekeeper training clearly drive every choice—while details like the sentient shadows keep her from feeling generic. Internal conflict between saving the nomads and preserving the orchard is present and specific, though her solution arrives with relatively little visible emotional fraying or doubt. Phrases like “mapping empathy onto action” verge on concept-label more than embodied struggle, slightly distancing us from her felt experience. Still, the final shift into being “the courageous anomaly” reads earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Her motivation—coming as a euthanasia tourist to “research” endings—is clear, specific, and deepens credibly into a more ambiguous relation to death by the end. The internal contradiction between detachment and the latent wish to live is present throughout and crystallizes around the child’s shoe and the appointment in her pocket. Emotional states are expressed mostly via filtered perception and image rather than labeled feelings, which keeps them character-particular. The final charged poise (appointment kept or not) feels earned by prior interior turns and carries a real, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena is sharply realized through vocation, sensibility, and a credible inner shift from abandonment to a charged acceptance. The way she reads the vineyard and the letter reveals a distinct, rooted-yet-contemplative character. The main weakness is that some of her thinking slides into abstract, essayistic diction that feels slightly more theoretical than embodied, which blunts the messiness of conflict in places.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line walker’s motivation—to consecrate and preserve the prophet’s echo—is clear and consistent, and her humility vs. responsibility gives her interiority some texture. However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched; she is competent, calm, and “strangely honest,” but we rarely see that honesty cost her or clash with fear or doubt. Her micro-choices (spiraling approach, listening first, removing the mask) are specific and aligned with her worldview. The ending offers an earned endurance stance, but the emotional price of handing wisdom to the earth remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is clear, coherent, and motivated, with the archivist vocation and her drive “to transmute pain into a masterpiece” grounding her choices. What’s missing, especially for top-tier work, is sharper internal contradiction or felt risk—she never seems in danger of being wrong about her method or of failing these people. Her realization that the masterpiece is the healing, not the archive, is a nice turn but reads more as confirmation than costly reorientation. The townsfolk are effectively sketched but remain largely emblematic rather than fully pressuring her.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve and decode the new living language—is clear, consistent, and refracted through specific habits (spore over syntax, holographic shards, her reverent handling of the crystal). Her reticence and “weathered innocence” feel particular rather than generic, and the final choice to testify via placement instead of speech is credibly rooted in those traits. The internal conflict between preservation and acceptance is present but remains relatively soft-edged, more implied than sharply dramatized in competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to capture the sound of aging before his precognitive forgetting erases it—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice (chalk, driftwood, returning to the center). His interiority is vivid and embodied (“tidal longing pulled at his ribs”), with a credible contradiction between methodical preparation and inevitable failure. The main limitation is scope: we never see a non-mystical facet of him (no concrete history or relationship), so he reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully individuated person. For this length it still works, but a single sharper, idiosyncratic detail of life beyond the garden would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s vocation, stubbornness in refusing evacuation, and lifelong hunger to “harness the ephemeral” make her feel particular and coherent, and her micro-choices (climbing toward danger, choosing the leaf recording) track cleanly with those motives. However, her interiority leans serene and assured even under catastrophic pressure, with only glancing contradiction or messiness, so we miss a sharper sense of simultaneous fear/attachment that could deepen cost. The transformation into a “changelessly constant element” is earned conceptually but feels more thematic than psychologically contested. Strong, but not as emotionally knotted or conflicted as top-tier character work.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena, Maya, and Mr. Hale all read as specific, embodied people, with Elena’s professional composure, Maya’s weaponized nostalgia, and Hale’s brief lucidity all credibly motivated. The shift in Maya’s relationship to the vinyl shard—from weapon to conduit—is a clean, earned emotional turn. Interiority is mostly inferred through action and image rather than directly accessed, which works but keeps us at a slight remove. The final endurance—Maya leaving with both hope and weight—is believable and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation (finding where shadows go at noon and freeing the sealed awakenings) is clear and consistently drives her actions, and her competence as a rune scholar is well-grounded in specific practices. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or internal contradiction, and her emotional life remains somewhat abstracted compared to the conceptual worldbuilding. The final stance—accepting a long, difficult task as custodian—is earned but reads more as smooth continuation than as a choice with sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s “forgiving skeptic” identity and her drive to mend rather than destroy are clear and consistent, embodied in choices like splinting the changeling’s arm and seeking the real girl. Interiority is specific (effigy under floorboards, tooth in pocket), and her shift from rigid rationalism to a stitched-together understanding feels earned. The relationship with the changeling has nuance—she’s wary but compassionate. A slight weakness is the occasional thesis-like line (“her motivation to turn mistakes into constellations”) that flattens some of the complexity into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation (atoning for destructive fire by learning to refract borrowed light) is clear, consistent, and organically escalates into the final act of arranging the glass. Her interiority is concrete and particular—ritual gestures, breath in sync with circular motions, and the bodily memory of falling. The change at the end (from hunger for flame to quiet, prism-like acceptance) is earned by prior obsession and patience, with the years of exile as visible cost. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in real time, but the arc still lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmute a publicly weaponized confession into a private, organic healing process—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted in her small choices (tending moss, relinquishing the pendant). Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, and the tension between exposure and retreat underlies nearly every paragraph. The final renunciation (leaving the pendant) feels earned by the prior build-up of her guardedness and attachment. The main limitation is that her internal conflict, while present, could be pushed into sharper contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s conflicting impulses—quitting vs transforming her vocation—are clear and consistent, and her choices (coming to the nexus, performing the ceremony, deciding to remain) align with that motive. Interiority is strong but skews conceptual; we get more about “shapes of different hopes” than about how her body reacts or how fear/relief coexist under pressure. The final renunciation of her old life carries some cost conceptually but is under-embodied, almost serene. This keeps the arc convincing but short of fully felt, high-stakes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore the sacred harvest practices—is clear, specific, and grounded in her history with the archives, and her tinkerer identity coheres with the chronometer and her methodical preparation. Interiority is present but leans more toward worldbuilding and ritual logic than emotionally contradictory impulses; we don’t feel much fear that this might fail or a deep personal cost if it does. Her whimsical/priestess duality is strong and particular, especially in the final recognition that her “truest expression” is in restoring reciprocity, not gadgets. The ending gives her a meaningful shift in self-understanding, but the lack of visible doubt or internal friction undercuts how hard-won that feels.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid, specific, and coherently tied to every on-page action, and the piece succeeds at making “translating heartbeats into maps” feel like a credible obsession rather than a label. Her patience versus her usual explosive craft gives her some internal tension, and the choice to bind her own heartbeat to the light of a dead sun reads as an earned, costly commitment. However, we rarely see true contradictory impulses or live alternatives beyond devotion versus implied exile; the interiority is textured but not deeply conflicted. The final renunciation of other paths (any life outside this ritual) is powerful but more conceptual than emotionally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated by a deeply ingrained craftsman’s mindset and a quiet devotion to preserving the cavern’s wonder, with his locksmith background concretely shaping his actions. Interiority is particular (peripheral vision, mapping light angles) rather than generic, and his competence reads earned. What’s missing at this tier is a stronger sense of internal contradiction or emotional cost—he never seriously doubts, frays, or pays a personal price beyond effort. The final smile feels appropriate but relatively undemanding emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and role as mediator of sorrow are vivid and consistent, and her choices (lighting the lamp, orienting the loom, calcifying sorrows, stopping at dawn) all track cleanly with that drive. However, her inner conflict is more implied than dramatized; we rarely see contradictory impulses truly pressure a choice in scene, which keeps the emotional arc somewhat static. The “boundary-lessly trapped” condition is intriguing but remains largely conceptual rather than pushing her into a difficult renunciation on the page. The final endurance—continuing to count sorrows in the dark—reads as Earned Stasis but with limited on-page cost beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s inner life is specific, embodied, and consistent, with grief expressed through tactile choices (carving the handle, making tea) rather than labels. Her motivation—to turn loss into something usable—is clear and enacted in micro-choices throughout. There is a quiet but credible shift from raw absence to “rust-hued peace,” an earned stasis rather than a neat cure. Internal contradiction (holding on vs. letting go) is present but could surface more sharply under pressure to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motive—to finally confront and trade with her own younger ghost—is clear, specific, and carries through the whole piece. Her mix of professional scavenger resolve and deep-seated temporal/regret confusion gives her interiority nuance beyond stock melancholy. The final renunciation (offering her own regret instead of others’ stories) feels earned by prior setup about her collection and long delay. The ghost as younger self is simple but effective as a crucible, though a slightly sharper on-page clash between them could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s competence, curiosity, and “functionally creative” mindset are vividly established, and her actions track cleanly from those traits. Motivation is clear—she wants to resurrect the terminal and find “equations for hope”—and her engineering choices reveal character. What’s missing at this level is more visible internal contradiction or ambivalence; she never seriously doubts, misjudges, or pays a personal price beyond fatigue. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost, so the arc reads more confident than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to ritually relinquish her abandoned identity as a pianist—is clear, continuous, and filtered through specific, character-particular perception (“fingers trained to wind delicate mainsprings”). Her conflict between security and forsaken ambition is embodied rather than labeled, especially in the metronome beats and the sensory memory of her mother’s conservatory. The final renunciation (leaving the metronome) feels earned and costly, though the realization about what it means to “bear a dream” edges slightly toward tidy articulation. Overall, interiority is rich and specific, with only minor hints of over-shaped insight.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation—shifting from treasure-hunting to dissecting her mentor’s deceptions—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her interiority feels character-particular (“cumulative deviation,” “architecture of lies”) rather than generic. The final renunciation—stopping the legend chase to write her own—reads as earned by prior realizations. Emotional embodiment could go a shade deeper beyond the primarily intellectual register of her reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is specific and memorable—a “philosophical seed collector” of techniques with a clear, consistent drive—but he’s rendered more as a devoted function than a conflicted person. His patience, reverence, and vocation align cleanly with every action, which makes him coherent but low in internal contradiction. Emotional experience is mostly implied through setting and diction rather than sharply embodied or conflicted on the page. The fisherman functions as a quiet witness rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s vocation and method (“obituaries for the living,” projecting presence) give him a distinct, coherent psychology, and his emotional state is rendered through concrete, character-specific perceptions. His motivation—to understand and map healing—is clear and threads through his choices to write, to conjure Malvine, and finally to leave. The internal shift from clinging to presence to accepting himself as “cartographer of their own vacant spaces” reads earned. There could be a touch more lived contradiction or messiness under peak pressure, but what’s here is strong and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s core drive—to resurrect beauty in a world of metal—is vivid and sustained, with strong interior specificity (“gravity’s memory, the chemical structure of hope”). His emotional state feels embodied (shaking hands, tears hissing on coils) rather than abstract. Internal contradiction (exultation vs dread at bringing a bird into an unfit world) is present but could be deepened into sharper, on-page conflict. The arc from obsession to humbled awe at the hatchling is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and specific: arsonist’s daughter, firefighter, burn survivor, and self-healer in one body, with the choice of “truck over her bloodline” anchoring her moral spine. Her motivation to rewire her relationship with fire and her scars is coherent throughout and lands cleanly in the final image of “scars finally singing.” The tension between inherited “genetic compulsion” and self-chosen vocation gives her more than one axis of conflict. The only minor limitation is that internal contradiction is more narrated than dramatized in live moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and tied to specific choices (following the mica trail, waiting through the night, pressing the star on the box). The “luminous skeptic” concept gives her a distinct stance toward the city’s lies, and that stance visibly drives action. However, internal contradiction and felt emotional cost are underdeveloped; she rarely struggles or doubts in the moment, so her success feels somewhat frictionless. The final satisfaction is earned but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (“to share light without using fire”) is clear, consistent, and plausibly escalates into her final act of self-dissolution, and her perception of the gear shifts credibly from key to lantern. However, her interior conflict is mostly conceptual rather than felt as contradictory impulses in the moment; she rarely seems genuinely tempted by the fire-starters’ path. The sentimentalist aspect is more told than dramatized in distinctive emotional contradictions. The closing change reads earned but relatively serene, with limited visible cost beyond the implied sacrifice of individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as a contemplative craftsman whose vocation and grief research align convincingly, and the grandmother’s presence gives him a lived relational axis rather than leaving him as a pure solo meditator. His motivations—to understand collective grief, to honor the family’s poetic custom—are clear and consistent. What's missing at this tier is more palpable internal contradiction or risk (he rarely feels genuinely torn between options), so his final understanding feels more like a maturation of a stance than a hard-won reversal. The characterization is strong but could bear more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply etched as meticulous, guilt-ridden, and ethically diligent, with the rake handle as a strong, character-specific totem. His long-term motivation for atonement is clear and plausibly scaled to forty years. What’s thinner is active contradiction in the present moment—he never wavers or risks choosing expedience, so the internal conflict feels largely resolved before the scene starts. The endurance/renunciation at the end (leaving the handle) is earned but not sharply painful on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s curiosity, ritual habits, and inherited precision are clear and consistent, and her decoding work nicely reveals character through action. What’s missing at this level is genuine internal contradiction or visible emotional cost—she never wavers or struggles in a way that complicates her desire to know. The final “understanding” feels coherent but a bit frictionless, more realization than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and consistent, with a clear value hierarchy—constraint, stewardship, and cautious innovation—but her emotional life stays largely in one contemplative register. The core motive (encode regenerative futures within rigid limits) is well grounded in her temperament and history of mapping the unknown. However, we don’t see much genuine internal contradiction or struggle on the page; she never seriously wavers or risks a wrong choice. The final “change” (from anticipation to completion) feels more like fulfillment of a given nature than a costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to end the story famine by embedding narrative in music and dust—is clear, specific, and coherently pursued. His interiority is more archetypal than psychologically granular, but it fits the fable-like mode and avoids generic labels. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sustained contradiction under pressure: we rarely see him torn between incompatible impulses in-scene. The endurance at the end (remaining in the alcove, still working) reads as an earned stasis, but the personal cost stays largely implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—turning his mother and his grief into art—is specific, consistent, and plausibly obsessive, and his guilt over leaving her interweaves cleanly with his professional compulsion. Internal contradiction (preserve vs destroy, safety vs exposure) is dramatized through choices like burning the portrait, wearing the painful mask, and finally removing it. Emotions are embodied in tactile details (porcelain cutting skin, charcoal on fingers) rather than labels. The only limit is that all other relationships remain off-page, so the crucible is somewhat hermetic.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is sharply realized: the “wannabe philosopher” sneered at by others, aware of his own myth-making, yet compelled by a rationalist ethic. His internal conflict (ego-serving preservation vs resistance to power-serving superstition) is active on the page and drives the central choice. Embodied touches like the rust-tasting water, stiff sleeves, and trembling chest keep him from being purely cerebral. The final decision to keep the cog and teach in secret feels fully motivated and carries credible cost in isolation and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s long history, vocation, and quiet desperation are sharply etched, and the three students each carry distinct, legible burdens (inherited hatred, complicity in burning halls, class background). Motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to preserve a vanishing reconciliatory art by testing it on a fraught trio. However, much of the internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices, especially for the students. The miner’s daughter’s fear and prejudice, for instance, are told more than embodied beyond the single gesture of omitting sharp notes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s core motivation (relief from inherited trauma + desire to restore erased knowledge) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to risk the banquet feels earned. The tasting of specific memories (soldier, mother, chairman) nicely individualizes her burden. Internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in real-time beats, which mutes some potential volatility. Her “informally wise” quality leans a bit label-y, with less on-page contradiction or blind spots than would fully flesh her out at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and memorable—the involuntary truthfulness, the heirloom box, and his drive to preserve wonder all cohere into a distinct character whose choices shape the scene. His motivation to protect the bees’ “beauty” is clear and consistent, and the engineer’s presence gives him a live relational crucible. However, internal conflict is muted: his compulsion removes most ambiguity around whether he’ll speak, so we don’t see him truly torn between risk and truth. The final beat reads more as serene acceptance than a costly, pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s characterization as a “creeping normality noticer” is vivid and particular, and her method of reading displaced objects feels intrinsic to who she is. Her motive—to understand why some houses feel alive—is clear and consistent, and her choices flow logically from that desire. The main limitation is the relative lack of internal contradiction or felt cost; she moves from curiosity to insight with little emotional friction. The piece hints that her attention has consequences but doesn’t fully explore her ambivalence or responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corvin’s interiority is rich, specific, and morally conflicted—his shift from wanting restoration to wanting “nuance” feels organically earned from the revelation about the caretakers. The statue body and telepathy are well-integrated into how he perceives and acts. The main limit is how often his motives are stated in thematic language rather than shown through messier, less self-aware feeling; the internal struggle edges toward thesis articulation in places. Still, his final choice to use the fissure and ampoule reads as a credible, costly acceptance of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—her refusal to descend and her obsession with the “texture of a missed opportunity”—is specific, coherent, and deeply tied to her behavior. The internal conflict between grim optimism and exhaustion, and between forward motion and the knowledge that the exit lay behind her, plays credibly on the page. Her final act (choosing a conceptual escape rather than more climbing) feels earned by her earlier stubbornness and mathematical turn of mind. The only thing holding this just short of top-tier is that we never see her values tested against any relationship or external pressure; it’s a beautifully rendered solo crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and particular—using her insomnia and the brush to prove that forgotten kindness persists—and her sensory interiority feels embodied rather than generic. The trait “methodically hopeful” is nicely dramatized in the way she works and arranges the glyphs. However, she experiences relatively little on-page contradiction or internal conflict; exhaustion never seriously undercuts her resolve or decisions. The ending stance (setting the brush down for this lunar phase) feels more like completion than a pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara is clearly motivated by preservation and a dawning recognition that silence is itself destructive, and her key choice—to confront the elders and catalyze testimony—feels earned by her earlier cataloging and the bread epiphany. Interiority is filtered through concrete work (cataloging, examining mold, arranging loaves), which grounds her. Internal contradiction (reverence for tradition vs. earlier dismissal of the bread custom) appears but could be pushed harder under peak pressure. The elders remain mostly a collective presence rather than individuated pressures, which slightly flattens relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—escaping a scripted death—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her competence as a tinkerer feels grounded in specific behaviors (“neatly inventive precision”). What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or moral friction as she enacts what is essentially a cosmic transgression. Her emotions are mostly described in elevated abstractions (“bleak exhilaration of transgression”) rather than embodied, stress-degraded reactions. The final choice to step into the beam is thematically coherent but emotionally a bit too frictionless for full-on elite characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her morbid artistry, engineered drowning, and childhood complicity in her mother’s death combine into a genuinely dark, non-safety-hedged psyche. Her final confession feels earned by prior guilt and dream-dictionary study, and it plausibly reorients her relationship to fear. The main weakness is that a couple of major beats (“orchestrated her own drowning,” insurance motive) arrive as compressed declarations rather than dramatized contradictions under pressure. Still, her motives, flaws, and change are coherent and compelling at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prophet’s primary motivation—turning obstacles into instruments—is clear and consistent, and her occupational detail (cloud-reading, cataloguing pitches of trees) individualizes her. However, she functions more as an archetypal figure than a psychologically complex person; we get little contradictory impulse or embodied emotional ambiguity under pressure. Her reactions to danger remain serenely competent, so we never see genuine fear, doubt, or selfishness complicate her drive. The ending registers endurance more than an earned internal shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to decode the turtles’ memories and the watchers’ purpose, driven by the loss of the expedition—is clear and consistently rooted in her “quietly driven” temperament. Her profession (spiral-shell cartographer) meaningfully shapes how she thinks and acts, especially in the climax. Internal conflict is subtle but present in the final question of mapping versus becoming part of the pattern. I’d like one or two more embodied flashes of fear or doubt under pressure to fully dimensionalize her beyond her intellectual focus.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motives are clear, coherent, and specific to her profession; her need to honor both truth and Ashford’s conflicted love gives her a credible, mature interiority. The moment where she chooses how to answer her editor text is a clean crystallization of her values. However, her emotional struggle feels slightly under-pressured; the choice reads more as an elegant alignment of principles than a wrenching conflict with visible cost. A touch less abstraction and a bit more embodied hesitation would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s professional rigor, quiet obsession, and emotional restraint are rendered with specificity, especially in the tension between “professional neutrality” and the “hushed blaze” in her eyes. Her motivation (to archive abandoned dreams) is clear and consistent with her choices, and the physical details (trembling hands, straining at the door) ground her. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle; we don’t see her desires truly pull against one another in a way that forces a hard choice. The ending endurance—her commitment to return—is credible Earned Stasis, though the personal cost is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (from mechanical indexing to “tracing honest origins”) is clear and consistent, and the final renunciation—overhauling three years of work—is credibly earned. His professional lens shapes perception in a specific way, but emotional life is largely abstracted into phrases like “dappled resolve” and “reclaimed stillness,” with little embodied contradiction or stress response. Internal conflict (comfort in order vs. obligation to complexity) is implied more than dramatized in on-page hesitation or difficult micro-choices. The result is a well-drawn but somewhat too serene intellect under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s grief, vocation, and dawning understanding of her true purpose are clear and consistent, and her final choice to release the cranes and disperse is well-motivated by what’s come before. The interiority is vivid and embodied through tools and ritual rather than labels, and the paradox of clinging vs. letting go is present throughout. However, her personality beyond the role of grieving artisan is only lightly sketched, and we get limited contradiction or concrete, character-specific memories of her lost family to deepen her particularity. The apprentice at the end functions more as a thematic echo than a relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amara’s motivation—grief sublimated into a mathematically precise hunt for lost futures—is vivid and specific, and her choices track cleanly from that core. The fusion of technical competence and emotional damage feels credible. Internal contradiction (vengeance vs contact/confirmation) is implied but not fully dramatized on the page. The closing decision to descend with the geode reads emotionally earned, though the complexity of her ambivalence could be pushed further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive chain (grandmother’s life work → chip → observatory → longing for “home”) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (tracking the pilgrim, aligning the mechanism, pulling the lever, inserting the chip) align with that drive. His interiority is specific enough to feel individual (retinal display, drone pilot past, typographic obsession) but remains mostly reverent awe rather than conflicted. We don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine risk of renunciation; he’s never truly tempted not to proceed. The final shift toward felt belonging is earned but comes without a strong sense of cost or internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply etched: his profession, guilt, and almost scientific need to “measure the mass” of what he’s done all cohere into a specific, flawed person. The internal contradiction—professional detachment versus personal culpability—plays out credibly in his meticulous search and his refusal to indulge in “redemption” fantasies. His final decision to find the daughter reads as an earned, costly stance rather than a neat absolution. A slight limitation is that all other relationships are off-stage, so his emotional range is mostly confined to a single (powerful) register.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator is clearly motivated—“recycling mistakes into wisdom” is dramatized via her timing, object choice, and ritual care—yet she remains almost entirely controlled, with limited on-page contradiction or emotional fraying under pressure. Her actions (timing with the moon, using the drawer pull as signal and gift, insisting on “restoration, not retribution”) track well with her role. Secondary characters are sketched but functional, pressing the scene without stealing focus. The endurance at the end (remaining on the parapet, preparing for the next phase) reads as an earned stasis, though the personal cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias reads as a specific, internally conflicted person—competent yet broken, self-punishing yet oddly buoyant—and his actions (clutching the compass, choosing poles over stars, beached arrival) consistently arise from that knot. The “merrily melancholic” dissonance is embodied in details like humming a shanty while reliving the accident, not just labeled. His final choice to set the compass down and accept a grounded self feels earned by the accumulated backstory and present-tense behavior. The only limitation is that the piece edges toward thematic explanation at times rather than letting contradiction surface entirely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s core drive—to regain empathy before she calcifies into something worse than her former killer self—is clear, specific, and consistently motivating. Her interiority has concrete, character-particular touches (e.g., reflexive decoding skills, the ghost-twitch of her trigger finger) that keep her from reading as an abstraction. The final shift into tearful recognition of her victims feels earned by the accumulated failures and guilt in the labyrinth, though the emotionally transformative beat happens relatively fast on the page. Phrases like “jaded wanderer seeking wonder” edge toward thematic shorthand rather than fully embodied conflict, slightly softening the rigor of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim her sister at the cost of her own human form—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. The internal conflict between “I don’t want to lose myself” and her willingness to proceed is credible and embodied in sensory detail. The beast-whisperer background neatly foreshadows her becoming “the translation itself,” though Mara’s characterization is thinner and primarily thematic. The final acceptance of expansion rather than loss feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a clear tension between her desire to reclaim lost time and her guilt/resentment about motherhood. Her cartomancer competence is balanced by the vulnerability of her cards going blank, and her decisions in the glade (bleeding into the saucer, tracing her daughter’s hands, unfastening the clasp) all flow from that mix of devotion and uncertainty. The earned stasis at the end—choosing sanctification over reclamation—feels motivated by the prior beats and carries a visible cost. The only modest limitation is that no other character is on stage to further sharpen her contradictions relationally.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s pacifism, guilt, and long-term shadow work give him a clear, specific psychology, and his final choice to pierce the barrier with a “compassion-imbued crystal” feels thematically earned. However, much of his inner struggle is summarized as completed work (“Elias had spent decades in meditation… integrating his shadow”) rather than dramatized in present-tense contradiction, which mutes the felt difficulty of his final act. Emotional states tend toward abstract language (“integration,” “complicity,” “capacity for harm”) rather than embodied conflict under pressure. The closing transformation into “weightless with compassion” is strong but would land harder if we’d seen more concrete failure or temptation along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is specific and memorable, with a clear life arc from industrial wealth to anonymous, emptied-out benefactor, and his final surrender to the ash feels motivated by his long-term drive to serve unseen. His philanthropy, poverty, and role as “Catalyst of Ash” cohere, but his emotional life is rendered more in ideas than in embodied contradiction—there’s little felt friction between fear of death and desire for understanding. The micro-choices (placing jars, opening them one by one, lying down) do reveal his value hierarchy, yet they unfold with near-total serenity, which slightly flattens internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s competence, patience, and role as “vigilant lock sentinel” are clear and consistent, and her actions align tightly with her revolutionary motive. However, she reads as almost frictionlessly capable, with little internal contradiction or emotional jeopardy—no moment where fear, doubt, or conflicting loyalties complicate her choices. The result is a vivid but somewhat flat psychological profile. The final stance (mission complete, seeds planted) feels earned but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The eel herder’s core motivation (the promise, the curse, the drive to understand patterns) is clear and consistent, and his final choice to step into the field is well motivated. However, internal contradiction is mostly implied (“future he both feared and needed”) rather than dramatized through in-the-moment struggle. We rarely see his emotions embodied under pressure; the piece favors conceptual description over felt, conflicting impulses. Strong mythic presence, but a bit cool and abstract for top-tier interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to reclaim her censored voice and decode her father’s legacy) is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in objects and choices (the climb, the silence, the decision to write and rehide the pages). Her interiority is rich and particular—“furiously tranquil resolve of the damned” is a defining contradiction that feels earned. The generational echo via her father’s hands and shared scars creates a credible inner arc from silence to testimony. The one limit is that the piece leans more on articulated insight than dramatized internal conflict at the peak, softening the sense of real risk or ambivalence in her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aldric and Silas are sketched with clear, particular traits (mechanical arm from a “philosophical disagreement,” “diplomatically fierce” composure), and their relationship believably shifts from rivalry to alliance. Motivation—to turn philosophical questions into literal destinations—is explicit and aligned with their choices. However, interior conflict is relatively thin; we don’t feel much contradictory emotion in Aldric during the duel or the choice to share the discovery. The truce lands, but with minimal sensed cost or psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s molting condition, his current “penny poet” self, and his anxiety about forgetting his purpose create a distinct, textured protagonist, and Marcus’s steadiness gives their relationship weight. Motivation is clear (serve the resistance, preserve books, plant the garden) and tied to specific choices, especially the handoff of the tin before the molt. However, interior conflict is more stated than dramatized—his fear of transformation doesn’t meaningfully distort his behavior in-scene beyond one confession. Emotional embodiment leans abstract (“current self…straining”) rather than grounded in sensory or bodily detail under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s motivation—grief for Maya transmuted into the drive to find refuge—is clear and tightly tied to her technical ingenuity, and her micro-choices (modifying the piano, choosing to interpret the film, playing through the storm) all align. The tension between her acceptance of a “final performance” and her decision to “surprise fate with an unplanned encore” gives her a credible internal conflict. Emotional texture, though often effective, leans on a few abstract phrases (“steely longing,” “strategically creative with grief”) rather than more embodied, idiosyncratic sensations, which slightly blunts peak moments. Still, her arc toward a tempered peace at the end feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s role, goal, and competence are crisply defined, and her “reality checker” mindset gives her a distinct interior filter. Motivation is strong and specific (recent losses, entrusted seeds), and her actions track cleanly with that drive. However, internal contradiction is only lightly dramatized: her fear of corrupting the memory surfaces but is never really forced into a difficult trade-off. The ending’s luminous doubt is compelling but feels more conceptual than earned through on-page missteps or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s inner life is textured, specific, and embodied through tactile work with bonsai, the lace, and the compass, and her avoidance/engagement choices feel well-motivated. The evolution from control toward release in her pruning practice tracks cleanly with her grief arc. The Elias relationship is off-page yet reads as complex and costly through selective memories. The slight weakness is a relative smoothness of inner conflict—her contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized under acute pressure.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character interiority is distinct, contrasting cosmic scale with intimate decay effectively. The protagonist's shift in worldview is coherent, though the final transition to summary ("Weeks passed") slightly distances the reader from the immediate emotional cost of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is vivid, successfully grounding her trauma and artistic identity. However, the transition from suicidal despair to healed epiphany feels unearned within the scene's short scope; the resolution relies on a convenient external discovery (the journals) rather than an internal struggle or active choice that tests her "adaptive" nature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mara’s interiority relies heavily on "diagnostic label-speak" (e.g., "colors of envy," "crimson for grief") rather than embodied emotion. While the motivation to heal is clear, her actions in the scene are procedural—selecting forks without hesitation or difficult trade-offs—making the emotional journey feel performed for the concept rather than lived under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marian is a compelling focalizer whose professional worldview ("dignity of soil-bound death") authentically colors her perception of the surreal. Her motivation is singular and drives the narrative to a decisive renunciation of her former life, though the trait "inadvertently stubborn" relies on expository telling rather than dramatized friction to justify the delay and the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya is a competent, noble protagonist, but she lacks internal friction; her transition from committed secrecy to public exposure feels unearned by the brief interaction with the girl. She reads more as a thematic vessel than a character making difficult trade-offs under pressure, as the cost of losing anonymity is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maya functions as a vessel for the ritual rather than a character with contradictory impulses or genuine agency; her "choice" to heal is pre-ordained by her arrival. The past-life reveal serves as an explanation for the setting rather than a source of present-tense internal friction. The characterization relies on labels like "spiritually curious" rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias functions primarily as a camera for the setting rather than a character with conflicting desires; his abstract motivation to "map" time lacks emotional grounding. The final surrender feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice, as there is no active struggle against the garden's pull to give the sacrifice weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her stoicism fits the archetype, but the antagonist acts as a prop for her dignity rather than a genuine threat. The scavenger’s sudden psychological pivot—retreating solely because of her "staggering grace"—feels unearned and lacks psychological realism in a desperate setting.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a compelling, specific protagonist with a professional lens (acoustics) that shapes her worldview authentically. The internal conflict is clear, though the specific motivation—the betrayal of the child—arrives somewhat late in the narrative arc rather than pressurizing the opening beats, which renders the emotional climax slightly more summarized than embodied. The physical deterioration serves as a ticking clock but feels parallel to her choices rather than forcing a direct trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's "quietly savvy" nature is asserted via a convenient skill set (flower reading) rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or adaptation under pressure. While the internal longing at the closure adds depth, she navigates the central conflict with a perfect competence that precludes genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's specific expertise and coping mechanism (theatrical narration) create a distinct presence. However, the explicit labeling of her trait ("thoughtfully spirited") in the narration weakens the show-don't-tell discipline, and her internal arc lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory struggle; she executes a plan rather than wrestling with a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—reframing phobia as hyper-awareness—is compelling, but the backstory of being a "replacement" is delivered largely through summary exposition. The emotional realization of the phobia's value feels slightly lectured ("never understanding that the phobias were not weaknesses") rather than solely dramatized through the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    The oracle functions as a cohesive vessel for the concept, but her "mild obsession" is stated rather than dramatized through struggle. She lacks internal contradiction; her path is a straight line of ritual execution without emotional doubt or interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.7)
    Seven's interiority relies heavily on analytical summary ("Seven understood," "It knew now") rather than embodied struggle or contradictory impulses. The motivation shifts cleanly from duty to philosophical inquiry without sufficient friction or dilemma. The repeated attribute "remarkably composed" acts as a label rather than a trait tested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s internal conflict—weighing the discovery of the tickets against her own complicity in the missing records—provides strong, specific characterization. Her motivation to thaw mistrust is grounded in a concrete past action (the lie), elevating her beyond a generic observer.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is largely delivered through exposition ("Elara had learned...") rather than dramatized via a high-pressure choice; the character acts as a competent functionary without visible internal contradiction or immediate personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael is a competent focalizer with a clear goal, but his journey lacks internal conflict or genuine risk. He faces no significant opposition—Dr. Vex is a background skeptic rather than an active obstacle—and his success requires no sacrifice or difficult choice on the page. The "obliging" trait explains his presence but doesn't complicate the climax; he succeeds simply because he is right.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a passive conduit rather than an active protagonist; her motivation is vague ("inspired by dreams") and she acts on "certainty" rather than making difficult choices under pressure. She faces no internal conflict or doubts, resulting in a lack of character agency or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal landscape is compelling, filtering climate grief through the specific lens of her "fault-tolerant" trade. The transition from feverish uncertainty to cold, culpable realization is earned by the interior causality, though the "oracle" persona occasionally risks distancing the reader from her raw physical state.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s internal landscape is compelling, balancing skepticism with the desperate need to find meaning in the radio static. The shift from "reckless explorer" to a witness bearing the weight of specific tragedy is a subtle, earned character arc. Her refusal to accept the supernatural while seeking its data points adds excellent nuance to her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist functions as a passive camera rather than a character with agency or internal conflict; she observes without struggle. Emotional experience is summarized through abstract labels ("peace," "silence") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. No meaningful choice or cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on label-heavy interiority ("softly adaptive grace," "respecting boundaries") rather than messy, embodied contradictions. The protagonist’s motivation is stated explicitly ("to nurture lifelong wonder") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or potential failure. Emotional progression feels idealized and linear, lacking the friction of genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as an archetype—the lonely archivist—rather than a living character with internal contradictions or flaws. Her "hunger" for stories is stated, but her success is immediate and unopposed, lacking the struggle or "blind spots" that generate empathy. The "biological necessity" of her perception feels like a convenient superpower rather than an earned trait.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist's agency is fundamentally contradictory; he manually inserts "spycraft" microdots and coordinates yet is characterized as completely oblivious to their nature, creating an insurmountable logic flaw. Motivation is handled through abstract labels ("transpose life into a new key") rather than embodied desire, and the character remains a passive vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian is a hyper-competent technician who faces no internal contradiction or doubt. He performs the ritual efficiently, but without a dramatized personal cost or emotional struggle, the characterization feels flat and functional rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's specific backstory ("orange chicken and despair") provides a strong, cynical counterweight to the high-concept premise, but his interiority often relies on abstract diagnostic labels ("chronological homesickness," "temporal vertigo") rather than embodied emotion. The character experiences an epiphany without a dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse, making the realization feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a living character with embodied agency. Motivation is stated ("conquer the labyrinth") rather than felt through specific, grounded desires, and the internal conflict is summarized in high-concept terms ("regret and forgotten dreams") without concrete memories to give it weight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal struggle with grief is clear and central, driving the narrative arc effectively. However, the emotional progression relies heavily on stock metaphors ("shattered heart," "protective ice") and rapid healing, which simplifies the complexity of her trauma into a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exemplary; Elara's occupational lens filters every observation ("barometric shifts in human behavior"), creating a distinct and consistent interiority. Her decision to accept the "dual ledger" is a natural escalation of her established drive for accuracy, earning the shift from passive evasion to active resistance. The conflict between her desire for safety and her need for truth is dramatized through physical tremors and deliberate actions.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist's motivation and emotional arc are summarized through diagnostic interiority ("unprocessed grief," "matured into understanding") rather than dramatized through struggle. Elias is largely passive, receiving the climax as a pre-calculated gift from his late wife rather than earning it through a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is dense and consistent, but the "ethically playful" trait feels asserted by the narrator rather than organically dramatized in a crisis. The character functions more as a vessel for the story's philosophical thesis than as a living entity making painful choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara is a vehicle for the concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses; her competence is absolute, and she faces no internal struggle. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("Her motivation remained constant: to...") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or potential failure. There is no felt emotional cost to her actions; she sets out to perform a ritual and succeeds without hesitation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael is distinct but static; his "secret ambition" is resolved by environmental magic rather than a difficult, character-defining choice. The repetition of the trait "professionally thorough" feels like a label rather than embodied behavior, and his maintained "affectionate detachment" keeps the emotional stakes curiously low.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive") rather than demonstrated behavior. The protagonist's transformation from ruthless merchant to benevolent patron is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized through pressure-filled choices in the present. There is no visible internal struggle; his "warring" instincts resolve instantly without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character motivation is declared via summary ("desperate to graft oneself") rather than dramatized through resistance or specific interaction. The attribute "boldly sympathetic" appears as a direct label ("Kael, boldly sympathetic by nature") rather than emerging from a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara is a highly competent protagonist whose professional obsession drives the plot. Her internal conflict—the "terrible gift" of time theft versus the burden of documentation—adds weight to her actions. The "trembling fingers" beat effectively grounds her high-concept ability in physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elian acts as a passive observer who succeeds without struggle, rendering his internal victory unearned. His motivation is abstract ("quantify the weight of longing"), and he faces no difficult choices or behavioral trade-offs. The character feels like a vessel for thematic keywords rather than a distinct agent navigating a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya is consistently drawn as "kindly methodical," and her actions align with this trait. However, the lack of significant internal conflict or a high-pressure micro-choice limits the characterization; she executes a routine without facing a dilemma that tests her resolve or forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s internal conflict between control and chaos is clearly defined, though her epiphany feels somewhat rushed for the scope. The transition from rigid scientist to surrendering servant relies heavily on intellectual reflection rather than dramatic pressure or difficult on-page choices. Her motivation is consistent, but the psychological shift is told through exposition more than shown through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s internal arc from insomnia-as-curse to insomnia-as-vigil is compelling and resolves with a clear shift in perspective. However, the specific descriptor "wryly earnest" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated, and the motivation to "thresh meaning" feels slightly abstract until the physical exchange grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara functions more as a witness than an active agent; her primary action is an internal acceptance of external events rather than a high-stakes choice. While her shift from pride to humility is legible, the realization is delivered via narrative summary ("Elara realized then," "Elara understood") rather than dramatized struggle. The pilgrim serves as a catalyst/prop rather than a fully realized counter-weight in a relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is a competent protagonist whose motivation drives the narrative, though his "reactively visionary" nature functions more as a plot device than a source of deep internal conflict. His interaction with the widow provides a necessary human anchor, yet his internal struggle remains somewhat abstract and resolved through external observation rather than costly personal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motivation regarding her sister is clear and drives the narrative, but her interiority relies heavily on repetitive diagnostic labels ("analytically artistic," "trembling certainty") rather than distinct, embodied personality. While the grief is palpable, the characterization feels constrained by these recurring tag-phrases which distance the reader during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mara's transformation is driven entirely by external magic rather than internal agency; the tile "unlocks" her, dissolving her defining skepticism without genuine struggle or choice. The shift from hard data to "mathematics of empathy" is instantaneous, rendering her character arc passive. Her skepticism is discarded rather than tested, resulting in a low-friction protagonist who serves as a vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's boredom and desire are legible, but the emotional pivot relies on diagnostic interiority ("immortality wasn't a prison") rather than embodied reaction. The backstory of the "last love" remains summary, rendering the amulet's emotional value abstract until the moment it shatters.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on assertive labels ("mathematically honest," "rigid") rather than demonstrated behavior; the protagonist's transition from rigid honesty to using a magical cheat code is summarized rather than dramatized through struggle. The internal conflict is articulated in abstract, essayistic terms ("trajectory of justice") rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer with clear motivation (preservation). However, his grief (the daughter) feels like a texture rather than a live pressure forcing a difficult choice; he operates with a singular, conflict-free drive that limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist serves as a passive vessel for the concept, defined by habitual actions ("would touch," "moved") rather than specific choices under pressure. The internal arc is summarized as a state of being rather than dramatized through agency in a present-tense scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s defining trait as a "myth buster" dissolves instantly in the first paragraph without resistance or struggle, rendering the character arc flat. Her transition from twenty years of skepticism to accepting "liquid light" maps happens too easily, lacking the friction required for a credible internal shift. The emotional weight relies heavily on abstract longing for Mara rather than dramatized memories or specific, sharp regrets. Motivation is tied to a "universal riddle," which feels like a vagueness masquerading as depth.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maya is a competent focalizer, but her internal conflict ("dual allegiance") is summarized rather than dramatized through high-stakes hesitation or error. Her transition from "tormented" to resolved feels frictionless, lacking a moment where her competence is genuinely tested by the opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena's motivation is clearly delineated, rooting her professional duty in a personal legacy (the grandfather). Her choice to endure the hypothermic risk for the sake of the image demonstrates embodied agency, though the "purposefully curious" attribute feels slightly imposed rather than organic to her internal monologue.

    Mira's motivation (penance) is clear and drives the scene, and her competence is established through specific sensory engagement. However, the "magnetic calm" somewhat flattens the internal struggle, reducing the sense of immediate emotional cost during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlow is a consistent archetype defined by prompt labels ("dry-witted," "subtly confident") rather than dramatized internal conflict. He faces no contradictory impulses; his journey is a linear execution of competence without a moment of doubt or difficult choice that tests his character.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a ritual implement rather than a fully realized character; her defining trait ("infinitely patient") is repeated as a label rather than tested by frustration or delay. Lacking internal conflict or a difficult choice, she undergoes no change, leaving the emotional arc flat and the protagonist purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly anchored in her sister’s loss, providing a personal stake in the rescue mission. However, her primary problem-solving moment relies on a magical information download (“vision revealed the exit mechanism”) rather than active deduction, which dampens her intellectual agency. The climax requires a strong will to override instinct, effectively demonstrating courage, but the "collective wisdom" guiding her hands feels like a convenient shortcut for competence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is exceptionally well-integrated with the premise; Elias's internal struggle—fabricating a "truth" of disappearance to escape his father's legacy of lies—is profound and drives every on-page choice. The psychological cost of becoming a "rumor" is felt and specific. The protagonist's competence with "narrative physics" feels earned and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.3)
    Julian functions as a plot device rather than a character; he accepts the supernatural premise and his ancestral guilt instantly without the skepticism or struggle that defines human agency. The emotional progression relies on melodramatic summary ("ecstasy of recognition," "agony") rather than embodied reaction, making the connection feel performed.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on the "poetic wharf weaver" label and abstract interiority ("orchid solace threading through her heart") rather than demonstrated traits. Maren lacks internal contradiction or relational pressure, functioning more as an archetype than a fully realized protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("warmly curious nature") rather than embodied traits or distinct voice. The protagonist functions primarily as a thematic vehicle, with emotions summarized ("heart shift with cautious enchantment") rather than demonstrated through complex reactions under pressure. The repetition of the attribute "warmly curious" feels artificial, reducing the character to a prompt-fulfillment mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kael is a competent functionary who faces no internal contradiction, meaningful flaw, or moral trade-off. The "desperation" is asserted in narration rather than dramatized through difficult choices; the protagonist's success is linear and costless, lacking the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira is a distinct and compelling focalizer, her internal life perfectly synchronized with her external craft. The interplay between her "foolish" persona and her strategic brilliance creates a strong, sustained tension. The choice to reveal her true nature to the captain is a well-earned risk, though a slightly more visceral personal cost or moment of doubt would have pushed this to the very top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in a specific regret. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract emotional summaries ("love required only presence, not courage") rather than embodied psychological texture. The shift to "fierce tenderness" feels more like a labeled gear-shift than an organic emotional evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara functions as a noble archetype rather than a flawed individual under pressure; her traits are established via descriptors ("shrewdly innocent," "surgical precision") rather than revealed through difficult choices. Her motivation is abstractly stated in interiority ("graft new meaning") rather than dramatized through a struggle that carries visible personal cost. The characterization leans into the "helper" trope without sufficient internal contradiction or error to generate depth.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the emotional transition from "shuttered heart" to "mirthful dance" is smooth and lacks the friction of contradictory impulses on the page. The internal struggle is resolved through convenient environmental cooperation rather than a difficult, defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear but abstract ("exchange certainty for curiosity"). Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("the woman who had forgotten to wonder") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional arc feels theoretical, lacking the friction of genuine internal conflict or character-specific flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias functions effectively as an archetype ("charming rogue") but lacks deep internal contradiction or embodied fear, particularly at the climax. His reaction to capture—smiling with "relaxed confidence"—feels like a stock gesture that mutes the genuine emotional cost of his sacrifice. The motivation is explicitly stated ("Elias understood his motivation with crystalline clarity") rather than dramatized through the struggle of the choice itself.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a mythic archetype rather than a psychologically realized character; her "insomnia" and "grief" are stated traits rather than embodied experiences driving complex choices. Her transformation is a linear acceptance of a magical process without internal contradiction or resistance. The narrative relies on summary ("She sang of the enemy she had loved") rather than dramatized interaction to establish her history.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is a fitting archetype for this fable-like structure, with motivation clearly dramatized through the ritual. However, the emotional landscape relies heavily on labeled metaphors ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied reaction, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    Character interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("snarled knot of unspoken accusations") rather than specific, grounded memory or behavior. Julian functions primarily as a prop for the climax, offering no resistance or distinct agency until the final lines. The emotional arc feels theoretical, resolving via magical assertion rather than interpersonal chemistry or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a competent protagonist, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("profound emotional weight," "remembering with crystalline clarity") rather than embodied experience. The central emotional shift is summarized in a flashback ("Elias understood now") rather than dramatized in the present moment of the tremor. The character feels more like a vessel for the theme than a living presence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("lesson in vulnerability," "deepest motivation was not survival") rather than embodied experience. This abstraction creates emotional distance during pivotal moments of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions primarily as an intellectual decoder of the story's themes rather than a deeply felt presence; her motivation ("why some thresholds felt sacred") is abstract. While her internal logic is consistent, the emotional cost of being "lost" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated ("rhythm of belonging") but functions more as a thematic label than a driver of difficult choices; her connection to the ghost lacks friction or development. The emotion is performed through metaphor ("conscience," "blooming like lights") rather than dramatized through behavior or distinct interiority. The protagonist feels like a vessel for the prompt’s lyrical requirements rather than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or grit; she observes and philosophizes but faces no difficult choice. The resolution (acceptance of "missing pieces") arrives via immediate realization rather than earned struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.5)
    Kael is a cipher who succeeds effortlessly, lacking the internal contradiction or flawed humanity required for a compelling protagonist. His competence is absolute and unopposed, reducing him to a plot device rather than a living character who must make difficult choices under pressure. The motivation is stated in exposition but never tested by resistance or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist encounters no genuine resistance or difficult choice; the transition is a linear procedural of a decision already made. Embodiment is present but relies on abstract "aching" rather than visceral struggle, and the character reads more as a vehicle for the ritual than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("interference patterns") rather than embodied emotion or visceral want. The character analyzes his feelings with diagnostic distance, and the decision to return feels more like a philosophical conclusion than a high-stakes personal choice driven by the "trembling hands."

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is legible, but interiority relies on elaborate metaphors ("burns mapping constellations") rather than embodied sensation. The mentor-student dynamic lacks friction, with Elias functioning primarily as a prompt for Maya's monologue rather than a distinct agent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a cipher for the concept rather than a living character; her interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak ("logical dreamer," "coefficient") rather than embodied emotion or contradiction. She faces no difficult choices or competence limits, and the stated "burden" and exhaustion are not dramatized through visible cost or trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("sensitively perceptive nature") rather than dramatized traits. Mara functions as a passive observer without contradictory impulses or internal struggle; her emotional arc is a linear acceptance of a stated "burden" without a visible cost or hard choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; his motivation is stated ("needed them to see") rather than felt through internal contradiction or specific backstory. He lacks a personal cost or difficult choice beyond the exertion of his trade.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is a competent focalizer with clear agency, but the supporting cast feels archetypal, particularly the child who functions as a sentimental prop rather than a character. The General's rapid emotional pivot from bitterness to compliance lacks sufficient on-page interiority or relational friction to feel fully earned. Motivation is stated clearly, but the "operatively gentle" attribute feels like an imposed label rather than a lived trait.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's central action—destroying a valley to perform a private ritual of grief—is a powerful dramatization of the "amoral philanthropist" trait. However, the characterization relies on melodramatic summary in the backstory ("weeping alone in his study") rather than trusting the scene to convey his sentimental duality.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lys is a distinct, high-concept archetype whose motivation to "harvest echoes" drives the narrative effectively. However, her interiority is heavily filtered through stylized metaphors (e.g., "virginity a blade"), creating a poetic distance that keeps her emotional struggle slightly abstract despite the clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear, but the internal pivot relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("He realized," "He understood") rather than embodied struggle. The protagonist receives the climax's insight passively from a convenient mirror character rather than wrestling it from the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and powers the ritual, but she functions more as a vehicle for the "esoteric realist" philosophy than a fully embodied character. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract thematic labels ("metaphysical weight," "arithmetic of loss") rather than contradictory, felt emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is defined by a clear past failure and a present competence, but the internal conflict regarding forgiveness feels partially resolved in backstory ("But that was before she had forgiven herself") rather than fully dramatized in the scene. The ending suggests a final thaw, but the lack of active struggle or difficult choice reduces the character's dynamic range. Her agency is exerted through technical skill rather than difficult moral or tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, blending mythic duty with personal stagnation. Her shift from guardian to walker is motivated by a well-articulated internal decay that mirrors the bunker's state. The name "Foresight Hindsight" is distracting and allegorical, reading more like a label than a character, but the interiority overcomes this constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elior’s transition from miser to mystic is brilliantly executed; the recontextualization of his frugality as "hoarding belief" creates a profound, character-specific closure. The internal contradiction is active in every choice, resolving with a felt cost that inextricably links his defining flaw to his final triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is a consistent archetype of the "wise mentor" but lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle. The "scheming" trait is asserted in exposition ("schemes had mapped every pathway") rather than dramatized through difficult, high-stakes maneuvering on the page; his victory is achieved through a pre-planned procedure that works instantly without forcing him to adapt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is defined chiefly by the repeated label "firmly grounded" rather than through complex internal friction or distinct voice. While competent, his struggle remains external and procedural, lacking a dramatized emotional cost that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clearly dramatized through the shift from professional obligation to personal reconciliation. Her quartz prosthetic eyes are not just cosmetic but shape her perception of the work ("stress fractures"), grounding the fantasy element in character reality. The internal monologue regarding "deciduous vows" feels slightly expository, telling the reader her emotional conclusion rather than letting it emerge solely from the action. However, the decision to abandon the professional kit for the grandmother’s tools is a strong, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation to unlock the forbidden knowledge is clear and drives the narrative, though her "bewilderment" feels more stated than enacted; she moves with a ritualistic certainty that contradicts the label. The internal realization of her dual role as creator and curator effectively resolves her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is a distinct, competent professional whose worldview filters every observation. The shift from a standard rescue to a conceptual preservation is earned through her interaction with the setting, though the pivot relies slightly on a realized epiphany ("understanding suddenly") rather than a forced dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's abstract concepts rather than as a living character. Interiority consists of philosophical assertions ("realizing too slowly that the creature... was not nightmare but kin") rather than embodied emotion or distinct personality traits.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is functionally competent but lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle. Characterization relies on labels ("warmly methodical," "adaptable archivist") rather than dramatized personality, and her flawless success comes without the necessary emotional or psychological cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a competent focalizer with a distinct skill set, but she lacks internal contradiction or a dilemma that forces a difficult choice. The resolution relies on her procedural expertise without exacting a personal or emotional cost, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions as a competent executor of destiny rather than a character under pressure; meaningful internal conflict is absent. The "burden" of her gift is stated as a label but never dramatized as a cost or obstacle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to preserve memory is well-established and embodied in her actions. The shift from observer to participant at the climax feels thematically earned, though the emotional transition from archivist to dissolved consciousness is somewhat rapid and abstract. The internalization of the "sculpt identity" motivation anchors the character well despite the brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian is a competent, proactive protagonist with a clear goal, but his journey lacks deep internal conflict or vulnerability. He functions more as a magical technician than a character undergoing a personal crucible; his success feels inevitable due to his high competence and the abstract nature of the opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya functions primarily as a thematic mouthpiece; attributes like "warmly observant" are applied as labels rather than demonstrated through costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s motivation is distinct and drives the action through a clear arc, fulfilling the quest. However, her internal landscape relies heavily on stylized metaphors ("coiled in her blood," "empire of safety") rather than raw, embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara acts as a competent functionary without internal conflict or limits; her ability to heal is absolute, leaving no room for doubt or struggle. The "fluidly logical" trait is applied as a repetitive label rather than dramatized through difficult choices or tradeoffs. The passenger remains a passive recipient of the protagonist's expertise, preventing genuine relational dynamics or shared pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions more as a camera for the setting than a character with internal conflict; her motivation is singular and unchecked by doubt or opposing desires. The trait "wisely adventurous" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through a difficult choice, and her final decision lacks a felt personal cost since she never genuinely desired the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characters function as allegorical vessels rather than people, speaking in diagnostic themes ("I burned the bridges so you would learn to swim") rather than natural dialogue. The emotional progression is theoretical and lacks embodied resistance; Elias surrenders his isolation immediately, making his motivation feel like a plot device rather than a character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya’s internal landscape is vivid but relies heavily on explanatory telling rather than dramatized traits. The attribute "virtuously mischievous" is asserted twice as a label rather than demonstrated through a tricky or cunning choice on the page. While her guilt is clear, her pivotal decision is passive—following instructions from the texts—rather than a proactive assertion of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.1)
    Kael functions as a cipher for the plot rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or embodied emotion. The "dynasty ender" identity is stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices; they face no resistance and pay no personal cost beyond "sweat," making the ultimate triumph feel unearned and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or distinct personhood beyond the "obsessive quest"; he functions as a procedural vessel for the ritual rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The motivation is abstract and stated rather than felt through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict (duty to cull vs. need to preserve) drives the narrative arc effectively. However, her characterization relies heavily on the label "broken-hearted" rather than dramatized specificities of her own grief, making the connection to the files feel slightly abstract until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation ("right to remember"), but he relies on a label-only trait ("stutter") that never manifests in the scene or complicates action. The "underestimated" quality is stated rather than dramatized through an interaction; his competence is high, but the internal struggle is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias acts as a competent functionary of the plot rather than a complex character. His motivation is clear (counter the prophecy), but his internal landscape is largely expository ("remembered why he had returned") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The emotional cost is stated ("sorrow") but feels like fuel for the magic system rather than a deeply felt personal burden.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear internal conflict (order vs. wildness) that mirrors the plot. However, his pivotal realization about the monuments relies on an unearned knowledge leap rather than character-derived deduction, slightly flattening his agency in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict between rigid calibration and necessary improvisation is well-dramatized, particularly in the climactic stepping-stone sequence. Her motivation to exonerate the admiral provides a clear, compelling drive that unites her professional identity with the plot. However, the initial characterization relies slightly on label-heavy phrasing ("methodical patience," "uncertainly certain") rather than showing these traits exclusively through action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal landscape of regret is vivid. However, her competence is so high that the central struggle feels more like a procedural execution than a moment of doubt or difficult choice; the emotional resolution is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is clear but delivered via expository summary ("to integrate laughter into healing") rather than embodied struggle. The protagonist's "fearlessness" is asserted by label rather than tested by a difficult choice, though the physical cost (blood) adds some weight.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the story's extended metaphors than as a living character. Heavy reliance on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "trauma responses," "somatic memory," "proprioceptive map") in peak beats creates clinical distance rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is a competent professional with a clearly articulated motivation rooted in backstory ("grandmother's stories evaporate"). However, the narrative lacks immediate personal stakes or internal conflict; she performs her task with expert ease, facing no doubts or meaningful costs that challenge her character. The emotional weight is described ("weight of the nanny's grief") but treated as a procedural burden rather than a crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya is a distinct professional with a unique worldview ("ghosts as mechanical systems") that effectively grounds the fantasy. However, her competence is absolute and she faces no internal struggle or meaningful resistance, making the character arc feel static and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a conflicted individual; her motivation is stated ("had never wavered") rather than dramatized through struggle. She faces external resistance from the "machine" and "reality," but lacks the internal contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices that create deep characterization. The singular focus makes her an effective vehicle for the concept but limits emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's internal arc from revolutionary to gardener is coherent and moving, anchored by the closure choice. However, his victory in the central conflict relies on the "burnished sorrow" of his voice rather than active agency or intellect, making the climax feel unearned by character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias functions effectively as a mythic archetype but lacks the internal contradiction or psychological depth required for higher bands. He passes the story’s central test—absolute truth—instantly and without struggle, making him an idealized vessel rather than a character making a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is a distinct, competent lead with a specific worldview ("places rain had never touched") and consistent voice. However, the characterization lacks internal friction; her skills (including the convenient psychometry) easily overcome obstacles, leaving her devoid of contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist acts as a vessel for the prompt's required traits rather than a living character; labels like "perpetually learning" substitute for dramatized curiosity. Her internal arc is resolved instantly by an unearned epiphany from the slide, bypassing genuine struggle or contradictory impulses. The decision to "reimagine" her art feels like a convenient switch rather than a choice forged in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear, and the connection between her art and grief is well-drawn. However, the attribute "quietly driven" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through friction; her epiphany relies heavily on the sexton explaining the theme to her, rather than an active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias is a functional vessel for the concept, defined almost entirely by his "solemn duty" and the "haunting possession." While his physical reactions (trembling fingers) are grounded, he lacks a specific, dramatized internal struggle or contradictory impulse; his shift from archivist to confronter is asserted in summary rather than earned through difficult micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara functions well as a thematic agent with clear agency, actively rejecting the "easy" path. However, her internal struggle is somewhat intellectualized and brief ("rejected false comfort with the same ferocity"), lacking the visceral, embodied messiness of a character pushed to their absolute limit.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a consistent, atmospheric protagonist who aligns perfectly with the story's fable-like tone, but he lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. His primary action—consuming the wax shaving—feels like an inevitable step in a ritual rather than a difficult choice between competing values, reducing the dramatic weight of the transformation. While his motivation to archive is clear, the lack of hesitation or struggle makes him function more as a vessel for the concept than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara possesses strong interiority and a clear role, but she functions primarily as a vessel for the ritual rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure. The conflict is external and atmospheric; she faces no internal contradictions or moments of potential failure, resulting in a competence-heavy arc lacking a "crucible" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara is consistent but lacks internal conflict; her decision seems predetermined at dawn, reducing the scene's dramatic pressure. The attribute "credibly curious" is applied as a label rather than a dramatized trait, and the character functions more as a vehicle for the prompt than a living agent. Motivation is stated clearly, but the lack of struggle or hesitation makes the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian functions more as a passive vessel for the theme than an agent of drama; his motivation ("spiritually curious") is stated rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The "dance" feels like a performative beat rather than a driven reaction to pressure, and he lacks the contradictory impulses needed to make his final surrender feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a compelling vessel for the story's mood; his transition from passive recluse to active "keeper" is earned through internal processing. The physical manifestation of his astonishment—stillness rather than gasps—is a strong character detail. The "cost" of his choice is legible: a lifetime of bearing the weight of the unsaid.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, but her struggle remains largely abstract and internal. The physical risk (cutting her hand) is minor compared to the heavy conceptual stakes, leaving the survival pressure felt through exposition rather than immediate on-page threat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions as a flawless archetype rather than a person. The dialogue is didactic and unnatural, with the character delivering a thematic sermon ("Sometimes the break is where the story begins") rather than engaging in a believable interaction with a frightened child.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias functions as a stoic archetype rather than a fully realized character; his "brazen calm" removes internal friction, leaving him with no contradictory impulses to navigate. He accepts his death immediately and works without doubt, resulting in a flat emotional arc defined by competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("luminous skeptic") rather than dramatized choice, and her internal state lacks contradictory impulses. The cast functions as a chorus of agreement, offering no interpersonal friction or pressure to test her convictions.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.0)
    The coachman is an archetype of competence, defined by his role and "vast patience" rather than internal contradiction or struggle. He faces no difficult choices or conflicting impulses, serving as a vessel for the ritual rather than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's interiority fluctuates between grounded sensory details appropriate for a canine and abstract human philosophizing ("cartography of the heart," "physics but persistence") that breaks the POV. The emotional core is strong, but the intellectualized concepts attributed to the dog undermine the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s internal state is richly realized, with her "blessed pariah" status providing a clear, paradoxical motivation for her survival and method. The physical toll of the time dilation on her movements grounds her emotional struggle effectively. Her transition from endurance to active exploration is well-motivated by the family connection.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist functions as a collection of thematic labels ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") rather than a person with embodied struggle. Internal conflict is absent; despite mentions of altitude sickness, Kael operates with perfect confidence and delivers articulate speeches without hesitation. The character arc is a flat trajectory of competence where he simply performs the required ritual without genuine doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist serves as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; her background as a "crisis actor" is stated in summary rather than dramatized through distinct behavior. Motivation is handled via abstract interiority ("burned with a benevolently ruthless clarity") rather than conflicting impulses or difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is distinct, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic interiority ("Vey understood suddenly... buried talents... comprehension") rather than dramatized struggle. This intellectualization of the arc reduces emotional immediacy at the climax, as the character explains their own psychology to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation to find absolution is clearly established, but the climax relies on an external prop (the labyrinth's mirror) to deliver the pivotal epiphany rather than internal struggle. The shift from deep guilt to total acceptance happens instantly upon seeing the "truth" in the object, bypassing the necessary emotional processing and agency required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between artistic purity and necessary surrender drives the narrative arc effectively. Kael’s realization that "true refraction required surrender" is a well-earned pivot that resolves the external plot through character growth. The cost of this choice—losing their voice to the bone—is embodied and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and the internal conflict regarding her "uncertainty" is established, though often stated ("never certain," "old doubt") rather than dramatized through hesitation in the physical tasks. The emotional connection to the mentor is palpable, but the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction ("reading the topography of grief") rather than embodied feeling. The arc from doubt to "absolute belief" is a satisfying, if slightly rapid, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character motivation is deeply grounded in grief and artistry, driving agency from the first line. The transition from the "weight of absolution" to the act of painting feels earned and embodied, though the phrasing of his internal state occasionally leans into melodramatic abstraction ("weight of absolution") rather than purely shown emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but his internal landscape relies heavily on abstract labels ("purify intentions") rather than grounded psychology. His climax involves no struggle or hesitation, making him feel more like a vehicle for the thematic thesis than a character making a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist is vividly drawn as a fusion of biology and salvage, with interiority that effectively mirrors her physical state. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("cognitive precision," "desperation") and poetic abstraction rather than purely embodied reaction. The "realization" beat feels slightly intellectualized, mediated by the narrator's interpretation rather than the character's raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation to seek isolation is palpable and drives the narrative effectively. The involuntary truthfulness is excellently dramatized in the climax ("I am afraid"), anchoring the trait in action rather than just exposition. The internal shift from rational scientist to accepting "superstitions" is slightly rushed, summarized in interiority ("accepted that the superstitions...") rather than fully played out in a beat of hesitation or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maren is distinct and her endurance is palpable, but her interiority relies heavily on summarized metaphor ("eccentricities calcifying," "monument to... spring") rather than embodied, visceral reaction in the moment. The emotional progression is smooth but somewhat diagnostic, resolving the internal conflict through realization rather than a difficult, pressurized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arthur’s motivation is clearly rooted in the backstory promise, driving his risk-taking behavior. However, the explicit labeling of his intuition ("empirically intuitive") feels inserted rather than organically demonstrated, slightly flattening the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the mythic plot than a psychologically specific character; her "hollowness" and dread are conveyed through dense metaphor rather than grounded, contradictory behavior. The transition from fear to acceptance relies on a sudden, shared realization with Mara rather than a hard-won internal struggle, making her agency feel somewhat passive at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist faces no genuine internal conflict or character-testing choice. The interaction with Mira is frictionless; the "secret" acts as a convenient catalyst rather than a complication, resulting in a lack of relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s internal struggle against fragmentation is vivid and motivates the central action (chronicling). The "chronologically confused" state is dramatized well through the recursive confusion about the moss and stubble, grounding the abstract condition in physical reality. The shift from jealousy to acceptance is earned through the "soaring" perspective, though the emotional labeling ("feral nostalgia") occasionally tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("mapped her clients' emotional terrain," "liminal space") rather than dramatized interiority. Mara’s motivation is abstract ("to unveil ordinary miracles") and she faces no significant, conflicting impulses or difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s internal conflict between academic rationality and inherited superstition provides a solid narrative arc. Motivation is clear, but the interiority is occasionally flattened by the repetitive use of the epithet "budding rune scholar" and explicit telling of her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is incisive, blending professional cynicism with genuine remorse. Elara’s transition from protective metaphors to "raw and unadorned" speech constitutes a powerful, earned micro-turn that deepens the emotional stakes. The interaction with the ghost reveals a complex dynamic where forgiveness is offered but only partially received, avoiding a tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetypal functionary rather than a distinct character, with interiority consisting of abstract philosophy ("spiral arbitration") instead of embodied emotion. There is no internal conflict or felt personal cost; her journey is a procedural execution of a concept rather than a dramatized human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shepherd's motivation is laser-focused and creates strong internal pressure, culminating in the earned renunciation of the key. His interiority is distinct, though the emotional weight of the father's legacy could be dramatized with slightly more friction before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.5)
    Eli functions as a thematic mouthpiece rather than a realized character; his dialogue ("physics of letting go") is abstract and artificial. Maya's shift from professional intrusion specialist to sentimental observer happens too abruptly, unearned by the brief exchange. The emotional stakes are stated ("wildfire of restrained emotion") rather than dramatized through friction or credible hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya’s dual heritage as a statistician and a gambler's daughter provides strong internal texture. However, the epiphany ("teach differently") feels like a convenient resolution to an intellectual puzzle rather than a hard-won emotional shift born from immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara is a vividly drawn figure with a distinct, consistent worldview that drives her actions. The "teenager" beat offers a moment of genuine pressure where she must actively resist the temptation of "gratitude," demonstrating agency through her choice to disconnect (Earned Stasis). However, her character remains somewhat static; she operates as a philosophical force rather than a conflicted protagonist, executing a pre-set algorithm of "estrangement" without deeper internal struggle or doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is a distinct, competent focalizer whose internal landscape effectively grounds the speculative elements. The emotional arc lands a strong Earned Stasis, where her endurance of the "terrible joy" feels motivated and consistent. A slight reliance on abstract emotional labeling ("frequencies only the bereaved could hear") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a functional archetype of the "wounded healer," but his internal shift relies on a sudden, unearned epiphany triggered by a "magic child" prop rather than accumulated psychological pressure. The protagonist’s "desperately jocular" nature is asserted via label rather than dramatized through consistent behavior or costly blunders. While the motivation is clear, the resolution comes too easily, bypassing the necessary struggle to accept vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("grief," "longing") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The protagonist lacks genuine internal resistance; she desires to map the depths and simply does so without behavioral struggle or missteps. The epiphany feels unearned because the suppression is stated in summary rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "confidently uncertain" rather than dramatized complexity. While the internal state of guilt is established, the emotional arc feels functional and diagnostic rather than embodied, with the protagonist serving primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's required attributes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies on romanticized archetypes—the tortured artist and the mystical guide—rather than specific, contradicted interiority. Elias's deafness and Mara's whispering create a poetic conceit that strains physical credibility (she whispers encouragement he feels as warmth) without grounding the relationship in necessary, friction-filled interaction. The emotion is labeled ("joyful sorrow") rather than embodied through distinct, high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the story's thematic assertions rather than a living character making difficult choices in real-time. Her transition from arsonist to artist is summarized rather than dramatized, and her internal monologue relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("mineral regret," "covenant sealed in absence") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael’s grief is embodied through the specific action of drumming rather than abstract labels, grounding the "experimental patient" trope in visceral experience ("stimming" as navigation). The internal conflict between the clinical reality and his "quietly rebellious" hope is dramatized effectively in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael is a competent, distinct protagonist with a professional worldview that grounds the narrative. However, the character lacks the internal contradiction or "crucible" moment required for higher bands; Kael is a master of the domain who faces no genuine doubt or high-stakes internal struggle, resulting in a static display of skill rather than a character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The guardian functions as an atmospheric prop rather than a character with agency or risk. There is no internal conflict, contradictory impulse, or potential for failure; they are an idealized operator performing a script. Without a personal stake or the possibility of error, the character lacks the dimensionality required for literary engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias appears as a static sage figure who executes a plan without internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses, violating the 9+ requirement for struggle. The "unspoken words" attribute is summarized via montage rather than dramatized in a high-pressure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s internal struggle is summarized through abstract labels ("false self," "guarded heart") rather than dramatized via conflicted micro-choices. The transformation feels inevitable from the start, lacking the friction of a decision made under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a compelling figure whose contradictory past and present theatricality drive the scene. However, the "blank face" trait is over-described (four variations), and the "morally ambiguous" aspect relies on backstory summary rather than present-tense complication.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc relies on a sudden, unearned realization ("the ban had never been external") that contradicts the premise of waiting seven years for an external event. This pivoting insight feels like a convenience to force a thematic point rather than a dramatized psychological shift. The motivation is explicitly stated rather than revealed through friction or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal shift relies on a summarized epiphany ("Elara realized then...") rather than earned struggle. Labeled attributes like "innocently cunning" tell character traits rather than demonstrating them through complex action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is a distinct protagonist with a clear role, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract thematic labels like "texture of connection" rather than embodied emotion. Her rebellion lacks weight because the narrative validates it immediately, reducing the sense of genuine personal risk or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype (the wise healer) rather than a dynamic character under pressure; her motivation is stated ("to teach withering to bloom") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The interaction lacks genuine friction, as the young man serves primarily as a prompt for her expertise rather than a source of interpersonal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a conflicted protagonist; her certainty leaves no room for the contradictory impulses or internal struggle that drive high-band characterization. Elias exists primarily as a prompt for exposition, lacking agency or distinct interiority beyond his role as a foil. The dynamic is static, resembling a teacher-student lecture rather than a relationship under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority relies heavily on labeled emotions ("anguished joy," "trembled not with fear") rather than embodied reaction. The physical expression of her character through dance is a strong concept, but the internal conflict feels resolved before the scene begins; she is fully committed without hesitation or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist functions as a plot device with abstract motivation ("preserve the shape of hope") rather than embodied desire. Her internal state is conveyed through diagnostic labels ("metamorphosis of hope") rather than felt experience, and she faces no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s internal conflict regarding her complicity is clear, and the choice to testify provides valid closure. However, the psychological "peeling away" occurs largely in summary and retrospect ("spent seventy-two hours interrogating") rather than being dramatized through immediate, high-pressure choices in the scene. The symbolic action of undressing substitutes for a more rigorous, specific confrontation with her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer with clear, shifting motivations—from seeking surgical closure to accepting the role of a witness. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through his physical reaction to the "unwanted clarity" and the "telepathy" that manifests his grief. The final choice to break the hourglass and speak feels earned by the preceding introspection, though the shift from patient to explorer relies slightly on dream-logic permission.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a sensor for the premise rather than a character with conflicting impulses; her success is immediate and competence-based without a moment of doubt. The "spatially imaginative" trait is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or trade-off. There is no felt cost to the discovery, leaving her internal landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist reads more as an archetype of the "tortured artist" than a specific individual. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("stardust in their veins," "cage," "hollowed chest") rather than embodied human emotion or specific history. The character follows a set of instructions rather than making difficult choices that reveal personality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael functions as a capable vessel for the concept, with clear motivation rooted in the "dreamless" backstory. However, he lacks internal contradiction or active struggle; his "duty" encounters no meaningful hesitation or flaw, making him feel more like an archetype than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is a distinct and thoughtful protagonist, but his pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("It amplifies what we refuse to untangle") rather than embodied action. The emotional arc from fear to acceptance is articulated in dialogue rather than felt through subtext, which flattens the climax into a philosophical lecture. While the internal motivation is clear, the epiphany feels unearned because it resolves via explanation rather than a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara’s interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("anxiety had caged her," "reservoir of bravery") rather than embodied struggle. The realization about the leash feels like a stated therapeutic breakthrough rather than a discovery earned through the pressure of the scene. The guides function more as plot devices than characters with distinct agendas.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc is clear, moving from questioning to a redefined resolve. The parallel between nerve regeneration and the return of agency is effective, if slightly convenient. The motivation to understand the cost of safety drives the narrative well, though the internal monologue occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("questions burned like thawing embers") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a static instrument of destiny rather than an agent under pressure; he waits for a scheduled event without internal conflict. The antagonist is a caricature who delivers expository villain monologue ("maps I bribed... before I burned their cells"), reducing the confrontation's emotional weight to a formality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is rich and distinct, anchored by the tapping habit and her history as a witness. However, the climax relies on abstract summarization ("social forgetting," "institutional knowledge") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the felt cost of the realization. The transition from observer to active participant via the atlas page is a strong, character-specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("sought meaning") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices. Mira acts with a certainty that precludes internal friction; she lacks a visible flaw or limit that forces a struggle, resulting in a competence that lowers the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a distinct presence with clear motivation ("evolution with intent") and a specific history. However, her "insurgent" nature is asserted via backstory rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices; her actions are largely procedural execution of a pre-made decision.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct, grounded protagonist, and his coping mechanisms are specific. However, the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("somatic marker," "language of trauma") rather than embodied sensation, creating clinical distance during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mara’s internal transition from "crestfallen artist" to "cartographer of broken things" relies on abstract labels rather than dramatized psychological struggle. The epiphany feels asserted through summary—"Mara understood then"—rather than earned through character-specific decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the story's philosophical concept rather than as a living consciousness. Key traits like "serene anger" and "consciously wild" are delivered via expository labels rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. While the motivation is clear, the lack of embodied emotion or internal contradiction makes the character's final transcendence feel theoretical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("bravely conflicted," "moral crisis") rather than embodied struggle. The pivotal decision is rushed through a transition phrase ("within the blink..."), eliding the psychological processing of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya is consistent and her worldview is clear, but she remains static; her pacifism is a settled state rather than a contested stance tested by immediate pressure. The lack of contradictory impulses or internal struggle against the environment makes her feel more like a thematic vessel than a living character making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael is a competent, archetypal protagonist who executes a task with skill, but he lacks deep internal conflict or a pivotal choice between competing values. His "cool-headed" nature is stated and enacted, but his journey is linear and procedural rather than character-defining; he functions more as a vessel for the prose than a fully realized agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eleanor is distinct and competent, and her trait of being "devotedly observant" drives the investigation effectively. However, her decision to dismantle her empire lacks internal friction; she accepts the destruction of her fortune with "grace" and laughter, making the cost feel conceptually acknowledged but emotionally underweight.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (guilt) is viscerally established and drives the plot. The resolution, however, relies on external validation (the baby's cry translating to forgiveness) rather than a purely internal evolution, which slightly softens the character agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara serves as a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a realized character. The specific trait "socially perceptive" is misapplied to anthropomorphize stone ("feel the stone's anxiety") rather than navigating human dynamics, reading as a forced prompt insertion. Her internal experience is rendered through abstract metaphors ("pockets heavy with violet chalk") rather than grounded emotion or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael is distinct, but their success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle; the "trap" loosens without a visible sacrifice or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    Julian is consistent, but Mara functions largely as a passive prop for his redemption arc, lacking distinct interiority beyond generic despair. The transition from "encore-seeking" to selfless savior is rapid and lacks internal friction, making the character arc feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya is a distinct focalizer, but her defining trait of "skepticism" clashes with her uncritical reliance on a mystical dowsing method, creating a disconnect that feels convenient rather than complex. While her motivation is clear ("protective love"), her internal struggle is resolved through assertion rather than dramatized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael functions more as a camera than a character, observing without internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Interiority relies on abstract emotional labels ("sorrow and wonder") rather than embodied reactions, and the "consuming motivation" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.7)
    Elara functions as a cipher for the prompt rather than a living character; her interiority is abstract and devoid of contradictory impulses. The explicit statement of her goal ("She had succeeded in her motivation: to spin...") reads as meta-commentary rather than organic desire. There is no felt emotional cost or struggle in her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elena's internal landscape relies on genre archetypes ("burned," "ashes") and stated emotions rather than behavior under pressure. The transition from brokenness to "mended" feels asserted via summary rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is consistent but static, defined by abstract summaries of his internal state ("distill complexity into essence") rather than embodied struggle. The use of diagnostic label-speak in interiority distances the reader, and the lack of contradictory impulses results in a character who observes rather than makes difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kai is a consistent focalizer with a clear skillset ("sharp gentleness," kintsugi), but her internal landscape is serene to the point of flatness. The "master" backstory feels like a stock trope rather than a specific, lived memory. Her pivotal choice (leaving the glass) is symbolic but lacks a visceral, felt cost on the page; she moves through the story with the detachment of an observer rather than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s internal transition from gardener to guardian is clear, but her realizations are often delivered via summary ("Mara understood now...") rather than dramatized through pressure. The emotional arc feels somewhat predetermined, lacking the friction of a difficult, real-time choice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal conflict is legible, and the shift from mourning to independence is coherent. However, the motivation is delivered via diagnostic telling ("The motivation burned in her chest: to translate..."), and the emotional turning point relies on abstract realizations rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is legible, but the central pivot relies on a "bolt from the blue" epiphany ("struck her like the storm") rather than a pressured decision. The relationship with Mara lacks "crucible" pressure; her return is convenient and the reunion is friction-free, offering a symmetric satisfaction that bypasses the cost of the seventeen-year silence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena is a competent, proactive protagonist who drives the action. Her expertise is established well through specific actions (tracing charts, patching generators), but her internal landscape is somewhat generic ("fear coiling," "hands trembled"). The emotional arc is functional rather than deeply idiosyncratic; she fits the "capable scientist" archetype without subverting it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied ("lungs already tightened," "screaming mind"), driving the central tension effectively. The internal conflict between terror and purpose is strong. However, the use of diagnostic labels like "prudently adventurous instinct" and "wistful rebellion" in key beats slightly flattens the characterization, substituting telling for dramatized feeling in those specific moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's contradictory traits (prosopagnosia vs. portraiture) create a strong conceptual hook, but the pivot to empathy is told via summary ("She worked deliberately to awaken dormant empathy") rather than dramatized. The internal shift feels like a mechanical toggle flip rather than an earned evolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara functions efficiently as a vehicle for the backstory, but her internal life feels dictated by prompt labels ("nervously confident" inserted verbatim) rather than organic psychological pressure. The "nervously confident" trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and her interaction with the meteorologist lacks genuine friction or status negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions more as a vessel for thematic keywords than a living character; his interiority consists of abstract labels ("tension between span and void") rather than embodied emotion. The transition from trauma to healing feels mechanically driven by the magical prop rather than a hard-earned psychological turn. While motivation is clear, the resolution relies on a sudden, epiphany-induced shift that bypasses genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, internally consistent character whose motivation to understand his lineage drives the narrative. However, his interiority often slips into diagnostic label-speak ("necessary education," "economics of predation") rather than embodied experience, making the epiphany feel intellectually summarized rather than emotionally lived.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara is a coherent focalizer with a clear backstory, but her internal state lacks active struggle or contradictory impulses. The transition from grief to acceptance feels frictionless, relying on a sudden, unearned epiphany rather than a hard-won emotional shift. The lack of resistance or temptation to abandon the work flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is a consistent protagonist with a clear role, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("moments trapped between heartbeats") rather than visceral, embodied emotion. The shift in her "guarded heart" at the end is stated conceptually rather than dramatized through a difficult emotional choice, making the character arc feel slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s internal state is clearly defined, mixing terror and hope, though the "purposefully curious" trait relies on a stated label rather than demonstrated behavior. The relationship with Kael provides necessary history, but their dynamic is resolved quickly through cooperative action without significant friction or deeper psychological negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is grounded in concrete grief and drives the central action. However, the protagonist's defining trait ("reckless idealist") is applied as a label rather than purely demonstrated, and the internal shift at the end feels slightly smoothed over by the narrator's summary.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is robust, with the protagonist's internal conflict between the safety of facts and the "mathematics of longing" driving the narrative. The "confidently uncertain" trait is dramatized effectively in the climax, showing a clear shift in values. A slight reliance on diagnostic interiority ("Marcus realized," "insulating emotionally") prevents the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, and the transition from methodical observer to sacrificial vessel is internally consistent. However, the "haunted" quality of his ambition relies on summary labels ("His haunted ambitions had driven him") rather than dramatized struggle, and the emotional shift at the climax feels slightly accelerated for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The librarian is a compelling construct with physical limitations tied to the setting (moon phases), which grounds the character well. However, it functions as a dutiful agent rather than a protagonist making hard choices; there is no internal contradiction or moment where it must sacrifice a want for a need. The "resistance" of the identities is resolved through communication rather than a costly decision, leaving the character's arc relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motivation is delivered through retroactive exposition ("She understood now why...") rather than dramatized struggle. The pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("motivation had never been safety codes... but rather to dissolve the walls") immediately before the choice, flattening the character arc into a stated epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, with the withdrawal effects providing strong textural grounding for her choices. The tension between the numbness of medication and the pain of clarity drives the narrative effectively. However, her pivotal epiphany relies partly on external coincidence (the coordinates) rather than purely internal agency, slightly weakening the character's active role in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a viewpoint for the setting rather than an agent of dramatic choice; her "sole motivation" is established via summary rather than demonstrated need. There is no on-page internal conflict or emotional cost; she navigates the library's challenges with immediate competence, feeling "cautious exuberance" rather than the friction of a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict is tangible, grounding high-concept magic in a professional and ethical dilemma. The "mulberry ache" of the choice is earned through her reflection on provenance and history, though the dual gifts (plants and coffee stains) crowd the character's toolkit slightly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a procedural instrument rather than a character with agency or internal conflict; she faces no difficult choices that test her motivation. Her interiority is expository rather than embodied, and there is no struggle between contradictory impulses to generate depth.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and the internal conflict is legible, but the resolution relies on diagnostic label-speak ("understanding finally that contentment was not a destination") rather than embodied emotion. The character's "kindly decisive" trait is told via adjectives rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal paradox ("sincerely insincere") is excellent, driving the narrative voice and the central dilemma. The shift from selling absolution to offering ambiguity is a clearly motivated, character-specific change earned by the pressure of the specific client. The internal contradiction is embodied in action (holding the shard, unhooking the cloak) rather than just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's unique condition is explored with profound interiority ("memories becoming predictions"), grounding the high concept in specific emotional experience. His motivation to "teach vanishing" creates a compelling, paradoxical drive that sustains the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character functions effectively as a mythic archetype, and the transformation from seeker to landmark is legible. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or specific, embodied risk makes the internal journey feel inevitable rather than earned against resistance. The protagonist operates more as a vessel for the concept than a living agent making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a coherent protagonist with clear motivation and a distinct worldview that drives the central action. However, his internal realization ("understanding finally why he had failed") is delivered through expository summary rather than dramatized discovery, which slightly distances the reader from the moment of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a consistent, obsession-driven protagonist whose singular focus anchors the piece. His internal motivation is clear, though the lack of on-page hesitation or conflicting impulses flattens the dramatic arc; he functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena functions more as a cosmic operator than a fully realized character, with her interiority largely defined by the required prompt labels ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt") rather than contradictory embodied emotion. While her competence is clear, the lack of a personal, non-functional desire or a struggle against a flaw limits empathy. The character serves the high-concept premise well but lacks the idiosyncratic spark of a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    The Reaper’s internal state is richly drawn, and the pivot from harvester to witness is a compelling trajectory. However, the emotional arc feels slightly linear, moving from stasis to epiphany without significant internal resistance or contradiction during the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s specific limitation (lukewarm magic) compels a grounded, persistent methodology that defines her character well. However, interiority relies too heavily on the repetition of static labels ("earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") rather than dramatized emotional contradictions or choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear internal shift from maintaining the dam to preserving truth. However, his reaction to the "trail of photographs" relies on a suspension of disbelief regarding their preservation and convenient arrangement, which slightly flattens the agency of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is defined by labels ("severe scholarly knots," "secretly sentimental") rather than choices made under pressure. The central internal conflict—logic versus intuition—is resolved by a sudden, unearned realization rather than a struggle that forces a painful trade-off. Her "secret sentimentality" functions as a plot key for the climax rather than a flawed trait that complicates her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is defined by hyper-competence, effectively dramatizing the "pattern seeker" archetype, but lacks internal contradiction or genuine flaw. The "burden" is stated explicitly in interiority rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice that forces a tradeoff; her success feels inevitable due to her mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear, but the characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ego death," "numbness") rather than embodied behavior. The emotional breakthrough at the climax feels unearned because the internal struggle is summarized through abstract realization rather than dramatized friction. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the philosophical concept than a living entity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on exposition and summary rather than dramatized action; Maya is a cipher for the premise whose motivation is stated directly ("safeguard space for innovation") rather than revealed through difficult choices or resistance in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and singular, driving the narrative effectively. However, the characterization remains largely conceptual; Elias exists more as a metaphor (the "mad composer") than a fully realized consciousness with contradictory impulses or grounded interiority. The emotional stakes are described through heavy abstraction ("swallowed sobs forming stalactites") rather than specific, embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist is vividly realized, blending feral instinct ("licked her chops") with high-concept interiority. Her renunciation of home is motivated by a specific sensory memory ("rigid geometry," "static of certainty"), earning the closure. The transition from homesickness to acceptance is rapid but credible within the dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marcus's internal landscape is detailed but relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("calcified into regret," "hopeless alchemist") rather than embodied emotion. The repetition of the trait "stoically sensitive" reads as a prompt insertion rather than an organic character detail.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara is competent but static; her lack of internal conflict or fear in the face of "lethal" stakes flattens the tension. The resolution validates her skills without demanding a personal price or trade-off, resulting in a low-stakes character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on the label "resiliently positive," which is asserted rather than dramatized through difficult choices or costs. Elias functions as a plot device to operate the radio rather than a fully realized protagonist with internal conflict; his "ardent" nature is told, not shown through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s agency is clear and her choice to merge with the architecture is earned by the accumulative logic of the piece. However, her motivation is stated abstractly ("discover the texture of connection") rather than felt through conflicting human desires, keeping her interiority somewhat clinical and distant.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is a competent, driven protagonist with clear motivation rooted in survival. However, her interiority relies heavily on labeled emotions ("somber marvel," "grief") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment, and she succeeds without facing a flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena's internal conflict between her bureaucratic role and the "uninvited" heroism is well-dramatized, anchoring her shift from observer to rescuer. Her motivation is consistently embodied ("heart hammered," "breath visible"), though the antagonist's ability to keep a child hidden for forty years renders the secondary character dynamics slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara's internal conflict is compelling, but the narrative relies on diagnostic labels ("particular neurosis," "contradiction that had defined her existence") rather than dramatized behavior to establish it. The climax of her arc—claustrophobia "shattering"—is summarized as an abstract state change rather than experienced through visceral, embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is a proactive protagonist who translates her trauma into a concrete physical methodology (the counting, the ink). However, the epiphany regarding her status as an "anomaly" who "evolved beyond binary" feels like a diagnostic label inserted by the author rather than a realization fully earned through the scene's struggle. The transition from survival to living is neatly executed but relies slightly on this summarized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is a compelling mythic archetype, but her interiority is functional rather than deeply embodied; she lacks contradictory impulses or a difficult micro-choice on the page. The "dimming" at the end suggests a physical cost, but because she explicitly chooses a path to avoid the sacrifice of her voice, the decision lacks the friction of a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's internal progression from bitterness to acceptance is legible, but the emotion is often intellectualized through abstract metaphor ("lighter than regret") rather than visceral reaction. Her motivation is clear, but the "disguise" element feels vestigial since no external threat enforces it during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a complex character; her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or distinct flaws. The "insurgent of beauty" role grants her perfect competence, removing the possibility of genuine personal cost or struggle beyond the magical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marek is a consistent, competent protagonist, but his motivation and traits are largely delivered through exposition ("respectfully rebellious," "driven only by the need") rather than emerging from difficult on-page choices. He encounters no significant internal conflict or character-specific obstacles; he simply performs his duty as described.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by his backstory, but his internal journey feels abstract and summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The resolution—regaining his voice—is triggered by a magical object rather than earned through agency or struggle, bypassing the necessary psychological cost of ending thirteen years of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is stated clearly, but the protagonist faces no internal resistance, doubt, or contradictory impulses. The attribute "sanely eccentric" acts as a functional label to justify her skills rather than a flawed, lived reality with visible social cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated, but her emotional interiority is rendered through heavy abstraction rather than embodied reaction. The "hollow" feeling is asserted via metaphor rather than felt through contradictory impulses or behavioral resistance. She functions more as a vehicle for the magic system than a fully realized protagonist making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    Vey serves as an archetypal vehicle for the concept rather than a character with internal contradictions or distinct psychology. Her "quiet fearlessness" removes the possibility of genuine struggle or doubt, leaving her competence unchallenged by the narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is grounded in a clearly defined, lifelong burden of guilt and curiosity, with the protagonist's competence well-established. The internal pivot from observer to participant is legible, though the pivotal decision relies slightly on expository interiority ("time was now") rather than a dramatized pressure point in the moment. The emotional arc is coherent, shifting from caution to necessary risk.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara has a distinct voice and the physical trait (walking backwards) provides a clear external marker for her internal arc, resolving nicely at the end. However, the child remains a prop until the climax, and the diagnosis relies on label-speak ("chose to hide instead of push through") rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elian is an archetype defined by labels ("wise," "insatiably creative") rather than a specific consciousness with internal contradictions. His motivation is noble but abstract ("preserve the color of wonder"), and he lacks the flawed, contradictory interiority required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is compelling, and the choice to break her own mask to better understand fracture adds significant depth to her character. The transformation from restorer to vessel is earned through the on-page work and the visible accumulation of silence. A minor flaw is the diagnostic nature of her dialogue ("Only a cracked vessel..."), which explicitly states her psychology rather than letting the subtext carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s professional background as a map framer is integrated well into her worldview ("errors of ink vs. errors of truth"). However, her motivation ("to interpret silence with empathy") feels inserted as a prompt-required label rather than arising organically from the scene's pressure. The final choice to leave the map torn is a strong character beat that earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian is drawn with a consistent, analytic interiority that suits the tone, and his motivation is clear. However, Death functions more as a static prop than a character; their "camaraderie" is stated but lacks dynamic interplay or testing on the page. The relationship feels ornamental rather than a crucible for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("sought to articulate unspoken needs") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The protagonist faces no internal conflict or genuine risk; her emotional connection to the ghost is summarized ("learned to love") rather than earned in scene. The lack of embodied reaction or cost leaves the character feeling like a functional vehicle for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal journey from servant to spiritual heir is coherent, but her motivation and emotional shifts rely on diagnostic labels (“warmly inquisitive,” “affectionate detachment”) rather than dramatized subtext. The realization of her inheritance is intellectually clear but emotionally summarized, distancing the reader from the felt experience of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist relies on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "shame-gray nimbostratus," "quietly explosive grief") rather than embodied emotion, creating a detached, therapeutic interiority during a life-threatening crisis. The immediate acceptance of the break as "necessary severance" removes internal conflict too early, rendering her a passive observer of her own survival.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is distinct and competent, with strong sensory embodiment via her tactile perception. However, she lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses; her drive is singular and purely aligned with the plot task, creating a functional rather than complex character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a conflicted protagonist; her "sociable isolation" is expository backstory that never creates present-tense friction. The primary trait ("diligently curious") is a label, and her emotional arc is a smooth ascent to victory without the contradictory impulses or trade-offs required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is a competent functionary for the plot but lacks internal contradiction or distinct personality traits beyond her role. The central epiphany about "listening" to the metal feels unearned, as she faces no genuine failure or internal resistance before succeeding.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara’s internal journey from mistrust to kinship is legible but smoothed over by rapid summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her emotional arc feels inevitable rather than earned by friction, as the ghost's instructions remove the burden of leadership decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara functions as a consistent vessel for the ritual, but she lacks internal conflict or resistance; her journey is strictly procedural. Emotional states are often told via diagnostic labels ("sacred motivation," "bruised awe") rather than embodied in specific micro-reactions, distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is firmly rooted in the specific, tragic backstory of her brother, creating a believable reluctance that adds depth to her competence. Her internal state balances successfully between resentment and duty, driving the narrative arc. The "graceless beauty" motif, while thematically relevant, is over-applied to the point of becoming a label rather than an embodied trait.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is distinct and grounded in the chemist persona, but the internal arc feels intellectualized rather than embodied. The resolution—channeling grief into a polymer design—reads as a retreat into the very abstraction the antagonist (Maya) criticized, yet the narrative frames it as unironic growth, muddling the character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compels the narrative arc; her transition from vendor to elemental silence is a decisive change earned by the on-page action of measuring and cutting. The "glimmering parole" provides effective external pressure that contrasts with her internal desire, though the emotional texture is somewhat cool and detached, fitting the "clean slate" persona but limiting visceral intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael acts as a competent vessel for the concept rather than a character under pressure; her success feels inevitable due to her defined powers. The "cost" of the emotional contagion is stated ("abrasive against her psyche") but resolved quickly without a moment of doubt or meaningful trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a character; she lacks internal conflict, flaws, or distinct interiority beyond her role. Her motivation is stated as determination rather than dramatized through struggle, and she faces no micro-choices that test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("cognitive dissonance," "synaptic plasticity") rather than embodied emotion, creating a detached, clinical distance. Elena functions more as a vessel for the prompt's concepts than a human agent; her struggle is described through abstract metaphors of engineering rather than felt, visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as a competent archivist with a distinct cognitive trait ("prism-minded"), but she lacks internal conflict or vulnerability. Her success is achieved through perfect preparation and innate ability, with no moment of doubt or struggle to deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara is functionally competent but lacks internal contradiction or a distinct personality beyond her role. Her motivation is clear, yet she faces no difficult micro-choices that force her to prioritize values or pay a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Castian’s internal state is richly detailed, and his motivation to restore the covenant is clear. However, the pivotal realization ("exile had not been punishment but preparation") is delivered as a summarized epiphany rather than a fully dramatized psychological shift, which slightly distances the reader from the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("eclectic pacifist," "theatrical sincerity") rather than embodied traits. His motivation is stated in theoretical terms without a felt, personal cost on the page; the "tears of theatrical sincerity" read as performative description rather than genuine emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is clearly defined, but her interiority relies on abstract summary ("emotional architecture") rather than visceral reaction. The choice to plant is pre-determined and meets no resistance; the narrative lacks a moment where her ambition is truly tested against her sensitivity or environment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael functions as a competent observer rather than a protagonist under pressure; she faces no internal contradictions or difficult trade-offs. Her arc is purely additive—she gains knowledge and safety without paying a personal price or overcoming a character-specific flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya is a competent professional with a distinct, obsessive worldview that fits the procedural mode. The final "smile" creates a necessary layer of complexity, suggesting an aesthetic appreciation of disaster that complicates her heroism, though internal conflict remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a realized character. She lacks internal contradiction or meaningful micro-choices; she simply executes a pre-ordained ritual without doubt or personal cost. The emotional landscape is described via synesthetic labels rather than embodied reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is clear but delivered through diagnostic summary ("painfully certain," "paralyzed by the weight") rather than embodied struggle. The central realization is stated as an abstract thesis ("guardianship had never been about static defense") rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a compelling, proactive protagonist with a clear, obsessive drive that creates immediate narrative momentum. However, her "borrowed personalities" function more as magical tools than character depth, and her lack of internal conflict or hesitation regarding the cartographer's destruction makes her feel slightly mechanical. The interaction is one-sided, treating the antagonist as a prop rather than a character with genuine agency, which limits the emotional complexity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly drawn with a specific trait (jittery) and a distinct internal conflict. However, his transformation is swift and aided significantly by the magical prop, making the internal change feel less earned by psychological struggle or grit. The character arc functions well for a fable but lacks the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a competent observer rather than a protagonist under pressure; she faces no internal doubt, contradiction, or deficit. Her success is immediate and absolute, lacking the struggle or blind spots required to give her agency emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is stated via exposition ("burned within her like a hidden ember") rather than dramatized through conflicted behavior prior to the climax. Extensive use of filter verbs ("sensed," "understood," "realized") creates distance, summarizing internal states instead of embodying them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara is defined by labels ("meek," "quietly determined") rather than contradictory impulses or difficult choices on the page. Her transformation ("no longer merely a blacksmith") is stated as a conclusion rather than earned through a dramatized struggle where her meekness forced a costly trade-off. The characterization is functional for a fable but lacks the specific interiority or agency required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is clearly defined by her role, but her interiority relies heavily on summary verbs like "realized" and "understood" rather than dramatized processing. The emotional weight of her mentor's betrayal is stated abstractly ("accumulated grief") rather than felt through visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict—desire for connection versus the safety of silence—is poignant and well-dramatized through the renunciation of the letter. The explicit articulation of her motivation ("to bottle the feeling of safety") feels slightly diagnostic and expository, but her actions consistently support this drive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael functions as a vessel for the prompt's concepts rather than a realized character; he lacks contradictory impulses or genuine interiority. His emotions are described through abstract metaphors ("tasted like ink") rather than embodied feeling, and he faces no difficult choices, merely executing a procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with the donor organ is compelling, but the resolution relies on diagnostic interiority rather than dramatized choice. The epiphany ("warning that beauty and fragility shared the same molecular structure") reads more like an essayistic summary than an embodied realization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her progression feels linear and lacks internal conflict. The healing attribute functions as a convenience that lowers physical cost rather than a constraint that forces difficult choices. The epiphany regarding the trees is sudden and observational rather than earned through character pressure or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions more as a magical mechanism than a character with interior life. She lacks contradictory impulses, doubts, or distinct personality traits beyond her role as a "memory keeper," and her progression from fragmented to whole feels like a reward rather than an earned evolution through difficult choice. The narrative tells us her motivation ("burning like cold fire") rather than dramatizing the personal stakes of her fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic heart") rather than dramatized behavior. Elias's internal state is conveyed through abstract summary ("tidal emotions") rather than grounded reaction, and the "empathic sense" functions as a convenient shortcut to avoid genuine interpersonal friction. The emotional arc is too tidy, lacking the messy, conflicted texture of a real dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.0)
    Mara acts as a thematic vessel rather than a living character; her motivation is stated as a philosophical thesis ("to find the sacred in the ordinary") rather than dramatized through struggle. She lacks internal contradiction or embodied cost; her journey is a linear execution of a plan without doubt or friction. The "creeping normality noticer" label feels like a diagnostic tag rather than an organic trait revealed through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s internal conflict between procedural discipline and existential despair is rendered with precision. The tension is embodied in her "trembling palms" versus her "gently meticulous" movements, creating a character whose professional competence is her only shield against grief. The shift from desperate documentation to solemn witness feels earned and deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and the "feigned drunkenness" tactic effectively utilizes her background. However, interiority relies too heavily on the repeated label "comforting unease" rather than embodied emotion, flattening her internal landscape. The "stolen memories" reference creates a jarring genre inconsistency with the otherwise grounded moonshine runner persona.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara is defined primarily by the label "luminous skeptic" rather than by choices made under pressure. While her internal state is described with vivid imagery ("phosphorescent with doubt"), she remains a passive observer of the ritual and the election, lacking a dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses that drive the outcome. Her transformation at the end feels externally bestowed by the Thunder-bearer's validation rather than earned through active agency.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but Elara’s sudden competence shift from sketch artist to expert locksmith—using hairpins and charcoal dust—strains credibility despite the mnemonic explanation. The interiority relies on melodramatic abstraction ("buried her alive," "sacred hush") rather than grounded, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.7)
    Character agency is largely outsourced to the biological trait; the leaves, rather than Aurelia's intuition or social skill, solve the central interaction with Marcus. This robs the protagonist of a difficult choice or persuasive struggle, making the resolution feel mechanical rather than earned. Marcus serves as a functional roadblock who capitulates instantly, preventing genuine status dynamics or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her competence is absolute, leaving little room for internal struggle or contradictory impulses. The trait "seasonally mute" feels somewhat redundant or confusingly integrated in a world that has already "transcended speech," reducing the potential for character-specific constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael-9 is a distinct focalizer with a clear internal conflict (nostalgia vs. survival) and a strong backstory woven into the crisis. The emotional arc is legible, though the internal state is often described via abstract labels ("childhood fears," "terror of early existence") rather than dramatized through distinct micro-choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya functions primarily as a thematic delivery system rather than a character with embodied agency. Her motivation is explicitly labeled ("to prove that listening heals") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. She faces no significant internal obstacles, and her role in the climax is passive observation followed by a symbolic handover.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with embodied conflict; her motivation ("to encrypt vulnerability") is abstractly stated rather than viscerally felt. She faces the task with competent stoicism, lacking the internal contradiction or struggle required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation relies on "inexplicable certainty" rather than a dramatized need or struggle, making her descent feel procedural rather than urgent. She lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a linear execution of tasks without hesitation or significant emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist displays high competence but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is procedural rather than psychological. While her isolation is stated as a "chosen armor," the emotional cost of this stance is not dramatized in the scene, leaving her functioning more as a magical technician than a fully realized character. The "tranquil blaze" suggests an emotional paradox, but she never wavers or faces a choice that challenges her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya accepts the ghost's nature instantly without skepticism or visceral reaction, making her emotional grounding feel thin. The relationship with Elias develops entirely in summary ("weekly tea sessions"), denying the reader the scene work where status dynamics or genuine connection would be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the "skeptic" persona feels like a label that contradicts the competence shown in performing high magic; the trait doesn't meaningfully impede the action. Internal interiority is diagnostic ("realizing that love had been a quarantine"), summarizing emotion rather than embodying it. The shift in perspective at the end is functional but intellectually stated rather than earned through visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear, and the physical cost of the blood-ink ritual grounds her commitment in the scene. However, she functions more as an archetype fulfilling a prompt than a nuanced character; her path is devoid of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses, making the outcome feel predetermined rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's primary trait is established via the diagnostic label "richly perceptive" rather than dramatized observation. Her motivation regarding her sister is clear, but the emotional reality is often summarized ("perception ached") rather than embodied in interaction until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara displays absolute competence without internal contradiction or struggle, which flattens the dramatic tension. The ghost functions primarily as a plot dispenser who capitulates instantly, failing to apply genuine pressure to her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kaelen is a static vessel for wisdom rather than a character under pressure; she begins and ends in the same state of serene competence. There is no internal contradiction or difficult choice in the scene, only the routine execution of a task she is already an expert at.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization is functional but relies on summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure; Mara's "trembling hands" are a stock cue rather than embodied emotion. Her interaction with the settlers is narrated from a distance ("Mara stood her ground... She explained"), preventing any deep exploration of her internal conflict or social stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian is a vividly realized archetype with a motivation that creates immediate, distinct interiority ("locksmith of realities"). The specific physical detail of the mushroom beard grounds his "gritty whimsy" persona, and his choice to complicate rather than stop the prophet is a nuanced expression of the "variant allegiance" trait.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, sympathetic protagonist with a clear motivation (reconnecting with his daughter). However, the blend of "vagrant poet" and "sound wizard" feels slightly disjointed; the magical competence is convenient and dampens the struggle of his vagrancy. The internal arc is solid, moving from preservation to action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s primary trait ("logically emotional") is established via direct exposition ("She was logically emotional by nature") rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. The internal struggle between her mathematical training and emotional intuition is summarized as a completed understanding rather than played out as a volatile, active tension during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is competent and her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal conflict in the present moment; her struggle with impatience is relegated to backstory. She functions more as a thematic vehicle than a flawed individual making difficult on-page choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s internal conflict between the mentor’s training and her intuition is legible and drives the scene, fulfilling the requirement for contradictory impulses. However, the backstory of the "controlling influence" is summarized rather than dramatized, and the shift from suppression to liberation relies heavily on exposition ("entangled memories she had spent years trying to compartmentalize") rather than purely embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but his internal arc relies heavily on stated feelings ("offering last rites to souls he secretly doubted") rather than dramatized struggle. The pivotal realization is delivered to him by external circumstance (the repairman and the light) rather than earned through his own agency or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kip is a focused protagonist whose "steady curiosity" drives the eons-long task, though the "pioneering" label feels slightly nominal given the isolation. The dedication is well-dramatized through action, and the final laugh provides a distinct, embodied emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara displays high agency but lacks internal conflict or genuine vulnerability; she moves through the plot efficiently without facing a difficult dilemma or paying a personal price. The "brightly attentive" attribute is applied as a static label rather than a trait that complicates her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions as a competent problem-solver rather than a character under pressure; her "calm intuition" dissolves the central dilemma without internal friction or doubt. The lack of a personal flaw or genuine struggle turns the crisis into a procedural task, reducing emotional resonance. The "shadows" offer aesthetic texture but do not complicate her choices or exact a price for her power.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—seeking the "frequency of finality" before her own appointment—creates a compelling, high-stakes internal crucible. The shift from rigid desperation to "holding loosely" is earned through the tactile, specific action of trawling, resulting in a resonant internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena’s internal arc is intellectualized rather than felt; the epiphany relies on abstract summary ("intersubjective understanding") rather than embodied contradictory impulses. The resolution feels clinically precise, lacking the messy texture of genuine heartbreak or the struggle required for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions as a competent procedural vessel for the ritual but lacks deep interiority or distinct personality beyond the immediate task. The attribute "strangely honest" operates as an asserted label rather than a trait demonstrated through high-stakes choices or vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a magical archetype rather than a realized character, lacking internal contradiction or struggle. She faces no meaningful micro-choices; her interaction with the town is frictionless, and her internal state is described via summary rather than dramatized reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is defined largely by labels ("reticent scholar") and internal summary rather than dynamic choices under pressure. While her final action is motivated, the journey there relies on told realizations ("She understood now") rather than dramatized struggle or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a singular, tragic figure whose motivation—to capture the uncapturable—is perfectly fused with his fatal flaw. The internal conflict is visceral, dramatized through the physical sensations of "rust and silver oxide" and the desperate act of writing. His resignation to the cycle at the end feels earned and distinct to his character.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich and consistent with the lyrical tone, successfully blending professional competence with metaphysical longing. However, she functions more as an archetype than a fully realized individual; her "sage" nature feels asserted by the narrator rather than demonstrated through complex choice, and her acceptance of the end lacks visceral human resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character agency is weak, particularly for Maya, who functions more as a prop for Elena's intervention than an autonomous agent. Her transition from wielding the record as a "weapon" to surrender is precipitated by the arrival of a scent rather than internal processing or relational pressure. The protagonist, Elena, acts with functional efficiency but lacks internal conflict or personal cost; her "flawless goodbye" feels like a professional service rather than a human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's obsession is well-established, and her transition from apprentice to master provides a solid backstory. However, her mastery is asserted rather than tested through difficult on-page choices; the resolution feels like the execution of a known plan rather than a struggle against doubt or limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's pivot from skeptic to healer is compelling, grounded in the specific action of bone setting. However, the dialogue "I am a forgiving skeptic... I forgive us both" is overly diagnostic and self-aware for the moment, reading more like a thesis statement than natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is a distinct presence with a clear, mythic motivation, but her internal struggle is largely summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the moment. The conflict between her "hunger for flame" and her new discipline is stated but resolved too smoothly ("she did not pause"), lacking the friction of a tempting alternative or a near-failure that would prove her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich and consistent, effectively contrasting digital noise with organic decay. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic "therapy-speak" (e.g., "protection did not require hardness," "graft new meaning onto old wounds") rather than purely embodied emotion, which distances the reader slightly from the raw grief.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara functions effectively as a mythic archetype, but her interiority feels somewhat distant and static. The "conflict" is resolved via ritual rather than a pressurized on-page struggle between live options, making the emotional cost read as told rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a conflicted character; she faces no internal opposition or doubts. Her actions are procedural steps in a ritual rather than costly choices under pressure, resulting in a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with a cohesive worldview, but her motivation ("singular, consuming") precludes internal conflict or doubt. Her emotions are often labeled ("grief," "joy") rather than dramatized through behavior, and the physical cost of the ritual is stated as a transaction rather than felt as an embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias is a functional, competent archetype who lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. His motivation is stated as a mantra rather than dramatized through difficult choices, resulting in a static protagonist who executes a task without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the ritual rather than an agent making hard choices; her motivation is a preset directive without internal conflict or potential for failure in this specific window. The characterization relies on abstract descriptors of state rather than dramatized reactions to specific, difficult burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s internal state is consistent and coherent, but the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("presence was a posture," "grief... required containment") rather than embodied experience. This "therapy-speak" creates a layer of distance, analyzing her emotions for the reader rather than allowing them to emerge through the carving action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation is sharp and drives the central negotiation, creating a clear arc from scavenging to surrender. While her internal state is conceptually rich, it relies heavily on metaphorical summary ("sediment," "layers of compromise") rather than embodied reaction until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya functions as a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful blind spots. Her motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") rather than visceral, and she faces no moment where her competence fails her, resulting in a protagonist who solves rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her emotional state is conveyed through diagnostic labels ("broken ambition," "ghost tempo") and summary rather than dramatized micro-choices. The internal conflict feels pre-digested, with the realization at the end explained via exposition ("Elara understood then") rather than earned through a struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara is a coherent focalizer with a clear shift in motivation, but her interiority relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized, embodied emotion. The "errant legend seeker" identity feels more like a label than a lived behavior in the scene, and her reactions are intellectualized ("serene upheaval") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a consistent, functional protagonist who executes his task with competence, but he lacks internal contradiction or struggle. While the trait "infinitely patient" is enacted, his success feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult choice or significant personal cost beyond physical stiffness. He operates more as a vehicle for the concept than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's profession is distinct and shapes his worldview, but his interiority relies on diagnostic summaries ("needed to understand") rather than strictly embodied emotion. The shift from grief to acceptance is logical but feels slightly curated rather than viscerally suffered.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prince Elian functions as an archetype whose interiority relies on repetitive list-making ("hypothesizing about everything") rather than specific, contradictory emotions. His reactions (weeping, falling to knees) lean toward melodrama and performance rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The backstory of the arsonist's daughter fighting her lineage is compelling, but the character's interiority is often summarized through dense metaphors rather than dramatized via micro-choices. Maya feels more like a vessel for the prose than a living agent; her emotional state is declared ("unyielding compassion") rather than demonstrated through struggle or contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by prompt labels ("luminous skeptic") rather than dramatized behavior; her skepticism is immediately contradicted by her unquestioning acceptance of the magical mechanics. There is no internal conflict or moment where her specific traits force a difficult choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara serves as a clear vessel for the premise, and her motivation ("share light without using fire") drives the plot. However, she lacks internal conflict; her "crystalline" certainty makes success feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The final cost of dispersal is paid, but the decision process is frictionless and lacks an on-page moment of hesitation or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is idealized and lacks internal friction; his emotional state is described through poetic abstraction ("dimensions of marble") rather than grounded psychological texture. The "fiercely meditative" trait feels like a declared label rather than a source of genuine struggle or trade-off. The mentorship is gentle and supportive, lacking the resistance or status dynamics that create a true crucible for character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, internally consistent focalizer whose guilt and precision color the narrative effectively. However, the story relies on a static internal state—maintenance of a penance paid decades ago—rather than a new, active choice with visible cost in the present scene. The "cost" is historical; he executes the adjustment with the "precision of a surgeon" rather than struggling against a live counter-force that challenges his diligence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mara is a passive vessel for the plot; her "blithe" nature is a stated attribute that contradicts the setting without generating productive tension or subtext. Her motivation is expository ("needed to untangle") rather than felt, and the epiphany is unearned by struggle or sacrifice. The emotional realization is instantaneous and convenient, lacking the friction of genuine character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and the interior landscape is dense, but the characterization relies heavily on summary (e.g., "she was groundedly imaginative") rather than dramatized choice. Elara is portrayed as perfectly competent, lacking the flaws or struggle under pressure that would create a genuine crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions as a dedicated vessel for the premise rather than a conflicted protagonist; his motivation is single-minded and benevolent without internal opposition. The attribute "secretly luminous" operates as a declared superpower rather than a dramatized trait, and his choices lack the hesitation or contradictory impulses that create depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a distinct, compelling focalizer whose internal landscape of grief is rendered with specific, embodied detail. His contradictory motivation—to preserve his mother by destroying the vessel of her memory—creates genuine psychological pressure. The emotional progression feels earned, moving from denial to a somber acceptance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias is a distinct, contradictory figure whose self-aware "wannabe" pretension effectively balances his genuine philosophical insight. His internal conflict—serving ego versus civilization—is dramatized clearly in the moment of choice, and his "abrasive calm" reads as a believable coping mechanism rather than just a trait label.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization relies on archetypes (the wise mentor, the enemy students) rather than specific, lived interiority. While the miner's daughter has a moment of "trembling," the emotions are largely conveyed through labeled abstractions ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") rather than embodied reaction, making the reconciliation feel schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is vivid in concept (tasting memories) but resolves through summarized "meditative will" rather than dramatized cost. The emotional arc feels processed and tidy ("deliberately released it"), lacking the messy resistance of genuine trauma. The "informally wise" attribute is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The resolution feels like a soft reset without a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer, but his condition ("involuntarily truthful") acts as a plot device that bypasses the struggle of a difficult choice, reducing his agency. The engineer functions largely as a passive audience for his monologue, lacking the resistance or friction needed to spark genuine relational dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya is a competent observer but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her journey is frictionless; she wants to understand and succeeds immediately without personal cost or difficult choices. The label "creeping normality noticer" tells rather than shows her psychological makeup through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Corvin is a compelling, distinct focalizer whose internal state matches his physical nature ("calcified fingers," "granite heart"). His struggle is internalized but lucid, though the epiphany regarding his motivation feels slightly lectured rather than earned through a harder on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal struggle is vivid, with the "grim optimist" trait actively shaping her resilience against the environment. Her motivation is visceral—not just escape, but the specific retrieval of a missed chance—anchoring the surrealism in human regret. The shift from physical climbing to intellectual rebellion feels earned by her psychological exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maya possesses clear interiority and a distinct perspective, but her agency is limited to maintaining a vigil rather than making difficult choices under pressure. She functions more as a vessel for the concept than a protagonist navigating conflict; the "cost" of insomnia is stated as a gift rather than a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is a competent focalizer with a clear professional lens ("historically oriented") that colors her narration. The internal shift from dismissing the bread as superstition to recognizing it as an archive is a solid beat, though the moment of realization feels slightly more convenient than earned by character struggle. Her "cultured diction" is a strong voice marker, though her emotional interiority is somewhat distanced by the elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and drives the narrative, but her internal landscape feels somewhat functional, serving the high-concept plot rather than revealing deep character contradiction. While the "terror of having no future" is stated, the emotional cost of erasing her own existence is intellectualized rather than deeply felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s characterization is elevated by the dark specificity of her confession; moving from a victim of haunting to the architect of her mother’s death adds necessary moral weight. The internal conflict is tangible, though the advisor figure functions more as a prompt-delivery system than a fully realized antagonist, slightly simplifying the external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions as a competent archetype rather than a vulnerable individual; her mastery is absolute, leaving no room for internal conflict or doubt. While her motivation is stated, it lacks an emotional counterweight or cost, making her feel more like a magic system delivery device than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's obsession effectively drives the narrative; her choice to play the final sequence is a clearly motivated escalation that shatters the status quo. The "quietly driven" trait is explicitly labeled in exposition, which slightly distances the reader, but her actions (three years of solitary mapping) successfully dramatize the quality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena's interiority is rich but relies on summary ("Elena understood") rather than dramatized struggle to convey her shift from exposure to contextualization. The repeated diagnostic label ("emotionally rational") distances the reader from her actual emotional state, making her final choice feel intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characterization relies on direct labeling ("stoically sensitive," "professional stoicism") rather than dramatized traits. Motivation is stated in abstract terms ("archaeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than shown through a specific, conflicted desire under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on role labels and forced prompt phrases ("tranquilly perceptive") rather than embodied behavior. The protagonist's internal shift is instantaneous upon finding a manual, lacking the struggle or ambivalence required to make the "logical" deduction feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation, but her internal journey lacks friction; she executes a known ritual without doubt or contradictory impulses. The absence of difficult micro-choices under pressure makes her feel more like a vessel for the concept than a character in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Amara is a compelling protagonist driven by a specific, grief-fueled obsession that feels earned and urgent. Her internal landscape is vivid, though the emotion is occasionally labeled ("bleak exhilaration") rather than fully dramatized through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but his internal landscape is static. The "perpetually surprised" trait acts as a physical label rather than a psychological constraint that shapes choices. His motivation is stated clearly, but the resolution comes through procedural competence rather than a character-defining sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer with a specific, original backstory that grounds his present guilt and motivates the scene. The internal conflict is palpable, leading to a credible shift in stance, though the interior label "sieved hush" feels like a forced insertion rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist is drawn with competence and specific internal texture, grounded in the "recycling" worldview. However, the trait "uncommonly thoughtful" relies on a somewhat standard trope (counting thunder) rather than a fresh psychological contradiction, and the secondary characters function primarily as props for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is legible and the internal conflict between hubris and humility is well-staged. However, the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("merrily melancholic," "backlash of regrets") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The prompt-mandated attributes feel inserted as descriptors rather than organically driving behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist’s internal state contradicts the premise: she supposedly lacks the capacity to feel, yet experiences &quot;hollow ache,&quot; &quot;hunger,&quot; and &quot;accumulated guilt&quot; before the cure. The emotional arc is resolved by external magic (the lake) rather than a character-driven epiphany or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative clearly from the start. The internal conflict between the fear of losing herself and the desire for connection is articulated, though the resolution comes slightly too easily through the sister's reassurance. The character's agency is high, as she actively initiates the transformation and accepts the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's internal conflict—resentment of lost time versus maternal love—is dramatized with visceral precision, avoiding easy sentimentality. The shift from a desire for reclamation to "sanctification" feels earned through the ritual's physical and emotional cost. Her contradictory impulses drive the scene, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living character; his internal struggle is summarized as backstory ("spent decades") rather than dramatized as an on-page dilemma. He executes the plan without hesitation or contradictory impulses, resulting in a static emotional arc despite the high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page, acting as a passive vessel for the theme rather than an agent making difficult choices. His motivation is abstract and philosophical ("understand the texture of transformation"), which distances the reader from any embodied struggle or emotional cost until the final surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is hyper-competent but static; she faces no internal contradictions, doubts, or genuine struggles during the scene. Her execution is flawless, which flattens the dramatic stakes and prevents the reader from seeing her make difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is functionally competent but lacks internal contradiction; his march toward self-sacrifice feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, missing a dramatized micro-choice or moment of hesitation that would make the emotional cost visceral rather than just transactional.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation to break silence is clear, but the protagonist's internal state is described through poetic labels ("furiously tranquil") rather than dramatized psychological struggle. Her resolve is absolute from the start, leaving little room for conflicting impulses or doubt to drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The characters function as stylized archetypes for the philosophical premise but lack deep interiority or contradictory impulses. Aldric's backstory ("philosophical disagreement") is clever but keeps the emotional stakes abstract, and the "truce" feels structurally inevitable rather than earned through genuine character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's condition (molting personalities) creates a compelling internal constraint and tragic cost (memory loss) that anchors the narrative. However, the "penny poet" persona functions more as a stated label than a lived reality; his perceptions and internal voice do not consistently reflect the specific texture of a poet beyond general romanticism.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motivation to survive through art is compelling, and her competence is well-established without feeling unearned. However, the narrative relies on diagnostic labels like "steely longing" and "strategically creative" to define her internal state, telling the reader her emotions rather than fully embodying them in reaction and sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s internal state is clearly rendered, but her motivation is stated ("burned clear") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The central internal conflict—doubt—is resolved by external permission (the grandmother's apparition) rather than a costly personal choice, making the arc feel slightly procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara functions more as a vessel for the story's metaphors than a contradictory agent making hard choices under pressure. Her interiority is abstract ("excavation from deep silt") rather than embodied, and her pivotal decision to prune the tree is dictated by the magical lace instructions rather than an earned internal struggle, reducing the cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's voluntary chaining and non-violent blockade reveal contradictory impulses (patience vs. force) acting in the climax, earning her descent with the felt cost of the chain's limit. Interiority embodied in trembling fingers and worn concrete circle. Flawlessly individual without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—rejoicing in stripped-away drama yet mourning the butterfly—pulses in every micro-choice (kneeling, breathing slower, shelving pulsar papers). The final renunciation of “needless drama” costs her the language that once defined her; the neural rewiring is visible, earned. Minor slip: “she preprocesses reality” re-stated rather than embodied mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictions are dramatized in the frost-guided walk: the compulsion to “retrace” versus the vow to “pause.” Interiority stays concrete—glass-maker’s eye for lattice, kiln-house smell—never slipping into label-speak. The ledger’s shift from debt to devotion is earned by the cave discovery, and her decision to carry it east crystallizes an Earned Stasis with visible cost: she forfeits the old blaze-of-glass identity. The only restraint from 9+ is that the suicide attempt is summarized, not enacted, so the flaw impetus is told, not felt in body.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief for the lost auditory world and fierce refusal to surrender music—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (striking forks, controlling breath). The final Earned Stasis, her recognition of herself in the winterglass, is fully prepared by the escalating thermal palette and costs her the last illusion of ever “hearing” again. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the brother’s off-stage presence keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marian’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is dramatized through her three-day resistance to the summons; the embodied toll (lens pulsing behind her eyes, distress signals in her sternum) makes her refusal and eventual ascent legible. Her interior contradiction—duty to soil-bound death vs. need to deliver displaced souls—drives every beat; the choice to cradle the jagged glass and step into impossible water crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: the lens crumbles to sand and she trades her guild’s terrestrial craft for a new, unending post as librarian of the drowned. Stubbornness forecloses retreat; the ending stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—secrecy vs. the need to pass the torch—peaks when the child accosts her; the renunciation of anonymity is earned because every prior run dramatized the cost of exposure. Micro-choices (no torch, exact placement of insulin) reveal a hierarchy that prizes collective survival over personal credit. The only bar to 9+ is that her flaw/struggle is stated more than embodied in visceral beats.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—documentarian vs. participant—drives every beat; the 1847 nurse memory is embodied through trembling lungs and the camera drop, not label. The final collapse carries visible cost (loss of observer distance) earned by the prior breath-sync ritual. Micro-choices (aperture tweak, crystal press) reveal value hierarchy without exposition. Only the “spiritually curious” tag drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, trimming the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—designer’s mastery vs surrender to the maze—are fused in every beat; the final disintegration is the inevitable cost of his need to “map” time by becoming it. No stock phrasing; interiority is botanically exact (“cambium layer,” “mycorrhizal networks”). The renunciation is earned: each hyperbolic step enlarges the trap he then embraces. Micro-choices (touching the halo, stepping deeper) visibly foreclose escape.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s seventeen-year voluntary imprisonment is dramatized through the worn circle in the concrete and the chain’s weight, not told; her refusal to fight is a lived contradiction that costs her on the page. The micro-choice to block the stairs with her body, not violence, crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses escape for herself. The scavenger’s mirrored hesitation shows status shift without speech. Interiority stays concrete—voice never drifts into label-speak even at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—healer turned betrayer—presses every micro-choice; the synesthetic ache, marrow clock, and final self-fitting of the device all body her guilt. Motivation stays singular and intensifies, culminating in the earned stasis of bearing witness rather than repair. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets correctly inert.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “quietly savvy” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (slipping the case, reading jasmine) and embodied tension (“heart pressing against her ribs”), but the final beat—pressing ear to leather to “hear destiny knock”—edges toward epiphanic shorthand rather than a contradictory impulse still in play; the illuminated-moment obsession remains motive, not yet a visible flaw that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glassblower’s solitary ceremony is vivid and consistent: her dramatic self-narration externalizes loneliness without lapsing into explanatory labels. Interiority stays concrete—thumb tracing the bookmark, lungs filling with “oxygen-rich air”—and her renunciation (leaving the spheres, walking into twilight) carries visible cost. Yet the contradiction between “abandoning the world below” and crafting shelters for future scientists is asserted more than dramatized, keeping the internal conflict just shy of full pressure. The final micro-choice is earned, but the emotional stakes plateau rather than compound.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fear as adaptive tool is dramatized through tremor-legible decoding and railing-calculated evasion; every beat weaponizes the phobia rather than merely labeling it. Micro-choice chain—kneeling despite acrophobia, tracing cast while shaking, stepping aside to wobble rail—earns the final autonomy. Interiority stays embodied (“stars above seem like a crushing weight”) and avoids diagnostic talk. Cost is visible: the wobble forces father to cling in vertigo, mirroring Kai’s daily ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    The oracle’s interiority is vivid—her cataloging reflex, her barefoot pacing, the booklet flaking onto her skin—but she never makes a micro-choice that risks anything; the “final coordinate” is only noted, not enacted, so the renunciation feels reported rather than paid for. Still, her perceptual signature is singular and consistent, carrying the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lyrical rather than embodied; “remarkably composed” is asserted not enacted, so the memory-wipe aftermath never feels risky. The violin-first touch triggers the loop, but Seven’s emotional stakes stay abstract until the final paragraph, muting cost. Still, the quiet endurance registers as a credible renunciation once the bow freezes.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt, loyalty, investigative hunger—are dramatized in continuous micro-gestures (tracing the groove, pocketing the lens). The final choice to confess is prepared by the embodied weight of the tickets and the shared silence with Julian; cost is felt in the cracked-foundation image she keeps. Interiority is concrete, but “transparency” is named a little too overtly, blunting full nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—lying to the garden, then atoning—are dramatized in concrete beats; the final renunciation (empty pouch) carries visible cost. Interiority is vivid and particular, though a trace of diagnostic self-labeling (“wisely pragmatic”) nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s obliging diligence and quiet defiance of Dr. Vex’s ridicule give him a believable interior contradiction; the moment he pulls the lever crystallizes his hierarchy of values, trading safety for vindication. Embodied emotion is strong (“icy warmth spread through his chest”). No secondary character on-page long enough to test relationship crucible, but single-POV interiority is rich and specific. The final micro-choice is earned and irreversible, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—archivist’s precision vs. dream-driven audacity—drives every micro-choice; her bow stroke is an embodied wager that forecloses sterile documentation. The antique program’s growing dampness in her grip is a tactile cost that scales to the ghost-collaboration. Passivity is impossible: each pulse of water and light demands she improvise under mortal risk. The final renunciation—letting the dissolved program drift away—reads as earned relinquishment of archival safety for artistic consummation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—professional fault-tolerance versus personal complicity—is dramatized in the moment she tapes the mutant edelweiss front-and-center; the trembling hand, smudged ink, and luminous sorrow embody cost without therapy-speak. Fever-aftermath weakness and residual perceptual smear keep her competence credibly limited. The swallowed-truth motivation drives every beat; no stock labels intrude. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: hide anomaly → confront anomaly, with professional identity visibly forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her flashlight trembles, her fingers trace cold metal and glass—but she never breaks past observer to agent; the micro-choice is only to photograph. The sixteen colors = sixteen souls realization is powerful yet delivered as summary, not as a decision that costs her a path. Earned Stasis is hinted (she “carries no belief” yet bears witness) but the refusal isn’t dramatized with visible price on the page. Still, her skeptical exhaustion and the weight settling “into her sternum” keep her credibly flawed and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—“gripping reality loosely” is lived through synesthetic perception rather than label. Yet no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the keeper only observes, never chooses under pressure, so the arc is static. Earned stasis is signaled (“gripping the moment loosely”) but cost is atmospheric, not dramatized on her body or future options.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is dramatized through micro-choices—breath-matching guitar, waiting silence, opening the locket—each action quietly risking rejection. The boy’s first whistle note and word carry believable hesitation and cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; contradiction appears in her hope-versus-restraint tension. Only the grandmother locket backstory is slightly over-reflected without fresh choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction is legible—she weeps while archiving, feeling the wall’s mnemonic shudder—yet the micro-choice that would foreclose a path (speak the next story aloud vs. seal the case) is only gestured at, not dramatized with visible cost. The perceptual trait is embodied through concrete wall-touch and dye-stained fingers, but the ending renunciation remains implicit rather than irrevocable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to escape yet believing his prophecies are accidental—surface only in reflective summary, never in a single pressured beat where he must choose. The final “escape” is declared, not dramatized; we never see him pack, hesitate, or surrender the lighthouse keys, so the cost feels abstract. Interiority is evocative (“shift in his bones like a key change”) but repeats the same musical metaphor rather than deepening. Still, the blind-spot that drives the plot is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s calm, rhetorical precision under apocalyptic pressure is vividly voiced; the contradiction between ritual serenity and existential terror is embodied in micro-choices (depressing pedal, gray line, final loop). Interiority stays concrete, never abstract, but the possession stakes never physically hurt him—cost is purely conceptual—so the endurance feels slightly weightless compared to the stakes declared.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—between the triviality of fortune-cookie aphorisms and the cosmic scale of the symphony he now conducts—is embodied in every trembling breath and shell rotation; the final lifted hand is earned by the logarithmic mapping of memory onto ice, making the cost of leaving behind his former life palpable. The only minor drag: “chronological homesickness” is named more than felt in the body early on.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lush—her fear of the tablet, the viscerality of the moss, the tug of centuries—but the text repeats “fractured timelines” instead of dramatizing a single remembered death that could crystallize contradiction. The final self-integration is declared, not demonstrated through a micro-choice that costs her a live option; the tablet dissolves and she simply smiles. Emotion is richly embodied yet never refracted against another will, so pressure stays internal and circular.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s shift from frozen grief to tactile re-engagement is embodied in the drum-skin beat; the causal chain from palm-on-limestone to tear-streaked cheeks is legible and scaled to length. Interiority stays concrete (“gloves made of stone”) and her hierarchy of values—music over safety—activates the climax when she risks touching the needle. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are N/A; Mathew functions as enabler, not crucible. The renunciation of her ear-bound identity carries visible cost in the final image, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s storm-recorder identity is lived-in: the lateral walk, the ink-mixing, the barometric memory. Interiority stays concrete, but the mentor-reveal triggers a near-epiphany (“began to intuit the pattern”) that flirts with diagnostic summary. The final resolve is earned: solitude reframed as greenhouse, cost felt in the rain on her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s obsessive nose-grief is vivid, embodied, and rules every beat; the vial discovery forces a visible micro-choice (kneel, inhale, weep) that alters his emotional stance with on-page cost. Interiority stays concrete—“aromatically cautious,” lungs finally opened—without therapy-speak. The 17-year backstory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the final inhale, meeting BRR. Only minor flaw: the shift from terror to acceptance is slightly compressed, but the tears land as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is dense, embodied, and character-specific; the rope-handling, fossil-scraping, and final seated recitation all spring from the same restless, ethically playful poet. Contradictory impulses—retrieve her voice vs witness geologic time—coexist inside every beat rather than alternating in summary. The renunciation of both doors is credibly foreshadowed by his refusal to tug the rope and by the spiral he lays, so the Earned Stasis feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—"to find beauty in the unfinished"—is concrete, embodied, and drives every micro-choice; the bow’s search for resonant frequencies is a lived hierarchy of values. Interiority stays particular, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation of completion is earned by the causal chain of sounding the shipwrecks. The only bar to 9.0 is that the cost, while felt, is not given a tangible consequence that will alter her next dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s professional thoroughness is shown through ritualistic vial-arrangement and methodical blotter use; the interior contradiction—commerce vs. bridge-building—surfaces only in final admission, never complicating a mid-scene choice. Static-alert cue is bodily, but emotional embodiment stays abstract (“affectionate detachment” is named, not felt). Because the decisive beat (offering the petal) repeats earlier procedure without new micro-choice or visible cost, the turn feels incremental, not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s shift from profit-minded broker to quiet philanthropist is sketched with warmth, but the interior contradiction between “merchant instinct” and “newfound urge” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single, pressured beat; the final ledger-closing is satisfying yet feels lightly earned because no prior micro-choice visibly costs him a concrete opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s solitary ache and the relief of “witness” land with embodied cost; the final dedication is earned. Yet the interior contradiction between “desperate to graft” and bold sympathy is told more than dramatized in mid-beats, and the mute girl’s insertion late dilutes Kael’s agency. Still, the reed-bridge renunciation forecloses loneliness with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s want to document the “acoustic womb” is concrete and stakes rise as she steals ever more time; the interior contradiction between scientific observer and temporal thief is shown, not told. Embodied emotion is thin—pulse at throat is the only bodily trace—so the cost feels more intellectual than visceral. Final renunciation (early wake-up, pendant spent) carries visible price, but because the choice is executed by metaphysical fiat rather than a last instant of agency, it falls short of full Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual (glass eyes pressed to lids, finger-tracing fractures) and his “gently inventive” trait drives every beat; the interior contradiction—yearning for mathematics of closure while surrendering to unquantifiable love—remains active in-scene. The final stance (carrying “the answer in his chest”) is earned: the mosaic’s new drip fissure visibly forecloses the fantasy of solving her absence. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; headcount stays clean. Micro-choices (angle of eyes, pouching them at end) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—wrapping fragments, choosing cache spots—but her interiority drifts toward thematic label-speak (“visibility was not always about being seen”). No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; her motivation is legible and stakes personal, yet the climax is a soft gesture rather than a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—control as blindness—is dramatized in the leaf-unclenching gesture; the 15-year regicide of data is the specific backstory that makes her renunciation cost real. Embodied emotion is precise: “roots cracking through concrete” is felt, not labeled. The final micro-choice—leaving the leaf pinned by wind, not will—earns her Earned Stasis with visible forfeiture of authority.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s insomnia and painter-identity drive every beat: it explains her night vigil, her compulsive sketch at the end, and her willingness to trade months of food for art’s raw material. The contradictory hunger for both stasis (amber) and witness (journals) is dramatized in the physical exchange, not summarized. Only minor erosion: Maren’s function is expositional foil rather than pressure source, keeping relationship-as-crucible light. Still, the final micro-choice—sketching the sinkhole from memory—pays the insomnia/painter thread with visible cost: sleepless clarity weaponized into record.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clairvoyant blind to the pilgrim—grounds every beat; her micro-choice to witness rather than foresee costs her certainty and earns the ending’s earned stasis. The pilgrim’s flattening into a vessel keeps the relationship crucible from fully igniting, a hairline slip that bars 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—visionary flashes trigger concrete micro-choices (handing over the valve). Yet the “ocean-spray archivist” label never shapes on-page tactics; he behaves like a generic empathic gatherer. Cost is felt when the valve passes to the widow, but Kael’s own stakes remain static; no path is foreclosed for him. The contradiction between exile trauma and calm cataloguing is stated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s “trembling certainty” is an evocative contradiction, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“all cartography is storytelling”) that tell us her lens rather than dramatize it. The sister-ticket motive is vivid, yet the leap from cracked concrete to cosmic faith feels declared, not earned by micro-choices on the page. No interior contradiction actively complicates the final punch; she moves forward with single-track resolve, so the cost reads symbolic rather than personal. Still, her perceptual signature—mapping, gradients, negative space—gives her a distinct cognitive gait that keeps the score solidly mid-high.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s shift from detached cataloguer to vulnerable bridge-builder is credibly anchored in her tactile discovery of the tile; the bodily jolt (“burned cold, then warm”) gives the epiphany weight. Her earlier “kindness without ghosts” stance is shown through micro-choices—carrying equipment, calming kids—so the later surrender of skepticism carries visible cost (she forfeits the safety of empirical distance). Interior contradiction is present, but the emotional layering thins in the finale: the beat with the child risks tidy sentiment, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s “boredom heavier than despair” is vivid, but interiority repeatedly abstracts emotion (“mechanical existence,” “forgotten how to feel”) without embodied contradiction. The only micro-choice—stepping into the storm—arrives late and reads pre-decided; no live tension between fear and craving. Loss is stated, not dramatized; the lovers’ parting is three millennia off-stage. Earned smile lands, yet cost feels conceptual rather than personally tasted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s mathematically exact interiority is vivid and consistent; her contradictory need for justice while carrying her father’s con-man ink charges every beat. The final micro-choice—three drops in the judge’s tea— crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Father remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived; Maya’s solo arc earns the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—“fingertips that knew only the weight of vanished things” shows contradiction between preservation and fabrication. His micro-choices (extra leaf where “the present grew thin”) enact a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The final renunciation—closing the notepad on a self-forged continuity—earns its resonance through prior causal texture. No motivational slips; every tactile decision refracts his need to keep human proximity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nameless archivist’s tactile obsession is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (pressing stories to palms, pocketing the poison label) enacts the need to feel erased history. Yet the interior contradiction—whether collecting others’ fragments can ever restore the self—stays summary, never dramatized in a single beat where a collected story actually collides with the protagonist’s own void. The final smile in the dark is credible renunciation, but the causal path is lyric accumulation rather than a tangible fork where one option dies on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s skeptic-turned-wonder arc is legible, but the interior contradiction (“I’m a myth-buster” vs. immediate surrender to magic) is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. The embodied cost—laying down the cello and walking into fog—lands, yet the pivot from empirical editor to mythic participant feels leapt, not earned through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya’s contradictory loyalties are alive in every beat—badge on lapel, tokens under shirt, stone chip scoring paint—so the dual allegiance hurts. Interiority stays concrete: “thrum…through the rusted steel,” “hopeful desperation…like tide water.” The final smile-plus-adjustment shows earned renunciation: she’ll serve the future, not either master, with visible social cost. Still, no second on-page character pressures her, so relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets remain unused, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—reverence versus complicity—is embodied in the shiver she hugs to the heating coils; the photo and rust-message are credible renunciations with visible cost. The “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized, not labeled, driving every micro-choice. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets N/A; solo arc is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s guilt-driven precision is embodied in every tactile motion; the link between repairing the drone and lifting her own guilt is palpable. Blind competence is shown, not told, via the water-basin decoding and steady hands. Internal contradiction—penance versus lingering self-blame—hovers but never crystallizes in a second micro-choice, keeping her shy of the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marlow’s dry editorial precision, skepticism, and quiet reverence braid believably; the dog-eared page pressed to ice is a micro-choice that embodies both tool-use and spiritual concession, earning his thin smile. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the 9+ bar is missed, but the characterization is otherwise clean and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “infinitely patient” trait is dramatized through seventeen years of walking, but interior contradiction is only asserted, never shown in-scene; the final triumph feels pre-ordained rather than paid for by a visible, costly choice. The absence of any second character removes relational pressure, so motivation stays solitary and abstract. Still, the embodied ritual of footfall-tuning keeps her from being a mere emblem.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to air vs. surrendering it—play out in embodied beats; the final exhalation is credibly prepared. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy (sister-memory vs. survival) is legible on the page. One slip: the instant neural rewrite feels reported rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulse—needing to lie to survive yet yearning for the perfect untraceable silence—is dramatized in the embodied beat of gripping the lattice and “convincing the air” he belongs aloft. The final micro-choice—becoming rumor instead of returning—closes his arc with visible cost: exile from identity and place. Interiority remains concrete, never lapsing into diagnostic talk. The only drag is that secondary confessors are named but never differentiated, so status pressure stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eira’s contradictory drives—vengeance and release—play out in embodied beats (the bead’s transfer, the command to plant). Julian’s instant comprehension and acceptance, though emotionally resonant, skips dramatized resistance, muting micro-choice hierarchy and costing full credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient dock-daughter turned outlaw stitcher—drives every move, yet the prose occasionally slips into lyrical self-exposition (“she had grown tired of broken precedents”) that tells the ache rather than showing it in body or tool. Her micro-choices (bleeding onto the plate, the final piercing) are concrete and costly, earning the renunciation of old law, but secondary characters exist only as off-stage elders/voices, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, the flaw-to-stone transfer feels singular and the final seated pause carries earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is lyrically dense yet remains anchored to embodied action—tr fingers the sundial while grief and wonder coexist without therapeutic gloss. Micro-choices (spiral walk, bone-by-bone search, kneel in shadow) externalize the “warmly curious” trait and foreclose the option of leaving the valley unchanged. The final prayer emerges causally from tactile discoveries, so renunciation of exile is earned with visible cost. Flaw: late paragraph emotional summary (“genuine prayer move through her”) drifts toward label-speak, clipping full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for tactile anonymity while racing the encrypted future—grounds every micro-choice. The embodied moment of smudging chalk across the clipboard shows hierarchy of values under time pressure. Final renunciation of the pastel codes costs him a unique tool, earned by prior causal chain. Voice stays consistent: no therapy-speak, only archaeologist-like attention that degrades believably as dawn breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—her public mask of harmless embroiderer versus the covert strategist decoding futures—are dramatized in every piercing of silk; the final “synchronize your men” renunciation is earned by the prior causal chain of stitched warnings and costs her the safety of anonymity, visible in the eternal candle’s reflected glare.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt and need for retroactive witness are viscerally embodied; the unsent letters and moon-healed wounds externalize contradictory impulses. The final kneel-and-speak lands as earned renunciation because every beat has primed the cost of silence. Minor slip: “anticipated grief masquerading as self-protection” flirts with diagnostic label-speak mid-crescendo, blunting peak embodiment a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her “surgical precision” on human pain, the coral-to-cast bridging gesture, the micro-choice to leave the fragment as sentinel. The contradiction between her shrewd innocence and covert decryption is embodied, not declared. The final renunciation—carrying the “smudged lexicon” in her own marrow—pays the cost of translation with earned stasis. Only the sister/elder/soldier handwriting recognition is asserted without on-page differentiation, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s hunger-to-creation arc is embodied in every tactile beat—fingers itch, hands tremble, she kneels, paints air—so the resurrection of joy feels earned. Interior contradiction pulses (“pensive yet genuine” laughter) and the final clasping of the fresco fragment crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses return to numbness. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Voice, gesture, and memory interleave without lapsing into diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thumb rubbing the nickel, her fingers dragging across acoustic foam—but her “methodically playful” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The nested awakenings are beautifully rendered yet arrive as lyric summary; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. Closure is a renunciation (coin left in stone) that feels earned because the text has insistently linked the nickel to her old certainties. Still, the absence of on-page resistance or mistake keeps the arc from full tension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s defiance is vivid—his collar adjustment, seed-click walk, heel-crush sacrifice—but interior contradiction is asserted (“never paid a thought tax”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The renunciation lands with cost (capture, untaxed mind), yet the leap from charming smuggler to martyr feels lightly motivated; we see the stance, not the wrenching choice that locks it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—exile’s ache vs refusal to rejoin either side—surface early and stay active; the moment she presses the postcard to her sternum and curls deeper into the shell crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses escape. Interiority stays concrete, salted with tear-softened edges rather than labels. The final dissolution of her bones into reef-calcium is an earned renunciation whose cost (permanent fusion, lost human form) is visible on the page. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-explanation; grief is tended, not anatomized.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caretaker’s monastic drive—“to preserve the sound of forgotten names”—is embodied in every micro-gesture: the tap of cracked bamboo, the palm against vibrating crystal. Her contradictory ache (poisonous regret swallowed willingly) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation—continuing alone after the tube turns to dust—pays the cost her flaw demands. No other character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; the interior arc alone is sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing silence yet courting risk—stay alive in scene; the embodied “cautious exuberance” and micro-choices (tablet selection, stylus dip) tether motivation to action. The final renunciation of silence is earned by the heptagon ritual and costs her the safety of detachment. Julian’s late entry limits mutual crucible pressure to one beat, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—pension risk vs moral duty—is embodied in every micro-choice (winding the chain, falsifying logs). The 72-hour cipher marathon is told, not dramatized, blunting cost; still, the final bolt-tightening crystallizes a credibly flawed agent who pays with career suicide.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory need for isolation and preservation of song drives every beat; the micro-choice to strap the chip to Orion dramatizes the earned shift from hoarding to release. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers tracing invisible patterns,” “trembling fingers”), avoiding label-speak. The cost—her invented identity dissolving—pays off the backstory in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—thumb on the spiral, knees on oak—but her “featherly determined” trait is asserted, not embodied under pressure; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. She makes one micro-choice (stepping into the maze), yet the causality feels pre-scripted by the father’s codes rather than forged by her own visible cost. The lost-child identity is atmosphere, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s contradictory pulls—scientist vs. seeker—surface in gesture (the feather clench) and the choice to exhale with the ghost, but interiority sometimes drifts into lyric label (“rhythm of belonging”). The final renunciation (letting the ghost go) is earned because their shared breath literally powers the facility, so the cost is visible. Still, her professional lens (“tectonic astrology”) remains asserted rather than shown in micro-decisions, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.7)
    Interiority is lyrically dense but abstract; no embodied contradiction under pressure. “Cheerful gloom” is asserted, not dramatized. Final acceptance is stated rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority—watching shells, aiming the bishop—keeps motive visible; the “lightly attentive” reflex and mechanical breathing show embodied discipline. The ending renunciation (she will never know) lands with conceptual cost, but we get only one micro-choice (wind/release) under pressure; deeper contradiction or risk would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelin’s exile-as-memory-keeper motive is clear and intensifies; her embodied micro-choices (scraping dust, mixing tears, writing on skin) show contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation—turning herself into a living archive—pays off prior causality with visible cost (permanent body inscription, loss of human domain). Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; flaw (isolation) drives the climax. One hairline slip: “spontaneously anchored” is repeated often enough to feel like a tic rather than fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—trembling hands vs. refusal to retire—grounds him; the stone-cast encodes divorce/daughter regret into embodied ritual. Micro-choice (barefoot walk, deliberate toss) reveals hierarchy of values. Final “ready to read cracks” shows earned endurance with visible cost. Could use one more in-scene impulse that risks immediate failure to hit 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—clutching guilt while offering solace—are dramatized in the marble transfer; the “gently skilled” hands both heal and recall failure, a lived contradiction. Elias’s arc from frozen recruit to pocketing the marble is believable because Maya’s testimony externalizes his own shame. Interiority stays concrete: “door handle that had melted in her grip” over abstract labels. Cost is felt: she descends with emptied box, innocence permanently forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “logical dreamer” trait is dramatized through the brass gauge and pattern-building, but interiority stays abstract; no bodily cost or contradiction is shown under pressure, so motivation feels cerebral rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s vocation-driven interiority is vivid, but her decisive moment—tucking the negative away—restates earlier resolve rather than exposing fresh contradiction. The inherited guilt angle is strong yet stays intellectual; no micro-choice visibly costs her a live alternative, so the arc feels foreclosed by theme more than by earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm is palpable and embodied (“grace never wavering” while “borrowed pulse quickens”), but he remains a solitary cipher; no second character pressures him, so status/relationship bullets do not apply. The internal contradiction—still spirit vs racing stolen heart—creates credible tension, yet the choice at the end is more withdrawal than renunciation, so the cost feels lightly worn rather than foreclosed. Still, the specificity of “pigment and shade” vs living rhythm individualizes him above archetype. Enough micro-choices (palm on glass, tracing symbols, faster singing) tether motive to action.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pivot from cold strategist to reluctant planter is dramatized through the soil reveal and her steadying of knees; the scar she once ordered made visible keeps guilt embodied. The child’s sensory reply (“smells like rain”) crystallizes generational transfer without sentimentality. Interiority stays concrete: “weight of collateral damage broke her operatively gentle nature into something deliberate.” Only minor slip—general’s tremor feels reported rather than enacted—keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vane’s contradiction—eco-destroyer who privately mourns—pins every beat: the egg-clutch, the dig, the walk-away. Interiority stays concrete (“feeling its weight like a second heart”), never label-speak. Final refusal to look back crystallizes cost under Accumulative lens. Only micro-slip: no embodied stress signature in the storm departure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lys’s chaste courtesan identity and bodily-poetic agency are concrete: her untouched state is the literal key, her virginity “a blade she whetted,” and every spiral motion while untangling threads is a micro-choice that risks exposure. Interior contradiction shows in the same motion—desire for memory vs. refusal to be broken—embodied in fingertips that “strip away a decade of stillness.” Cost is legible: stepping inside the prism forces her to witness infinite failed selves, a visible psychic price. Only the final beat keeps her just short of 9: the endurance/renunciation lands, but we do not feel the bodily after-shock of carrying the harvested echoes into the thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s shift from manipulator to penitent is credible because every beat roots the change in bodily gesture (handing over the stick, feeding it to flames) and each micro-choice costs him status and certainty. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, the radar dome’s geometry and the stick’s notches externalize guilt. The blind storyteller functions as pressure, not prop: her plain narrative forces Marcus to recognize his reflection, sealing the arc. Flaw retained: we never learn why an urbane calligrapher chose bar-puppet agitprop—motivation springs fully formed—so the arc is emotionally complete but not psychologically exhaustive.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—empirical realism vs. ritual monument-building—plays out in live gesture (knotting, dismantling). Each micro-choice costs her time and breath in thinning air, embodying both refusal and witness; final release of the oldest tower is earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her grief-tinged precision with wax and rope, the “technically gentle” restraint that once cracked a mold—yet the pivotal turn (forgiving herself) is only asserted, not dramatized in-scene; the emotional arc therefore feels pre-completed rather than earned under pressure. Her micro-choices with rope and card anchor the final illumination, but the mentor-mask failure is recalled more than it gnaws, so the cost feels inherited, not freshly paid. Still, the sensory-bronze specificity of her hands keeps her alive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and body-anchored (“wax edges softened by her body heat until the embossed eagle seemed to breathe”). Contradictory impulses surface—“preserve the seal / refuse to dream”—but they are stated rather than enacted in scene; the moment of actual renunciation happens off-stage in dream-logic, so the cost is felt abstractly. Still, the voice-driven self-portrait is singular enough to clear the bar for short-form character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elior’s mingled parsimony and buried wonder are embodied in every beat (oil-drop counting, candle-hoarding, refusal of poetry). The final palm-to-quicksilver choice crystallizes his arc: he spends the faith he never knew he’d saved, visible cost in blood-mercury mix. Interiority stays concrete—“his voice cracking from disuse,” “heart had refused to believe.” Minor slip: the phrase “empirically ironic” is used twice as label, not dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s pacifist scheming is embodied in the tactile gesture of winding the broken pin against the entity’s chest—an inventive, non-violent micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The single-scene crucible keeps interiority concrete, but the entity’s flicker from hatred to dissolution is reported rather than dramatized through corroborating bodily detail, muting the cost felt by Elias himself. Still, the renunciation of force lands as earned because the pin’s return and the sanctuary’s cellular logic have been seeded early, giving the bloodless victory credible lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s artisan’s discipline and dream-chaser hunger are cleanly embodied through tactile glass-work; the “calloused fingers” and “steady hands” ground him. Yet his interior contradiction—pragmatic craftsman vs. visionary hunter—stays implied rather than enacted in a visible micro-choice under pressure. The final smile is credible, but the cost feels conceptual more than visceral; we see no sweat, tremor, or forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s contradictory motives—resentful exile and covert caretaker—collide in every physical act; pruning the trees she once cursed is a lived contradiction. The quartz eyes see fractures she cannot mend in herself, and the final gesture of leaving ribbon and knife together costs her the fantasy of full reconciliation. Interiority stays specific to her profession (“stress fractures in the stone”) rather than diagnostic labels. The only drag is that the daughter remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is implicit, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s paradoxical inheritance and recursive caretaking are vividly interior, but no concrete micro-choice under observable pressure changes her tactics; the final carving is still prospective, so the arc feels stalled at the cusp of decision rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—linguist forced to unlearn language to navigate the mountain—drives every micro-choice; the diary-hand-off renegotiation shows visible cost. The single caveat: the “acceptance over intervention” shift is articulated more than embodied in final beat, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—clinging to singular identity while reaching for plural mythology—are alive in every micro-choice; the final hand-clasp is credibly earned. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, never sliding into label-speak. The only restraint from 9-band: the twin’s absence is so absolute that relationship-as-crucible pressure must be inferred rather than scenically-tested, capping emotional cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is vividly embodied in the tactile braiding scene; her interior contradiction—archivist-as-eraser-of-absence—charges every micro-choice. The final fusion of seal and rope crystallizes a visible cost: her professional identity is permanently rewritten from observer to shaper. No secondary character on page, yet solo arc sustains pressure. One causal leap: thirteen-year wait never shown to corrode or fatigue her, so the emotional price feels slightly under-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—tracing slate plates, reading ice cracks, adjusting her pitch under pressure; embodied emotion (“trapped bees” under her palms) sustains credulity. The final renunciation— maps now useless, immobile vigil—costs her agency and is earned by the prior conjuring beat. No contradictory impulses are shown live, only sequential focus, and the epiphany about “must conjure myself” is declared not dramatized, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s retrocognitive gift is vividly embodied—her “mind catching backward echoes like a net gathering smoke”—and her solitary vigil is credibly obsessive. Yet the final ascent and prism-insertion feel slightly under-motivated: the text asserts “she understood with retrocognitive clarity” rather than letting us watch that clarity crystallize in a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into summary; the beat where she actually presses the prism home is not dramatized, so the cost is more declared than felt. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score into the low-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to preserve yet mourning the loss of private discovery—remains vivid and embodied; the final surrender to becoming the archive is credibly prepared. Micro-choices (kneeling, selecting the quill, writing on skin) track a hierarchy of values, but the absence of any external opposing force keeps the stakes intimate rather than urgent. The arc lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost, yet the lack of a second character or live opposition caps relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—solemn ritual vs. playful caper—are dramatized in the tightening spiral on the tower, body and chant in sync. Interiority remains concrete (“gravity of hopelessness in his knees”), but the siege-despair is abstracted to mercury-pool shorthand, softening cost. The final renunciation—burning the map to reveal territory—earns its beat through prior causal weight, yet the absence of any post-show collapse keeps the price lighter than premium bands demand.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—her tidal-pool gaze, jade-handling, and final micro-choice to entrust the cicada all reveal contradictory impulses (stay/leave, chronicler/lover) without label-speak. The chronicler vocation isn’t occupational filler: it supplies the metaphoric lens that reweights the relationship stakes. Yet the narrator’s motives remain slightly under-embodied; “I don’t need an answer tonight” reads as generous concession rather than visible cost to him. Still, her flaws (margins-obsession, evasion) actively shape the final stalemate, meeting the 9+ quick test for earned, costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and need for sky-silence are palpable; every beat of the trellis walk is a micro-choice against her father’s bunker-world. The porcelain doll as stillness-vessel externalizes the conflict without turning the character into a label. The closing ear-press shows earned, costly endurance: she keeps the hush, but must descend back into steel. Interiority stays concrete—“her lungs expand in ways the bunker never allowed”—never drifting into diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s serene competence is vivid; her micro-choices (rotating vial, trimming gondola) enact the “fluidly logical” trait. Passenger pressure is gentle but legible; the architect’s shoulders drop under catalyzed silence. Motivation remains steady—comfort through silence—without compounding cost beyond her professional pride; deeper interior contradiction would edge this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quietly obsessive precision—“working methodically,” “calculating risks against the weight of history”—is shown through embodied micro-choices (peeling paint strata, palm-flare timing). The renunciation of crowns for knowledge lands as credible, foreclosed path because every beat ties to her archival identity and the ruby flake’s glow provides external confirmation of internal stakes. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly tidy, but the cost of irrevocable stairway loss is felt. Character interiority avoids diagnostic labels and therapy-speak throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s renunciation is embodied in the palm-to-palm transfer and the final letting-go; the mirrored scars externalize the interior split. Mira’s arc from “suffocating” to autonomous breath is shown, not labeled, and the cost of Elias’s self-erasure is visible in the settling doorknocker. Interiority stays concrete (“voltage passing through keloid”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of the metaphor in the penultimate paragraph, blunting the final micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interiority is richly particular—her “virtuously mischievous instinct” is shown, not told, and drives the decisive bolt-to-diamond transformation. The contradiction between savior and scammer is held in scene, not summarized, and the final micro-choice (planting the diamond) costs her the fantasy of escape, foreclosing the path of endless flight. No head-count or relationship pressure on stage, so bullets 6–8 are N/A. Single slip: “shadowseam wonder” is briefly label-speak, but it is immediately enfleshed by the glowing farm, so the diagnostic tinge is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s dynasty-ending mission is clear, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“righteous pursuit” vs. silent complicity) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice; the final act of copying symbols is too safe to feel like a costly renunciation. No embodied emotion undercuts the stakes—heartbeat, breath, sweat are absent even as the room vibrates. The character functions as a mythic archetype, not an individual whose flaws complicate the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Valen’s interiority is richly embodied—his silence calcified into “something beyond mere silence” shows, not tells. The micro-choice to unsnap each clasp, releasing “years of self-imposed separation,” makes the renunciation legible and costly. Yet the mercury visions of unlived lives stay observational; they never force a live fork in his tactics, so the contradiction never activates under pressure. Still, the final surrender is earned by the prior pattern-work, giving a solid 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her “ritual” of reading dust, her refusal to discard files, her pocketing of the button all embody her grief and emergent mission. The contradiction between bureaucratic duty and covert compassion is dramatized in micro-choices rather than told. Final endurance (compiling the mercy index) carries visible cost: she stays after hours, risks her job, accepts the ache. One slip: the instant leap from dust rings to full belief in a sergeant-saint feels slightly under-credentialed for a professional archivist, a hairline motivational bump.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet-archivist trait is shown through ink-stained hands and memorized documents; the stutter is named but never embodied or allowed to complicate action, so the “harmless” label never feels tested. His interiority is vivid (“trembling hands already knew”) yet stays coherent under pressure. The final vanishment is credible because the text has established his habit of invisible preparation. Cost is present—the lagoon seals, allies are lost—but the emotional price is asserted more than dramatized, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s vocation as “morning fog saxophonist” is embodied in gesture and breath; the interior contradiction—using sound to guard silence—shows in micro-choices (fingered rests, inverse frequency matching). Memory of mentor’s dissolution supplies emotional fuel, but the renunciation beat (“he would return tomorrow…”) feels foregone rather than freshly charged; cost is asserted, not re-felt.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, embodied, and consistent with his lifelong vocation; the moment he reorders the miniature monuments into a mandala is a crystallized micro-choice that externalizes his shift from archivist to seed. The final laughter—“moss growing on stone”—is character-specific, earned, and shows transformation with visible cost: he becomes the new seed. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The only drag is a trace of diagnostic self-explanation (“he understood…”) just before the prod; a tighter beat would push this into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction—her lifelong need for certainty colliding with the final leap across the submerged stone—is dramatized in muscular micro-choices (“she allowed the motion rather than resisting it”). The cost of renouncing rigid method is made visible when she pockets the compass and the chronometer sings, vindicating the dead. One hairline slip: “uncertainly certain” is stated twice before it is embodied, a whiff of label-speak that keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief-driven precision and her apprentice’s off-stage fall land emotionally; the interior contradiction between alchemical law and maternal need is vivid. Micro-choices—placing the coin, heating it beyond spec—show a hierarchy of values with regret as currency. The golden seams on Kael’s body externalize her cost, earning a credible renunciation: she accepts an irreversible alteration rather than pure resurrection. Voice remains coherent, though the apprentice’s sole line feels slightly under-weighted against her build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is vivid—trembling hands, bleeding fingers, the crocodile-tooth ritual—but her "modestly fearless" tag never collides with a believable limit; she absorbs pain without resistance or contradiction, so the laugh-catalyst feels pre-ordained rather than earned. No micro-choice visibly risks failure, so the final renunciation carries generalized ache but no personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elena’s hyper-embodied interiority is unwavering; every beat translates pain into spatial coordinates, turning trauma into a navigational instrument. The final “strap’s impression” is a lived scar that quantifies how much light can survive a fracture, earning her renunciation with exact cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation and childhood wound are cleanly fused; the lens-touch that releases “Mara” is a credible micro-choice. Yet her interiority repeats the same abstract cadence (“elusively tangible,” “anchors of intuition”) rather than evolving under pressure, so the emotional escalation feels looped rather than deepened. No contradictory impulse is dramatized inside the eternal instant—she simply succeeds—so the beat carries less cost than the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—pragmatic technician vs. ghost-seer—surface only in the quiet final image; earlier beats remain in observational summary. The embodied cost of her “weightless burden” is felt only in the last two lines, so the arc reads as earned renunciation rather than active struggle. Competence is balanced with genuine patience, but the ringmaster ghost is more symbol than pressure. Still, her perceptual signature is vivid and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s monomaniacal drive to “compress eternity into a moment” is the only motive we ever see, but it is concrete, embodied in ink-stained fingers and frost-logged plates, and it cleanly powers every beat. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, yet her micro-choices (aligning the bottle, pulling the lever, pressing the sheet to the trunk) steadily escalate risk and cost. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where she doubts or weighs loss—but the final exhalation (“Elara finally allowed herself to breathe”) sells a credible, paid-for release. Meets the 9+ quick test on causality, falls short on layered interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s shift from militant to tender custodian is embodied in micro-choices: tracing fissures, refusing to veil mirrors, finally covering them in modesty. The contradiction between his revolutionary past and new “archaeology of forgiveness” is held in scene, not abstract labels. Cost is palpable when he weeps while time streams past the shard—an earned stasis that forecloses further conquest. Interiority stays concrete, though one brief “understood” moment edges toward convenient epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s trembling fingers, 40-year memory, and wordless tinker-song embody a lived craft; the final renunciation—letting the stone dissolve into the comb—pays the exact price his lifetime of truth-keeping demands. Interiority stays concrete (“weathered palm,” bones shaking) and never slips into label-speak. The single contradiction—fear versus duty—drives every micro-choice under rising midnight pressure. Closure cost is visceral: he forfeits the fragment that guided him, forging the tether that buys dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s eccentricity and psychometric gift are cleanly anchored in embodied action (steel-toed boots, vial ritual, palm-reading the compass). The decade-long search is stated, not dramatized, so the final “hinge” feels slightly abstract rather than paid for by visible prior cost. Interior contradiction is present but muted; the beat-to-beat emotional stakes flatten under lavish description. Still, her decision to stay and breathe the impossible rain lands as credible renunciation with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her hands ghosted by carpenters’ shadows shows embodied learning—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation of GPS guidance is earned yet its emotional cost is stated (“she no longer needed”) rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—public vividness vs. private whisper—remains embodied in every beat; the final renunciation of her grief-map is earned because the cathedral glass forces her to re-see the postcards. One micro-choice chain (daily return, brush-stroke overlay, last stroke at melt-water) keeps agency alive. Cost is visible: the mother’s absence stays irreversible, the old palette is literally over-painted. Voice stays particular; no therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scholarly duty vs. bodily possession—is dramatized in knuckles, lungs, trembling fingers; the kneeling micro-choice to arrange debris crystallizes his value hierarchy and costs him temporal sanity. The final renunciation (“not a curse but a communion”) is earned through the drowning sensorium that precedes it. No relationship crucible is required here; single-POV pressure sustains. Minor dip: “solemn weight…settled” is slightly abstract after such visceral embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s solitude, intellectual ferocity, and refusal of nostalgia are dramatized through embodied choices—crunching shells, palms warming the bottle—giving her a sharp, particular interior edge that escalates to the renunciation of false resurrection; the earned cost is legible as the lanterns rise by human friction alone. Interior contradiction and knowledge-bound perception stay clean; no stock labels intrude. Micro-choices reveal a hierarchy that prizes invention over comfort, closing the arc with credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—archivist of others’ vows who swallows their residue—drives every beat; the tongue-dissolve moment crystallizes his shift from observer to medium. Micro-choices (speaking unnamed language, tasting wax) enact the renunciation of scholarly distance with visceral cost. Flaw (compulsive preservation) becomes the very channel that rewrites the city’s stars; no safer path is left. The only drag: “velvet disquiet” is repeated instead of freshly embodied late in text, a faint label-slip under climax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and continuous—her sensory memory of grand-mother, the burn of patience under bark, the spiral staircase decision—yet the “furiously tranquil” trait is declared more than dramatized; we watch composure but not the war inside it. A single contradiction under pressure would push her to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientific duty versus reverence for ancient listening—plays out in her tactile handling of rope vs. switches; the final renunciation costs her institutional role and is earned through seventeen years of calibrated doubt. Micro-choices (testing rope with her own weight, pulling once) embody the hierarchy cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied (“his fingers leaving streaks that caught the starlight,” “yellow lantern glass trembled in his grip”), and every beat of reflection is anchored to a sensory cue. The micro-choice to open the lantern glass like a book and dance the paths refracts his shift from custodian to participant, the cost—his former identity abandoned—visible in the final dawn walk. Spiritual curiosity is shown, not labeled, and his flaw (solitary detachment) is the very instrument of transformation. The only hairline slip: the phrase “he understood now” just before closure is a touch too diagnostic; still, the renunciation is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s muteness, excavator past, and acquiescence to the ghostly transfer are concrete; the “astonished recluse” label is shown via frozen stillness rather than declaration. Interiority stays embodied (“weight that pulled at his ribs”). The final endurance—accepting custodianship of silence—carries visible cost (open box, lifelong vigil). Yet he never actively tests or revises the covenant; the ghosts act, he receives, capping change short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“time felt like rough linen dragged across wet skin”—but her decisions are largely receptive: she approaches, reaches, presses, understands. No contradictory impulse complicates the final surrender; she simply accedes to the urn’s dissolve. The beat-to-beat causality that would dramatize a genuine cost to her hoarded seconds is displaced into poetic paraphrase, so the renunciation feels preordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s quiet tending and final gift to the boy trace a credible arc of “attending to fragments,” but interior contradiction stays lyrical rather than wrenching; the boy’s awe supplies the only external pressure, so the micro-choice to sacrifice the feather lands softly yet visibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, methodical resolve is credibly lived-in; the “brazen calm” never slips into stoic cliché because every beat shows cancer-era bodily limits shaping his meticulous copper work. Interiority stays concrete—“copper against oak with clock-maker precision”—and the final beneath-the-oak acceptance is earned by prior因果: he chooses documentation over self-pity, a visible renunciation. Flaw: no contradictory impulse ever truly contests his serenity; risk of one-note saintliness caps the score just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism clinging to empirical method while chasing a felt metaphysical rupture—drives every beat. The fly amber handled twice, the deliberate trespass, the final refusal to let amber set: each micro-choice escalates from her established trait of “academically rebellious.” Closure cost is visible—“luminous skeptics forever”—a renunciation of institutional certainty that the prior causal chain earns.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coachman’s motive—ritual reclamation of a poisoned shore—remains legible and singular, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“vast patience”) rather than dramatized under pressure; his micro-choices (mixing ash, whispering to pods) are too smooth to reveal hierarchy of values or genuine struggle, so the renunciation at the end feels preordained rather than paid for. Voice and body stay fused in oilskins and iodine, yet the prose never lets physical fatigue or moral doubt complicate the liturgy; the result is a luminous archetype rather than a flawed agent whose limits shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ash’s grief-driven hunt is visceral; the leaf discovery forces a credible, earned collapse of distance into presence. Interiority stays sensory—scent, vibration, taste—never abstract. The final lick crystallizes enduring love as a physical cost. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the relationship crucible from full pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—exile-born despair versus the need to map—remains embodied and active: each charcoal drag resists stretched physics. The compass rose and journal activate stakes across beats; the final smile-through-cracked-lips shows cost. Micro-choices (tearing the applique, pinning it to a sketch) foreclose surrender with visible price, satisfying the 9+ test. Motivation is stable, particular, and drives every beat; only the absence of another character keeps the score just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s thief-with-compassion profile is vivid: the bread-for-orphans/gold-to-widows line crystallizes motive and the escalating chess-swap ritual externalizes it. Interiority leans poetic rather than embodied—no contradictory bodily cues under altitude stress—and the final “keeper of renewed wonder” feels bestowed rather than earned through visible flaw-cost. Still, the coherent moral hierarchy and playful-reverent micro-choices (white-king starlight release, cautious-abandon descent) sustain a believable arc. Capped below 8.8 because the decisive shift relies more on symbolic tableau than on-page renunciation or lingering price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira’s shift from complicit performer to self-immolating truth-teller is rendered through embodied micro-choices (knife hand vs. shielding hand) and a credible internal contradiction—she destroys her own safety to expiate the fakery that enabled catastrophe. The final reading voice that “trembled neither with false drama nor with survivor’s guilt” crystallizes an earned renunciation; the cost is the applause-turned-warning ricocheting from the dome. Benevolent ruthlessness is not merely labeled but dramatized in the clean sever of leather cords while she shields the nurses’ pages—an action that forecloses her protected anonymity. Interiority stays particular to her ex-actor sensorium (“half-false, half-true light”) and drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vey’s contradictory impulses—flee memory vs. transliterate it—are embodied in mercury skin that literally rewrites the mountain; the final choice to keep pain visible is earned through the stone’s tactile translation and the spiral’s contraction. Interiority stays concrete (“swallowing broken crystal,” “quicksilver grief”) and avoids label-speak. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so status/relationship bullets stay unused.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the need to absolve—is dramatized through micro-choices (thread extraction, mirror revelation) that embody his flaw and culminate in credible renunciation. Embodied emotion (“fierce repose,” rain-laugh) stays particular; no therapy-speak. The shift from compulsive mapping to still acceptance is earned by the decoded truth that the prince was lost beforehand, visibly costing him his exile identity. Closure forecloses return to royal service and charges his new pedagogical purpose with residual solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s interiority is lyrically particular (“forged hush,” “prismatic shards”), but the decisive surrender to Lira’s distortion of their art arrives as an articulated epiphany—“True refraction required surrender”—rather than a dramatized, embodied contradiction under threat. The cost is poetic but abstract; we feel the voice merging into bone, yet the prior resistance is mostly summarized. Still, the flaw-motivation link is legible and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—uncertainty vs. the need to gild failure—drives every tactile choice; the final smile is earned because the golden suturing has cost her the last of her master’s ashes and the workshop itself. Micro-choices (pressing nail to crater, releasing gold) reveal hierarchy of values: story over survival. No head-count issues; single-POV stays coherent. Capped at 8.7 because the mentor remains off-page marble; relationship pressure is symbolic rather than interpersonal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s grief and need for absolution are palpably embodied in trembling hands and the cracked-mirror memory; the choice to wade in and leave the shell feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“the weight of absolution”), but a few lines edge toward diagnostic summary (“he understood then that this was why he had come”). Micro-choices track—wrong turn taken instead of retreating—yet the moment of actual commitment (setting the shell down) could carry sharper contradictory impulse to push past 9. Overall a strong, character-particular arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—“screaming tenderness of withheld breath,” “sweating in his narrow bunk”—and his contradictory impulses (obedience vs. insurgent gentleness) act simultaneously. The vial cork choice crystallizes his hierarchy of values; the cost is the risk of Voss’s wrath and the irreversible shift from assistant to keeper of quiet. Micro-choices (climbing the spiral stairs, weeping against the glass) embody the arc. No stock labels; every emotional label is earned through sensorial embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The navigator’s body-as-salvage, arrhythmic heart, and lunar-cognition are vividly embodied; her soldering of the censer foot is a micro-choice that externalizes the internal map. The “geography of loss” motive stays concrete through tactile beats, and the final palm-on-bronze moment crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor over-articulation (“navigate the geography of loss”) flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is saved by the immediate physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s fear-of-exposure versus hunger-for-solitude is embodied in the frantic burial of the eye; the final unshared smile shows a paid-for change. Interiority stays concrete (“her hands moved faster than her tongue”). The occlusion ritual works because her involuntary-truth trait makes shouted fear lethal; cost is legible. Minor slip: “psychological safety” is named more than dramatized after the burial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is richly embodied; the salt-crusted rituals of rope and beacon feel lived-in, and her final acceptance of the stranger’s watch lands as earned renunciation with visible cost—she literally pins the flower to her coat, sealing generational solitude. Contradictory impulses (terror of foreign memory vs hunger for communion) co-exist in-scene, grounding the climax. No diagnostic self-talk; even “displacement of self” is rendered as a visceral blow to lungs. Micro-choices—descending the planks, mirroring the gesture—trace a hierarchy that prizes duty over self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arthur’s solitude and vocation are vividly embodied; the matrix chip as inherited guilt keeps contradictory impulses alive. The final choice—to curate unlived maps—pays off the brother promise with visible cost: he accepts lifelong custodianship inside a flooding cave. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “calcified into routine” is a touch familiar, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's abdication-via-ascent motive is vivid; the swallowed-stone image and her quiet commands to the mountain show embodied rule. Yet the pivot from "answers" to "become cosmic seamstress" arrives in a single exultant paragraph—no prior beat shows her hunger to mend, so the climactic renunciation feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. aching need for recognition—are dramatized in the wrist-tremor and shell-spin beats. The final “We are here” crystallizes her hierarchy of values: presence over proof. Mira’s single whispered line is enough to shift their shared history, but Mira herself remains a functional mirror rather than a full second pressure point. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak intrudes at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—envying his own past certainties while chronicling chaos—drives every beat; the jealous-as-wing epiphany is earned because the scroll has already served as tactile anchor and the stance reversal costs him his last illusion of linear control. Emotion is embodied (trembling fingers, lungs bitten by air) rather than labeled, and the final smile carries the visible price of accepting perpetual recursion. No secondary character appears, so status tests are N/A; the single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s loss of smell is embodied in every beat—she “inhaled deeply, smelling nothing, understanding everything.” The screw acts as an externalized memory organ, forcing her to humanize time instead of scent. Her micro-choice to wrap it in silk before returning it crystallizes the earned shift from aromatherapist to archaeologist of the visible. Interior contradiction is muted; no genuine struggle against her new method is staged, only acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to “transform scars into stories” is concrete and embodied; the crystallization trait forces micro-choices (writing on her own skin, holding breath) that escalate stakes. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—and the final manuscript page is earned. The only drag is a slight over-calibration of competence: she never mis-writes or hesitates once the quill bites, so struggle feels managed rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s double life (gossip columnist / spirit-banisher) is compelling and well-signaled. Her shift from metaphor-armored columnist to raw apology is dramatized in the final kneel; contradictory impulses (reputation vs. remorse) coexist in the moment she breaks the circuit. Cost is visible—her column left unwritten, perfume bottle spent—but the interior contradiction could be embodied earlier; the first outright micro-choice under pressure is the apology line itself. Still, her unique occupation, specific flaw (half-true exposé), and final renunciation satisfy the earned-stasis bar.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.7)
    Witness never acquires interior contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; she drifts through set-pieces summarised as “she understood,” so no earned cost or hierarchy of values is legible. Dictionary-handling is repeated gesture without stakes-based variation; no flaw complicates tactics. Final “she became the library” is asserted, not dramatized, so renunciation carries no visible price. Lacks any on-page beat where wants conflict with fears; thus the required change feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—breath frosting, key burning in palm, fingers finding brass—showing a man literally feeling time. The contradiction between forward “progress” and backward counting is dramatized in-scene, not declared. Final renunciation of the key lands as earned cost: he abandons the only relic of lineage to carry an intangible edge. Micro-choices (grip, stop, release) track a credible hierarchy of values: inheritance < insight.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—protective vigilance versus the ache of proximity—play out in the laser-dot tremble and her refusal to lower it until the instant she chooses transparency. The renunciation of the pointer feels inevitable because every beat has shown her gift turning defensive grid into generous map. Cost is visible: she forfeits the clean binary of intruder/detector and accepts permanent emotional permeability. Interiority stays concrete, fungal-biased, never slides into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory drives—mathematical rigor vs. filial superstition—are embodied in every beat: the trembling hand on the pole, the lantern set down, the deliberate choice to calculate the odds of subway graffiti. The “clover melancholy” moment crystallizes her father’s flaw inside her own body. Closure is earned: she accepts the cost of uncertainty as the candle gutters, foreclosing pure rationalism with visible, felt price. Minor slip: the heart-attack stakes are named more than lived; still, the interior contradiction holds.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mara’s interiority is evocative—"teach endings how to begin"—but she never risks a micro-choice that could fail; every call ends in the same calibrated hang-up, so no visible cost or contradiction sticks to her. The absence of a beat where she nearly keeps a caller flattens pressure and makes her philosophy feel pre-proved rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is evocative but remains at an aesthetic distance; her “gentle thoroughness” is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The sister’s laugh is the only concrete spur, but it never collides with a present-tense contradiction that would force a visible cost. Closure is lyrical renunciation, yet the causal chain between photo-touch and decision to keep writing is implied, not embodied. Character therefore hovers in the 6-band: atmospheric, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—cataloging grief while craving connection—surface in the micro-choice to keep the worthless stone; the child’s reversal forces him to swallow his own medicine and the cost is legible in the laugh that finally breaks desperate humor. Interiority is concrete and flavored (‘desperately jocular lilt’), never diagnostic. One slip: “loneliness is simply love…” is borderline aphorism, not embodied, but it’s immediately tested by the girl’s gift, so the flaw is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lush and body-anchored; the “languages through skin” trait is dramatized in every beat. Micro-choices (kneel, slip ring into pocket) are concrete and signal earned renunciation with visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in her cartographer-flaw—mapping others while dodging her own “here there be dragons”—and the final silence forces her to chart herself. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of self-insight in the closing paragraph that edges toward therapeutic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific; the “confidently uncertain” paradox is lived in every beat. Micro-choices—touching the nib to glass, accepting the pen’s dissolution—embody the stake. The final smile records earned humility without sermon. Flaw: emotional crescendo leans on abstract phrasing (“strange comfort”) twice, softening embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s silent-mapping obsession is embodied in every beat; the camera-click coordinates and sign-language conducting show contradictory impulses (longing vs. acceptance of obscurity) in scene. Milky eyes, trembling hands, and the coat too large make loss visceral. Final renunciation—“the silence will remember”—pays the cost of permanent anonymity, earned by the prior mapping labor. Mara’s whispered warmth supplies relational pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s shift from arsonist to translator of absence is embodied in tactile micro-choices—charcoal from embers pressed into canvas, hair woven with tapestry thread—so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: “volcanic tenderness” is felt on fingertips, not labeled. The only drag is a late echo of “analytically intuitive” that sounds diagnostic rather than lived, but the final tear through soot sells the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s grief-riven obsession is viscerally embodied through the drumming; the quietly rebellious trait motivates every beat. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “stay” plea drifts toward performed emotion rather than contradictory impulse. The earned cost is legible—he forecloses sleep, safety, and perhaps sanity—yet the phantom Elena remains externally observed, limiting interior contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s hushed competence and generational memory ground every beat; the gait-reading trait is lived-in, not asserted. Interiority stays tactile—grease-stained finger, magnetic resistance—yet we never feel a contradicting impulse that would complicate the quiet heroism. The closing renunciation (“Proof isn’t in the speaking…”) costs Kael nothing we can see; the coin passes on but no personal option closes. Still, within lyric-accumulative design, the stoic stance feels coherent, if emotionally flat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s silent witnessing and micro-gesture choreography feel particular—no spoken interiority, yet contradiction pulses between the urge to intervene and the vow of silence. Embodied emotion arrives in the finger-weave and mirror-angle adjustments that cost steadiness and breath. The final lowering of the mirror registers as earned renunciation: the lesson is released into the water, not claimed. The only limit is depth of contradiction visible on-page; the stance holds steady rather than cracking under higher stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s empathic curse is vividly embodied—sediment of swallowed thoughts literally weighs on him—and every micro-choice (sketching angles, cradling the queen) springs from the stated motive to “plant forests of second thoughts.” The final renunciation—leaving the queen on stone—pays the cost in solitude and permanent receptivity, earning credible stasis. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude. The only limit is off-stage presence of townspeople, so relationship crucible and status shifts can’t be tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guarded heart and calloused self-concealment are embodied in tactile beats (hand on barnacles, cable release); the scrimshaw’s hum fuses interior ache to exterior action. One significant slip: “grace that had always been her truest weapon” is diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, −0.4. Otherwise contradictory impulses—safety vs. surrender—co-exist in scene, and the final submersion costs her land-identity irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s “blank face” and performative narration are vivid, but his interior contradiction never sharpens into a decisive, costly choice; the traveler remains a passive mirror, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. The final gift of the bird carries micro-cost, yet the beat is more symbol than felt stake-shift. Still, his hoarded-guilt Auditor past and stagey coping create a specific, memorable psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her breath, the ache in her teeth, the tremor radiating outward—yet the “tremor of certainty” is stated more than dramatized. The final epiphany (the ban was self-built) is foreshadowed but still feels slightly abstract; we see the realization, not the full cost of having mis-built it. Micro-choices (placing palm, stepping between columns) are present and aesthetic, but no contradictory impulse complicates them. Earned stasis is credible; a hairline slip keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—Elara’s yearning to “see” color while already painting beauty in grey—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of that want is earned through causality and costs her best canvas. Marin’s silence and first words feel credibly scarred, not convenient. Only minor slip: “innocently cunning” is named once rather than revealed through fresh action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lyrical and sensorily anchored; the contradiction between obedience to the pilgrimage and her covert diagnostic impulse is active in the moment she lifts the lens. The final decision to stay and keep striking is credible, but the emotional cost is rendered more as image (“golden shadows deepen”) than as felt bodily forfeiture, slightly softening the Earned Stasis punch.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—archiving grief while refusing permanence—drives every micro-choice; the moment she teaches the youth to fold a crane that will guide the next stranger, her renunciation of private grief is earned and costs her solitude. Secondary pressure is light (only the youth), but her calm, ink-stained hands and deliberate falseness of the tattoo stencil embody a hierarchy of values that is never explained, only shown.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to measurement while preaching forward motion—plays out in embodied micro-choices (snap of the tape, brush dip). The renunciation of “back” is earned, but Elias remains a hollow echo rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    Contradictory impulses glow in every beat: she trembles with “anguished joy,” dances violence-and-preservation, laughs-while-weeping.  Micro-choices—elbow-forehead-knee sequence, randomised gait—reveal a values hierarchy (truth > survival) with visible bruises from guardian near-misses.  Final renunciation of straight-line life is earned by the entire chaotic ingress, cost weighted by “atoms of nostalgia” still clinging like ash.  Only keeps her from low-9 band is slight rehearsal of the “perfection = poison” epiphany; interiority flirts with label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—desire to save hope vs. recognition that hope has already mutated into mourning—remains embodied and scene-locked; the micro-choice to re-edit rather than erase proves her hierarchy of values on the page with visible labor-cost. The final renunciation (she does not purge the shadow but tutors it into guardian form) arises from the prior causality of stone loops and is paid for by the night-long archival grind that leaves her “sitting back” in spent stillness. Flaws (obsessive comparison, dusk-vision that exposes her to unbearable twilight) directly shape tactics; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. Voice reads singular, not archetype; her perceptual signature (“softly deliberate”) is shown via tactile control of crystalline vault controls, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle healer who enabled harm—stays embodied in the chameleon’s damaged tail and her own “raw” self-exposure. Micro-choices (removing gloves, pendant) externalize the hierarchy of values with visible cost. The shift from willful blindness to testifying is causally prepared; only the -0.3 for a faint therapy-speak echo (“she too was becoming something honest”) keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—seeking closure yet choosing to keep the wound open—plays out in embodied beats (the pocketed hourglass, the kneel beside his sister). The final micro-choice, touching her frost-filled hand while the glass shatters, crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“unwanted clarity,” “fossilized scar tissue”) flirt with diagnostic shorthand. Still, the arc lands under the Accumulative/Textural lens: enduring the open wound is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking to archive love yet risking her own emotional exposure—remains vivid; the embodied “celluloid teeth” and heat of the strip make her gift tactile. Micro-choices (coiling the film, marking coordinates) enact her hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety. The renunciation—leaving the strip asleep on the platter—costs her immediate possession of the archive, earning credible stasis. Flaws (obsessive mapping of others’ pain) complicate the quest and stay active to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lyrical and body-bound (“clay under her nails and marble dust in her hair”), but the want—freeing creativity—stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page, so the final stillness feels pre-ordained rather than wrested. The micro-choice to lie down is the only visible fork; earlier “mapping” is summary. Still, the embodied payoff lifts it above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s dreamlessness and freight-guard duty anchor a coherent, if austere, interiority; the chess-clock totem externalizes stalled grief and gives his march a singular pulse. His final gesture—placing the clock to freeze the lichen—reads as earned renunciation, distributing himself across probability to guard possibility; the cost (loss of singular self) is legible. Yet the piece never lets us inside a moment of contradiction or mistake; he executes the arc with stoic certainty, flattening micro-choice tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is evocative—bronze tooth pressed to temple, “discordant frequency” behind the eyes—but his choices remain observational. The gear-offer is the only micro-choice that alters tactics; everything else is drift, witness, epiphany. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the stranger does the active “unraveling,” Kael the reactive recognition. Cost is present but conceptual (“silence spread”) rather than embodied; Earned Stasis feels asserted, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s shift from leash-bound anxiety to self-carried courage is embodied in the final refusal to re-clip Atlas; prior micro-choices (hand to star punch, carrying the dog) earn the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—trembling fingers, warm sternum—avoiding diagnostic labels. Flaw functions: the leash is simultaneously safety tether and cage, a clean contradiction. Missing secondary pressure keeps it from 9-band.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star stamp on skin becomes a visible covenant whose warmth pulses cost—“she did not reach for the broken leash.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, lullaby, and stamp accrue until the dawn image reweights meaning. One transition (shore → ridgeway) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. No causal break; steady tightening via doubling path and stamp ritual.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway, tide pools, driftwood archways, and bioluminescent grotto are filtered through Mara’s narrowed threat-attention; each feature either impedes or enables the traverse. The star stamp tool literally marks skin and final image, satisfying micro-setting gate. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and temperature over visual catalog. Spatial choreography stays coherent—guides front/back, dog curled at end.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the woman she had been before anxiety caged her”—is signaled early and tightened when the leash is refused at climax. Agency manifests in the choice to carry Atlas unclipped; cost is the irreversible surrender of the safety tether. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, path doubles back, stamp burns, each increment reweighting fear toward self-trust. No external coincidence resolves the conflict.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—courage as continuance inside fear—emerges through image pattern (shoreline lullaby, star light, rising dawn) rather than statement. Final image of walking into “waiting light” reconfigures earlier twilight vigil without moralizing. Subtextual irony: the broken leash, meant to protect, had been the true cage. Ambiguity lingers: sunrise promises no permanent cure, only the next step.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly adhered to Mara’s perceptual filter—salt-wood voice, fog at ankles, stamp warmth. Rhythm swells and contracts with ascent/descent, mirroring breath. No head-hop; guides remain opaque, voiced only in whispered aphorism that feels tidal, not human. Diction stays within her embodied lexicon; no register drift.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
    <comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long fog-woven clauses to short declaratives at peak beats (“She moved…”). Figurative language is selective—constellations rotating in silver teeth—never clotted. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Minor scaffold: “shoreline lullaby” repeated three times; pattern taught early and pays off in fading hush, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation—silent bellhop probing the cost of safety—remains single-track and intensifies through tactile rediscovery of the bolt/music. Interiority is sensory (“sparks beneath ice”) but occasionally drifts into abstract labels (“seraphically mundane”). The final renunciation lands because earlier beats dramatize the tug between rebellion and custodianship; the bolt hand-off crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    The titan’s refusal to speak in defense, the quiet bare-foot advance, and the single iron-gall pellet carried for millennia crystallize an interior hierarchy of humility over claim; the decisive renunciation of the crown costs him nothing he values yet strips the pretender of everything—an Earned Stasis whose price is felt in the hush of collapsing columns.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s tapping motif and archive dive embody her obsession; the final folding/transmission of the atlas page shows a renunciation that costs her the last private relic. Interiority is concrete—“silent, collective gasp” of coral—but occasional diagnostic summary (“she understood now”) slightly dulls the contradiction under peak pressure. Still, contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) coexist in-scene and the choice is causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s barefoot, awkwardly confident interiority is concrete—"toes curling against the grit" while she deciphers star maps. Her motivation evolves from cataloguing debris to catalysing continuity; the pulse she releases costs her the safety of anonymity and any return to mere observation. Micro-choices (pressing palms to stone, speaking deciphered words) are legible, grounded, and irreversible. Only the "meaning in the mess" epiphany edges toward template profundity, slightly softening the cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—reverence for tradition vs insurgent drive to evolve—are dramatized in the moment she lowers the amber; the plants’ telepathic chorus externalizes her interior split without label-speak. The final smile registers earned cost: she has permanently traded sealed safety for volatile co-creation. Micro-choices (tracing kite symbols, calibrating pool temperature) keep agency on the page. Grandmother label is never allowed to ossify into stereotype; fatigue in her knees and the thumbnail-sized embryo ground her in singular body.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—botanical precision vs. bodily freeze—are on-page throughout; the final choice to open the photo is earned by the somatic armor sequence and costs him the last buffer against raw memory. Interiority stays concrete (taste of copper, needle constellations), never drift into label-speak. Micro-choices (three saplings tomorrow) crystallize the hierarchy: growth > annihilation. Only cap keeps it from 9: no second character to test status shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “charcoal-stained fingers trembling against the spines” anchors us in her bodily dread. The contradictory impulse to both flee surfaces and dive deeper is dramatized through micro-choices: she fondles the broken tarot box, sorts threads, descends. The final self-recognition in the single mirror is credibly earned by the causal chain of untangling. Flaw: occasional diagnostic label-speak (“fragmented reality,” “necessary darkness”) briefly abstracts the pain instead of dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV immersion is total: pink eyes, “serene anger,” the vial warmed against ribs—interiority stays corporeal and conflicted.  No second character means no status crucible, but the self under pressure is sharply drawn.  The final dispersal is an earned renunciation seeded by seventeen-year obsession; cost is the body itself.  Diagnostic label “consciously wild” is the only self-tag, but it is quickly re-embodied in slowed muscle and evaporating flesh, so the slip is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—oath vs revelation—governs every beat; trembling hands and throat tightness embody cost, and the final smile crystallizes her shift from guardian to liberator with earned cost. The 17-year backstory is efficiently anchored to the present choice, meeting BRR limits. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s pacifist conversion from bounty legacy is embodied in every micro-choice—pruning with a former-surgeon’s blade, etching creeds into ballast, refusing the pistol—yet the text occasionally drifts into lyrical summary rather than letting contradiction erupt in a single, painful beat that would push her to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is sensorily rich (“transliterate his anxiety into something heavy…read with his palms like braille”), but the fisher’s cool-headed trait is asserted more than embodied; no contradictory heat under pressure. Micro-choices (zigzag steps, voicing silence) are vivid, yet the final bearing of the fused spike feels slightly unearned because prior emotional risk is lyrically diffuse rather than dramatized as failure or loss. Still, a clear endurance with cost—“marked him as both hunter and hunted”—meets the 600-word threshold for credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her “solemn playfulness” and habit of testing truth with a pen nib show contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation (publishing the correction) is earned by the prior causal chain of discovery and carries visible economic/social cost. Micro-choices under pressure are present, but the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off the table, capping depth. Still, the arc from loyal heir to self-orphaning truth-teller is credibly fueled by her observant nature and ancestral guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s guilt is palpable and embodied, but the younger self remains a mute projection; the shoulder-touch lands as tenderness rather than a crucible that forces a visible choice or cost on the page. The final “harmony” is asserted, not dramatized through a renunciation or new risk, so the emotional arc feels resolved by fiat rather than earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“pulse flutter with dreamlike apprehension,” fingers vibrating “like a trapped bee.” Her contradictory impulses (whimsy vs. diagnostic urgency) coexist in-scene, and the final chalk mark on the wall is an earned micro-choice with felt cost. No secondary character appears, so status bullets are waived; her socially perceptive read of the lonely grotto is dramatized, not labeled. The only micro-drag is a faint therapeutic tinge (“architecture of doubt”) but it is quickly grounded in tactile sand and chalk.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid—"arms of steel… cradle empathy" embodies the contradiction—but the retrocognitive torrent is recalled more than enacted; no moment shows Kael overwhelmed or nearly mis-stepping, so the promised flaw stays off-stage. Final renunciation lands because the pocketed tessera carries tactile cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Julian’s synesthetic ghost is vividly particular—“applause as spiraling ribbons of amber and rust” embodies perception.  His encore hunger converts to caretaker agency the instant Mara appears, a credible pivot under the garden’s pressure.  The tarot-coin transfer crystallizes cost: he forfeits his last anchor, she forfeits suicide.  One beat only from Mara keeps her below co-protagonist status; still, her micro-choice to drop the cutter is embodied and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—rational doubt vs tactile rescue mission—play out in live gesture; the geode’s cooling at the end shows earned cost. Interiority stays concrete ("stomach clenching") rather than diagnostic. The single weakness: the brother memory is summoned twice but never pressed into a micro-choice that risks failure, so the final shift feels slightly pre-ordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s alien POV is rendered with tactile specificity (thermal sensors, anti-grav hover, fossil pulse) and a coherent hierarchy of values: data-collection vs. meaning-making. Interior contradiction is absent—no moment where the mission conflicts with an emergent desire—so the arc is static. The “voice of the unknown” motivation is asserted, not pressure-tested; the fossil anchor never forces a sacrifice or rethink. Earned stasis is credible, but emotional cost is diffuse rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers moving among buttons, the whispered canyon echo—but the epiphany “time could be folded, not merely poured” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-moments, so the final renunciation feels lightly earned. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her agency satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s contradictory drives—guilt over dead agents vs. need for repair—are dramatized in the pillbox hand-off; the embodied shudder in her gloved fingers shows cost. Marcus as secondary pressure forces the final renunciation, shifting their status from handler/asset to co-conspirators. Micro-choice hierarchy (surrender the last chip > preserve life) is legible and scaled to length. Missing 9-band only because interiority flirts with label-speak (“tired of being broken”) instead of pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the coachman’s stitching, skin-read of rain, and cheek-cool detection reveal a calm, methodical mind under vow-bound pressure. The palimpsest promise gives him a layered motive that tightens into the final boarding. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page—he never hesitates—so the arc is steady rather than crucible-forced, keeping him just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s interiority is specific and embodied—her fingers “finding the rhythm of the earth,” the vibration “in her teeth”—and her renunciation of honey is credibly foreshadowed by the meditation on acceptance. The only lapse is the late, overt diagnostic line “Kai understood then,” which momentarily abstracts what the body has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the garden relic while needing to leave it—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (pocketing the gauge, gripping the oars). The final renunciation of the fire-escape identity is earned by the prior beats of calibration and rowing; cost is visible in the cold metal against her thigh and the dawn vigil. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. One hairline slip: “wistfully pragmatic” is used twice as authorial label rather than dramatized trait, slightly diluting the contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—mourning her past identity vs. forging a solitary future—are vividly embodied in her handling of the sundial and her willingness to sit inside the humming stones. The reincarnation memory is not just backstory; it tilts her present micro-choices (climbing the terrace, placing the dial, staying cross-legged) and produces a credible renunciation with visible cost: the “last fragile piece of her old self snap cleanly away.” Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Earned stasis is reached, but the beat is single-track; no secondary character pressure is possible, so the crucible is purely intra-subjective—sufficient for this length but capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—writing desire for others while stifling her own—anchors every beat; the twig-by-twig surrender of her self-exile is embodied in blistered fingers and the “phantom weight of pens.”
    The final hand-taking with Mara is earned because the installation has visibly cost her anonymity and 17 years of silence.
    Still, Mara appears only in the last 100 words; the relationship crucible is asserted more than dramatized, muting the full cost scale.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—charts under her fingernail, headset badge catching sodium light—but “cautiously hopeful” is stated four times rather than shown through shifting risk calculus. Micro-choices (patching generator, pushing transmitter past redline) track her hierarchy of values; cost appears in trembling hands and ozone smell. The flaw: no contradictory impulse on the page—she never wavers or doubts the subsonic plan—so the arc is linear, not crucible. Still, the endurance costs her physically and socially, earning a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s claustrophobia is embodied in the pulsing limestone and “screaming mind,” while her grandfather’s compass point externalizes a generational through-line; the final act of transfixing the gears crystallizes her hierarchy of values—precision over panic—with a trembling hand that costs her nothing physically but everything psychologically.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s prosopagnosia and artistic gift create a sharp, usable contradiction; the interiority stays concrete (“her hands knew how to render them”) and the final thaw is earned by the quarry session. Still, the rival’s identity arrives as external data, not through her blind-spot blunder—so the flaw doesn’t quite bite her. A stronger causal mistake would have pushed this past 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s obsession with vindicating Mara is vivid and embodied; her trembling fingers, copper-nail burn, and final transmission choice show a legible value hierarchy. Interior contradiction—idealism hardened into “stubborn conviction”—is stated, not simultaneously dramatized in a single beat, muting the highest band. The renunciation of institutional silence lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite minor emotional paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s guilt-locked silence and the itch for “never” are vivid; the micro-choice to raise the fiddle despite bleeding fingers embodies cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the hitchhiker remains a cipher—no contradiction shown, yet relationship pressure is absent. The final renunciation of silence is earned by the glass-flake cue and scaffold path. Voice convergence is N/A; single-POV texture is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—corporate polish vs. hereditary predation—are kept alive in every beat; the final renunciation of the train-circus lair feels earned because each micro-choice (nailing the rupee, spreading bills like maps) has visibly rehearsed the same extraction instinct he now rejects. Interiority is embodied, never diagnostic. Cost is felt when he steps onto the coupling “armed with the dusky harmony of knowing,” a charged poise that forecloses both father’s violence and startup delusion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s grief-propelled quest is concrete; her micro-choice to press the telegram to the dome crystallizes a believable renunciation. Yet the interiority leans on abstract labels (“weight of human sorrow”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The shift from lone scholar to communal dream-sharer is legible but the cost feels intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guardedness is shown through her refusal to flinch and her readiness to keep the empty vial; the druidic vocation is embodied in the katas and seed-use. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where her serenity cracks—so the “sorrow” of the final line feels announced rather than dramatized. Still, her micro-choices (planting feet, releasing seed) align with motive and carry visible cost, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority crackles: “roots say the glade will shift” marries embodied pain to oracle duty. Scars-as-circuit gives Kael mirrored motive and tactile bond, but the pair’s final leap to “weave the new covenant” is asserted rather than dramatized—no micro-choice shows what thread they actually pull. Still, contradictory impulses (stay rooted / run) coexist in scene and the shared scar cost lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-immolation vs. guardianship—are embodied in the same beats (kissing bark while roots pin him). Interiority is concrete, never clinical; “reckless idealist” is shown through trespass and barter, not label. Final endurance is earned: he bargains, is bound, accepts irrevocable cost. Flaw: sister’s laughter referenced but never sounded in flash or echo, so emotional hole feels generic, trimming the top.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—meticulous appraisal vs. mercy-driven falsification—play out in one continuous beat; the “confidently uncertain” lie costs him professional integrity on the page. Interiority stays concrete, rooted in tactile memory of rigging amps and the metallic ghost of applause. Micro-choice at climax (authenticating the fake) crystallizes hierarchy of values: mercy > accuracy, with visible cost to credibility. Flaw complicates choice without tidy redemption; voice remains specific to ex-roadie turned appraiser.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, methodical interiority is consistent and particular; his trembling fingers, recitation of Sumerian, and final surrender all spring from the same traits. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and desperate longing is held in scene, not toggled. The earned dissolution is credible because his life-long translator mindset has prepared him to “become the bridge.” Only the “haunted ambitions” label floats unattached until the final image reweights it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The librarian’s waxing-waning strength gives a bodily stake, but interior contradiction stays abstract (“permanence and motion are partners”) rather than enacted in scene. No micro-choice visibly hurts; the smelt is accepted without friction or cost felt in the brass body. The identities surrender, yet the librarian’s own desire or fear remains off-page, so the arc is observation, not struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight…settling between her ribs”), but the epiphany is stated rather than dramatized in real time; the final renunciation is legible yet leans on abstract summary rather than a last observable micro-choice that seals cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—methodical cataloguer vs. self-annihilating sister—are alive in every tactile choice; the decision to play the taped accordion enacts the micro-shift from anesthesia to exposure with embodied cost. The final weep while the bellows hold is earned because the instrument’s fragility literalizes her own patched-together capacity to carry grief forward. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic cliché; the trembling hands are tied to recognition, not withdrawal symptoms. One hairline slip: “dangerous clarity of unsilenced thoughts” flirts with label-speak, but is immediately grounded by sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The veiled dreamer's interiority is vivid—her breath catching in "cautious exuberance" shows embodied, contradictory emotion. Her seventeen-year quest is anchored in a childhood wound (the unspoken goodbye), making her presence in the library feel earned. The only drag is that her final moment of triumph—“she knew she had found exactly what she sought”—is stated rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is palpable: the jasmine contact makes her jerk back, the coffee stains bloom like “dark continents,” her hierarchy of values—truth vs. safety—gets dramatized in the trembling lift of the violin. Contradictory impulses (melt it / keep it) coil inside every beat; the final renunciation is earned because we have felt the cold bite and the “mulberry ache” long before she sings the perforating note.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive—capture a last spark before oblivion—anchors every micro-gesture, but the interior contradiction (grace vs. terrible theft) is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; we see ritual precision, not the moment she flinches or accelerates. The “decades of learning” backstory is summarized, not pressure-tested on-page, so the final act feels predetermined rather than earned under live strain. Still, her perceptual signature—synaptic snowstorm, ionized shimmer—remains specific and welded to action, keeping her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s centuries-long grief and the hairpin’s weight are vivid; the renunciation to plant it is embodied and costly. Interiority borders on self-diagnosis (“contentment was not a destination…”) but stays tethered to the tactile burial. Missing on-page contradiction/flaw undercuts full complicity; he already knows the lesson before the beat. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy is legible and the endurance lands as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s “sincerely insincere” paradox is dramatized through embodied ritual: accepting silver, fabricating absolution, tasting mirror edges. Interior contradiction peaks when he lifts the toxic cloak—his tremble makes protected vulnerability legible. Cost lands as he lets the garment dissolve; fraudulence remains yet now includes “perhaps,” a credible renunciation of absolute trade. Cartographer is off-stage, so no relationship crucible tested.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    The regressing-body device externalizes an interior contradiction—memory as future, certainty as erasure—that fuels every micro-choice; the final renunciation of answers for questions is earned by the lifetime of withheld ripples. Embodied emotion is precise: softer palms, heavier stone, tooth-ache hum. One flawless detail—“his memories becoming predictions”—compresses the arc into a single, painful pulse. No slips; cost is visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    Interiority is poetic but abstract; contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized (“he needed to appraise its significance… anchor or anchor”). No embodied emotion beyond dust settling; the sole micro-choice is the final acceptance of stasis, which is declared, not visibly struggled toward. Earned stasis is asserted without prior causality showing why this moment costs him. Character remains a monolith of theme, not an individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for imperfect beauty while lashed to a metrics engine—remains vivid and body-level (“frost-rimed calibration dials” against “mechanical indifference”). The micro-choice to unstrap and step onto unsecured mist is credible, irreversible, and paid for with physical peril and social erasure. The final endurance (becoming myth rather than metric) dramatizes a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the line “why he had failed within the automated system” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodied emotion a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet devotion to the submerged library and his grandmother’s cryptic charge feel lived-in; the 12-year night-shift endurance and the tuning-fork choice crystallize a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—violet light on book spines, key warming in palm—avoiding label-speak. The only flaw: the “twelve years” summary is told, not dramatized, slightly blunting cost. Still, his final seated vigil among floating violet reads as earned stasis with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is vivid ("stellar doubt gnawed"), coins-as-nodes externalize conflict, but the backwards-prophecy logic is accepted too smoothly—no micro-choice visibly wrestles with the paradox before the final dial-turn; cost is felt yet not personally scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The reaper’s grief is embodied in concrete micro-choices—leaning the scythe aside, unfolding the atlas, reaching through ice. Interior contradiction is vivid: he both clings to and releases her by naming the monsters. The final renunciation—scythe becomes pen—pays off prior causality with felt cost. Only slip: “heartbroken” is named once in self-diagnosis rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“lukewarm” talent vs. iron diligence—and every micro-choice (counting drops, aligning shards) flows from that tension. Embodied emotion is precise: trembling fingers, dried-coral mallet, salt crust on stone. The only bar to 9+ is that the moral calculus never sharpens: she risks nothing personal beyond exhaustion, so the cost feels environmental, not interior.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s guilt-sharpened vigilance is credibly lived-in, but the climactic “spin stories into shared meaning” turn is telegraphed more than dramatized—the interior pivot arrives as a single reflective paragraph rather than a pressured micro-choice visible on the page. The embodied emotion is strong early (gnarled fingers, trembling on the label) yet levels off once he begins gathering photos; contradiction under pressure never re-ignites. Closure is still earned because the satchel load visibly forecloses silence, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally re-enacted in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skeptical scholar vs. wonder-craving child—are dramatized in every tactile beat; the wooden-horse offering and crystal ignition crystallize her stakes with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final integration is earned because each micro-choice (stepping through water, placing toy, releasing flame) arises from prior causal logic. Only the hair-color tag feels ornamental, a hairline slip in an otherwise singular psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s embodied expertise and micro-choices under pressure are vivid; the muscle-memory buckle revision and readiness to leap anchor her arc. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where instinct wars with doubt—so the watcher’s burden feels more assigned than wrestled with. Still, the final click conveys earned stewardship and residual fear, satisfying the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—vacancy vs. the clone’s hunger to live—are dramatized in the forehead-to-brain contact; the micro-choice to open the jar and fuse costs her the last shield of numbness, earning the tear-tracked reawakening. Interiority stays concrete (“salt cutting tracks down cheeks that had forgotten sensation”). The only slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling mid-paragraph (“ego death was not an ending but a partner”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s inventive drive is vivid, but her interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“innovation required killing...comfortable expectations”) rather than embodied contradiction. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; her micro-choice to plant the seed is present yet cost feels prospective, not yet paid. The promised “genuine struggle” is deferred to future players; we witness planning, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s mournfully eager stance is embodied in every spectral gesture; the translucent pull-cord handle becomes an extension of his regret. His contradictory impulse—to speak yet remain voiceless—drives every micro-choice, turning the maceration of silence into a physical, tactile endurance test. The final release of the handle into silver dust is earned: it is the visible cost of a love that can no longer speak its name yet refuses to abandon the living.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior life is lush—“dimensionally homesick heart…welcoming new uncertainties like guests”—but contradiction stays reflective; no moment shows guardian choosing against a live alternative, only renouncing a summons never dramatized. Emotions are embodied in mist/breath/pendant, yet the sole micro-choice—curling around the oak while swallowing the call—lacks immediate stakes because birth-dimension threat is abstract. Renunciation lands as Charged Poise, satisfying arc, but cost is conceptual rather than felt, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—preserving identity vs. unmaking it—are embodied in how he handles the crucible, yet the shift from despair to possibility is slightly under-costed; we feel relief more than sacrifice. Micro-choices (temperature tweaks, final calculated degree) track credibly, but the interiority flirts with self-diagnosis (“understood with the clarity…”) that softens the flaw’s edge. Still, the renunciation of the crozier’s old meaning lands with visible soot on his hands, earning the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s lifelong vocation and methodical pragmatism are vivid, embodied in micro-choices like pocketing protocol to set the fragment on the naked oscillator. The interior contradiction—empirical interpreter seduced by silence—drives the climax, but her predecessor’s fate is told, not dramatized, softening the felt cost of repeating it.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through embodied action—whistling through hurricanes, steady radio calls—rather than label-speak. The empty hourglass functions as an extension of his perception, tilting in his palm to guide micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; we see no moment where optimism collides with a credible urge to surrender, so the final “permanent transient” state feels more bestowed than wrestled for. Still, his consistent perceptual filter and the cost of eternal ferrying land as a believable Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s interior voice is lush but abstract; “texture of connection” is repeated without ever being felt in her body. The final surrender is declared, not dramatized—no visible cost or hierarchy of values is tested. Micro-choices are absent; she simply keeps stitching until she dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mara’s grief-wonder stance is vivid, but her interiority drifts into explanatory abstraction (“the peculiar mixture of grief and cosmic wonder”) that blurs embodied contradiction. The final decision to launch the expedition is voiced rather than dramatized; we watch her instruct, not feel the irreversible cost of leaving the only home her students have ever known. She is competent throughout; no visible flaw or doubt tightens the choice. The anchor chain embodies memory, yet never endangers or tests her—so the object does not act as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—she smells twilight, feels moth-thumps in her ear, chooses descent without backup. The contradictory pull between archival duty and living rescue is shown, not labelled, and the final hand-clasp crystallizes a value hierarchy with visible cost. No stock therapy-speak; only the pulse of decision under ghost-pressure. The shift from tracer to rescuer is earned because the hearing-aid breadcrumb literally forks into two heartbeats that force her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and vocation as spelunker crystallize in one charged image—palm on glass, tide swallowing sun—so the internal contradiction is dramatized, not labelled. Her choice to re-enter the facility and extend the gold fleck is a visible micro-choice that escalates stakes and forecloses retreat. The final “crashing hush” she carries is a credible, embodied cost. Only the researchers remain symbolic vessels rather than relational pressure, but at this length the arc still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—digital corpse yet breathing—grounds every micro-choice; the heartbeat-count is embodied, not diagnostic. The porcelain shard pressed to jugular then ink then spectrometer stages a hierarchy of values: flesh > memory > data. The final integration—“wisdom of the failure becoming her own”—earns its renunciation of enumerated survival. Only the slight over-articulation “someone who had evolved beyond the binary” keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s quiet articulation under lethal pressure is embodied through micro-choices (whispering the myth, footfall harmonics) that foreclose her own voice with visible cost. Interior contradiction—preserve language vs. surrender her last breath of it—drives every beat. The renunciation at the end is earned: she trades her living utterance for resonant fossil, veins dimming in legible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s contradictory drives—scientist vs. seeker, grief vs. gallows humor—are dramatized in embodied beats (arrowhead burning, levitating bones). The final surrender to cryptid-hood is earned by the escalating sensory cost; her bitterness mutates into laughter that literally reshapes her body. Interiority stays concrete, though one line flirts with diagnostic self-labeling. Flaws complicate every beat; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority stays concrete—pulse inside the locust shell, bow tremor—yet the decisive shift from observer to insurgent is told more than embodied; the laugh on the swaying bridge is the first clear cost shown. A contradictory impulse (fear of falling vs. need to free the valley) is named but not played simultaneously in scene. Still, her value hierarchy (music > safety) is legible in the final forward step, earning a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marek’s stubborn quiet—bowing at checkpoints while memorizing drone corridors—gives us a believable, embodied contradiction. The satchel cutting his shoulder and the static crackle on his skin when he uncorks the storm make his rebellion tactile, not symbolic. His refusal to be recognized by either faction is a credible flaw that costs him authority yet buys three minutes of usable blindness. The final renunciation—no applause, no witness—pays the price in full.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s muteness, carpenter patience, and the moment his throat “unlocked” are vividly embodied; the thirteen-year silence is the only label-heavy beat. Micro-choice—cupping the fragment and deciding to return with tools—crystallizes his shift from witness to maker with visible cost (voice reclaimed yet still solitary). Interior contradiction (silence as prison vs workshop) drives every beat; no second character on page so relationship bullets waived. Earned stasis: he accepts the continued burden of rebuilding alone, halo fragment warm against chest—price felt.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s single-minded quest to resurrect her grandmother’s story is vividly interiorized through the tactile scarf, but the absence of any second character keeps relational pressure off the page; her “sanely eccentric” label is shown rather than asserted, yet the beat-to-beat micro-choices are mostly forward motion through geometry rather than friction with an opposing will. The final smile registers as earned renunciation, but the cost feels conceptual, not viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s hollow-chest grief and her single-minded drive to lure the runaway dream are vivid; her embodied trembling, palette-as-vessel, and the final sigh of success show interior contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to use sunrise as bait (not nets or spells) crystallizes values, and the closing image of “luminous absence” carries visible cost. Flaw: no second character, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are absent by scope; interiority occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction (“cipher of longing”) rather than concrete contradiction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vey’s quiet refusal to accept impossibility is shown through embodied action—spinning until shadows stagger—but the interior contradiction between grief for the poet and professional duty stays summary. The final smile registers cost, yet the hair-ribbon’s loss feels symbolic rather than a personal wound that forecloses any future path. Enough micro-choices (spinning, whispering the star-name, releasing the light) align with motive to earn the change, but one more beat of interior friction would have pushed her into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena’s 30-year vigil is credibly obsessive, but the interiority is mostly externalized through catalogued detail rather than live contradiction under pressure; the single micro-choice of stepping into the ring is under-dramatized and her emotional hierarchy is asserted (“chronically curious ache”) rather than embodied mid-wade. We see no simultaneous impulse to retreat or fear of losing herself, so the final act feels pre-determined by research rather than earned through visible internal friction. Lila’s return is touching but Elena’s cost is off-loaded onto the vanished fungi; the calloused folklorist hand is a nice final embodiment, yet it arrives after closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—tender caretaker vs. pitiless mentor—are dramatized in her backward walks and the hammer-hover; the child-shadow’s agency is shown through micro-gestures. Both arcs end in an earned renunciation (hammer lowered, forward step) that visibly costs Elara her isolating ritual. Interiority stays concrete; “ferocious love” is embodied, not labeled. Only the child’s interiority is necessarily veiled, so the slight asymmetry is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s interiority is lush but abstract—“insatiably creative,” “low flame,” etc.—and we never feel a contradictory impulse undercut his serene resolve. The single beat of pressing the seed supplies motive, yet no micro-choice afterward tests or reframes it; endurance costs are asserted (“exhausted”) rather than dramatized. Because no relationship or secondary character exerts pressure, the arc is a steady funnel rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her cracked mask as self-inflicted lens, her acceptance of silence as weight—but the story keeps her at a single, static register of tragic clarity; no contradictory impulse ever complicates the beat-to-beat choices. The final “she had become the net” lands as conceptual, not earned by a visible shift in her tactics or emotional cost. Reflection dominates action; we’re told she understands fracture, yet the only micro-choice on stage is the unvarying needle motion. Still, the voice-specific perceptual filter is strong enough to lift her above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s methodically curious trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—tracing fibers, frame-by-frame film comparison, clearing turf with “reverent hesitation”—that steadily escalate stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“silence teach her its vocabulary”) and culminates in a credible renunciation: she leaves the map torn, paying the cost of preserving wonder. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the slight reserve keeps this just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Julian’s interiority—cataloguing light refraction, calculating 37 Hz—shows a consistent, character-specific mind; the closing renunciation of “salvage history” feels earned because every beat has been filtered through his analytic gaze and grief-tempered friendship with Death. The only minor slip is that Death’s on-page presence is more atmospheric than pressure-bearing, so the crucible effect is slightly muted.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s lonely artistry and need to give voice to the mute machine are vivid; her decision to “encode herself into the physical world” is foreshadowed by her earlier acid etchings. Interior contradiction is thin—she never questions whether merging with a ghost is safe or desirable—so the arc edges toward tidy. Cost is poetic rather than visceral: “tinkersong wonder fading into a single sustained note” is felt, but not acutely personal. Still, her micro-choices (pressing the plate, singing back) track cleanly with her vocation and isolation, earning a solid high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “warmly inquisitive” stance is shown through tactile micro-choices (tracing pages, aligning wheels) that alter her trajectory; the diary reading reframes her identity. Yet her interiority slips into summary (“understood his motivation with sudden clarity”) rather than dramatized contradiction, and the leap from servant to inheritor of the captain’s “secret” is asserted, not earned under pressure. Still, embodied details—breath fogging goggles, diary pressed to ribs—keep contradiction alive enough to justify a solid mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for tethered safety yet embracing severance—peaks in the knot-tying scene, earning a credible shift. Emotions are embodied through tactile handling of telescope & twine, avoiding label-speak. Micro-choice (aiming lens at “space between clouds”) crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she foregoes rescue for atmospheric witness. The arc lands as Earned Stasis; motivation tracks, though we never see her fight the balloon’s drift—she’s purely reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s face-blind synesthesia and tactile pigment-mastery drive every beat; her fractal seeing and “mirror the sky” obsession feel inseparable from her body. Interiority stays concrete—she “traces grain,” “memorizes texture like a beloved face,” never slides into label-speak. The renunciation at the threshold—walking out without watching the fall—pays the cost of her limit in one clean image. Only minor: no second character on-page, so status crucible unused, but single-POV depth satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s diligent curiosity and isolation are vividly embodied—she talks to the hull, sketches starlings, kneels in soot. Interior contradiction is light (no competing want v. need), and the final “smile” costs nothing visible; the arc is realization, not sacrifice. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent, and the micro-choice to kneel/decipher grounds the shift. Enough for a solid mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and personal from the first line; her interiority is sensuously embodied (“trembling fingers,” “hands moving instinctively”) and her micro-choice to uncap the vial directly triggers the climax. The only flaw is a trace of therapeutic self-explanation (“restoration required driftwood patience”) that momentarily abstracts her cost instead of letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s guarded hope and survivor’s vigilance feel concrete; her decision to ring the bell atop the arch crystallizes a earned shift from isolation to kinship. Interiority stays embodied (“struggled to trust the silence”) rather than abstract. The ghost’s motivation is purely altruistic, so lacks contradiction, but Mara’s micro-choice under the arch carries visible cost—she now tends an orchard she once merely survived.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—her trembling hands, weathered cheek—but contradictory impulses surface only in metaphor (“mathematics of entropy” vs. “lullaby”). The final act of singing is telegraphed early, so renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than freshly earned. Micro-choices (aligning fractures, tracing the jaw) are present yet carry generic tenderness; the cost is cosmic, not personal. Still, her solitude and tactile attention to the puppet keep her from archetype drift.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-guilt and reluctant competence feel lived-in; her methodical micro-placement of nuts while muttering complaints embodies the “graceless beauty” paradox. The flashback to finding her brother’s bones arrives late yet crystallizes why she endures the curse-cost; her final quiet collapse carries palpable exhaustion. Interiority is concrete (“shoulders hunched…fingers precise”) and contradictory impulses coexist—duty vs resentment—without psych-talk labels. Only the brother beat feels compressed; a moment of irrational self-blame mid-action would have tightened motivation to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Grief, guilt, and scientific perception braid convincingly; the micro-choice to lift and offer the chrysalis crystallizes her shift. Interiority stays concrete—foam = polymer chains—yet the final “I hear it now” drifts toward tidy epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. Earned cost is felt, but emotional cadence softens a hair too soon.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s desire to reach the “white room” is legible, but her interior contradiction—trading amnesia for freedom yet craving origin—stays abstract; no embodied emotion or micro-choice dramatizes the cost of stepping through the incision, so the final renunciation feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s tactile obsession with “sandpapering” remorse is viscerally embodied; the glove removal beat crystallizes her risk. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—yet the decade of stored grief is told, not dramatized, softening the contradiction that drives her. The final steady-handed walk-off earns renunciation cost, but the moment of assimilation is summarized rather than micro-chosen, muting the earned edge.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s seventeen-year fixation and trembling arms give us embodied, high-stakes motive; the single-POV interiority stays concrete. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene—she climbs, places, sings without hesitation—so the “empathetically decisive” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through internal friction, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—scientist vs grave-robber of lost dreams—is vivid, but the prose keeps explaining her metamorphosis instead of letting us feel it. The mirror-to-temple gesture is the only embodied beat; everything else is abstracted into “neurotransmitters,” “quantum foam,” “helical structure.” Because the transformation is declared rather than dramatized, the final “living archive” feels bestowed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s prism-minded trait is shown through spatial perception and memory palace filing, but interior contradiction is asserted (“refraction of loyalty”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. She takes one visible risk—snatching a seed—yet the cost feels prospective, not immediate, so the beat lands closer to functional than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for sound in a mute world—drives every micro-choice; her bow-stroke is a renunciation of silence that costs her tears. The “symphonically minded” trait is not label-speak but embodied in how she maps wood grain as score. One flaw: the hedgehog’s agency is over-credited; the creature never truly pressures her choice, so the external crucible is soft. Still, the final weep is earned stasis: she pays in solitude for the first note.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is dense, specific, and anchored to the tactile (worry-stone dent, magnetic tremor in the knees). The contradiction between strategic intellect and emotional blindness is dramatized in-scene, not diagnosed. The micro-choice to follow the curved knight-path rather than the clean diagonal crystallizes his seven-year shift and costs him the last of his former certainty—felt in the stone splitting along his fingerprint. Closure links exile, flaw, and re-engagement without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elio’s pacifist-obsessive interiority is vivid and embodied (“cataloging the varieties of silence” as tactile labor), but the arc is pure ascent—no contradictory impulse or error undercuts him, so the “earned cost” test is soft. The diary opens because he already possesses the exact empathy frequency; no flaw complicates the triumph. Still, his micro-choices under pressure (tuning oscillators while fireworks threaten to drown the room) keep the portrait specific and active.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s olfactory gift and ambition are concrete, but interiority drifts into abstract self-help (“endurance itself was a form of medicine”) rather than embodied contradiction. The seed-planting choice is steady, yet no micro-choice visibly risks or forfeits anything on the page; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Interior conflict is announced, not enacted in split-scene impulse. Still, her sensory POV is specific and the lineage dread feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motive to locate “resilience” is concrete, embodied in the altitude-sick lurch of her rig and the twelve-minute countdown; her single micro-choice—reaching to touch the arrow tip—crystallizes the internal contradiction between scientific extraction and ancestral caretaking. The beat carries visible cost: the rig is biomechanically rewired while she absorbs centuries of stewardship, a bodily inheritance she can never un-know. No contradiction in traits; the epiphany is earned by prior sensory stacking rather than label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s investigative drive is vivid and embodied—every anemometer reading, every boot-crunch of crystallized residue shows her mind at work. The patch acts as both compass and moral tether, grounding her choices in Chen’s fate. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; her “smile despite the respirator” crystallizes the cost of knowledge. The only gap: we never feel a contradictory impulse that might complicate her relentless forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s synesthetic interiority is vivid and character-specific; her collapsing against the ice after the final bell shows embodied fatigue. However, the text never lets contradictory impulses share a beat—her resolve is monolithic, so the choice feels predetermined rather than wrested from self-conflict. The cost is present but generalized (“certify wonder”), not personal or irreversible. Still, within a single POV and zero on-page relationships, the portrait is rich enough to earn solid mid-tier excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira’s contradiction—paralysis then deliberate correction—plays out on the page through embodied micro-choices (trembling fingers, breath-controlled steps). The final renunciation of guardianship is earned by the causal chain of failure, atonement, and visible cost: the flute is silenced, the range exhales. No label-speak; interiority stays concrete and sensory. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsessive need to quantify emotion drives every action; the interior contradiction—seeking precision through theft of selves—peaks when she feeds the cartographer’s page into the halo. Bodily detail (“fingers ink-black,” “sweating”) grounds her manipulations, and the final cost is visible: the cartographer reduced to a drawer-font. The borrowed-personality trait activates twice (workshop trickery, halo transposition), forcing a tactic shift each time, so the quick test is met.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s shift from anxious courier to patient myth-maker is embodied in micro-choices—glove adjust, pendant touch, stopping to speak—each tied to the vibrating talisman. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment he “understood then why Maren left” is slightly abstract; still, the final steady-hand image shows earned change with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and character-specific—“mathematical precision of light and ice” versus “truthful lies”—and the prism-burn in her palm embodies cost. The shift from scholar to mourner is legible, but the beat is single-register; we never feel her doubt rearing once the frost starts lifting, so the contradiction pulse required for 9+ is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s grief-hardened resolve is embodied in every micro-choice: selecting the bead, cutting her finger to glue the puzzle edges, finally surrendering her substance to the weave. The interior contradiction—clinging to memory while dissolving self—plays out in scene, not summary. The final smile crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is her extinction, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s quiet-forged persistence is embodied in every micro-choice—wrapping the silk, counting hammer strikes, climbing out empty-handed—so her final “architect of return” identity lands as earned renunciation rather than label. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers trembling not from exhaustion but from the weight”) and avoids stock diagnostic talk. The only minor slack: “meek” is declared early but never contradicted in-scene by an observable mis-step or self-recrimination, so the contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to undo her mentor’s sin yet ultimately choosing to bear witness—are dramatized in the spiraling bay; the final renunciation costs her the comfort of ignorance and makes her body the map, a price felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s reticence and observant nature are vividly embodied through tactile micro-choices—sealing the jar, stacking stones—each revealing a hierarchy of values without label-speak. The contradiction between her hunger for anonymity and her need to be seen drives every beat; the final renunciation of the letter costs her the last chance to speak and is earned by the entire chain of withheld gestures. Interiority stays salt-cold and specific: “bottle the feeling of safety… where absolute vigilance met absolute vulnerability.” Only the absence of another living character keeps the crucible from full ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s tactile obsession with the wick, the storm-laugh that leaks into wind, and the final pocketed humming give a singular bodily signature; interiority stays concrete. Yet the narrative keeps him in a single register of exaltation—no contradictory impulse cracks the mask—so “earned” cost feels atmospheric rather than personally paid. The ancestry whisper is backstory-only and never complicates his tactics; micro-choices amount to “whisper / laugh / release.” Still, the embodied mythic persona is memorable and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Porous receptivity vs self-protective caution is dramatized through the wing-handling and sunrise tracking; the moment she releases the wing is earned by the preceding micro-choices and embodied scar-pulse. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the donor-heart “translator” image gives credible emotional scaffolding. Still, the shift from passive observation to final release could use one earlier actionable risk to make the renunciation feel steeper.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire to “hear” the petrified trees is vivid and embodied; her moon-bound healing trait and ritual handling of the sextant give consistent micro-choices. The final shift from custodian to “gardener” is credible, yet the interior contradiction between scientific curiosity and spiritual need is told more than dramatized in-scene, keeping her shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is legible—rekindle the dying realm—and her embodied emotion (“burning like cold fire”) is vivid. Yet her interior contradiction remains abstract; we never feel her hesitate, fear, or weigh loss while she sings. The final integration of her “scattered selves” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—empathic hunger vs reclusive terror—are dramatized in the single beat of unlatching the door; the embodied cost (he “settles deeper into his shadows,” forfeiting any future claim to the invitation) makes the renunciation legible. Interiority is concrete until the closing clause “infinitely connected,” which slips toward label-speak, shaving the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s quiet perseverance and soil-whispering vocation feel distinct; her “heuristically gentle” restraint is shown in micro-choices (smuggling compost, rainwater bowls). Interiority stays anchored to tactile detail—no label-speak. The final refusal to announce but simply share bread crystallizes her values with visible cost (the relic loaf is gone). Secondary cast function as chorus, so status/relationship pressure is minimal, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s solitary devotion to measurement under extinction-pressure is credibly lived-in; her micro-choices (sampling, calibrating, ledger-closing) flow from the stated “gently meticulous” trait. The final stoic endurance is earned by seventeen years of shown habit. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into therapy-speak. Missing higher band because no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never hesitates or considers stopping, so tension is purely external clock, not self-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her palm-reading of the fob’s warmth, her stagger-act calibrated to enforcer spacing—and her contradictory wish to stay invisible yet brandish the heirloom drives every beat. The recording objective is clear, but the emotional cost is only implied; we feel tension, not the visceral knife-twist of betraying her father’s world. Still, her micro-choices (feigned drunken stumble, visible bait) foreclose retreat and individuate her from stock “avenging daughter.”

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—doubt as phosphorescent pulse—remains concrete and embodied throughout; her micro-choice to offer her skeptical light enacts the final reconfiguration. Yet the thunder-bearer’s sudden assertion that “your skepticism is the final component” feels externally delivered, not mined from prior shown stakes, slightly undercutting earned agency. Still, the taste-shift method consistently externalizes internal flux without label-speak, keeping emotional arc legible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—parlor-trick servitude vs. authentic creation—are dramatized in-scene through the lock-picking micro-choices; the final renunciation of the surface world carries visible cost (“charcoal fingers itching”) and is earned by prior causal chain. Memory gift is more label than embodied constraint until the watermark moment; slight softening of interior contradiction in peak beat keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurelia’s drive to recover lost words is vivid, but interiority blurs into lyric summary (“she believed…”) instead of dramatized contradiction. The leaves’ physical reaction supplies embodied cost, yet her one visible micro-choice—trusting Marcus—arrives already summarized. Earned stasis lands, but the missing beat of active temptation keeps her arc just shy of full causal integration.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s seasonal muteness and tactile precision are embodied in every micro-adjustment; her hierarchy of values—wonder over utility—drives every beat. The final release of the brake crystallizes her life’s work with visible cost: she stands back breathless, altitude and age exacting payment. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the portrayal is otherwise exemplary for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael-9’s nostalgia is palpable through gesture and micro-choice; the android cradles the fear-box rather than deleting it, dramatizing machine/emotion contradiction. Interiority remains specific to a synthetic mind (“positronic core,” “compressed archive”). The final renunciation—archiving fears instead of purging—carries visible cost on the page. Flaw: some reflection drifts toward label-speak (“childhood fears”) without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s “listening heals” motive is declared early and her micro-choice to trail Mr. Alvarez at fifty paces shows restrained agency, yet her interiority rarely breaks beyond curated lyricism; the locket moment is a guess, not a tested contradiction, so the final offering feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific, but the text labels emotions (“shame,” “grief”) rather than embodying them mid-dance. Micro-choices—rolling the dice, selecting the next pirouette—are present, yet the stakes of failure never graze her body or breath; cost is announced, not felt. The final whispered verse lands as earned renunciation, but the arc flirts with perfection rather than flaw-driven inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s lantern-lighter vocation gives her a believable eye for fissures, and her decision to pour out ritual coffee is a concrete, value-revealing micro-choice. The recovered wildflowers embody a credible cost: her trembling hands and the knowledge that “nothing about her lantern lighting would ever feel routine.” Interiority stays specific (“vibration in the marrow”) and avoids label-speak. Only minor flaw: the sister’s disappearance is referenced, not dramatized, so the emotional contradiction remains one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically sustained but remains at one emotional pitch; no contradictory impulse challenges her serene resolve, so the arc is static. The final “racing heart” is the first embodied contradiction, arriving too late to complicate her earlier poise. Motivation is clear yet monolithic; the absence of micro-choice undercuts earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority (“I don’t know how to interrogate the walls without seeming mad”) is concrete and stakes her social self-image; her decision to press her own seal beside Elias’s crystallizes her arc with visible cost—accepting spectral complicity. The contradiction between craving knowledge and fearing lunacy is held throughout, embodied in tactile micro-choices (fingertips on molding, pressing copper). Elias functions more as oracle than crucible; because his ghost-state is never tested or jeopardized, he supplies pressure without personal risk, capping this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s skeptical armor and grief-driven precision are vivid, but her interior contradiction—needing to archive the memory while fearing its loneliness—only surfaces in summary. The final shift from compulsion to choice is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice in-scene costs her anything visible. Skepticism remains intellectual posture; we never feel it fail in her body under the garden’s shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. duty, blood vs. ink—are dramatized in vivo as she pierces and re-pierces herself to thicken pigment; the final renunciation (severing her authorship from the document) is earned by seven years of drip-measured patience. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0: the grandmother rose quote is slightly too on-the-nose, diluting the private cost into aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—grief for her sister vs. duty to the Archivists—are dramatized in the shell-raising beat; the final choice to “sing her sister home” costs her the clean absolution she sought, fulfilling the 9+ test. Interiority stays concrete (“reed-blown melancholy,” “teeth rather than heard”). One label-slip—“she understood at last”—is cushioned by immediate embodied action, so only a hairline dip.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her breath misting in starlight, her fingers on warped glass—yet her contradictory impulses (exposure vs protection, truth vs fracture) are summarized rather than dramatized in real time. The cost of “weaving truth carefully” is asserted, not felt: we never see her momentarily overload a dreamer or feel her own mind crack. The captain’s flicker is a fine external mirror, but her decisive promise to write the truth arrives without an on-page micro-choice that shows the price she will personally pay. Still, her perceptual signature remains consistent and atmospheric, keeping her above the generic “wreck-diver” label.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and character-specific: the bamboo whisk as “conduit for breath,” the net’s tear felt before seen. Her contradictory impulse—mending while acknowledging impermanence—remains active in every knot. The final renunciation (leaving the parapet satisfied without witness) carries visible cost: she accepts that her repair is itself transient. No stock interiority; every beat is filtered through her idiosyncratic philosophy of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s skeptical drive is vivid from the first line, and her refusal to accept “comforting myths” propels every action. The contradiction between her contempt for superstition and her growing protectiveness toward the settlers gives her interior friction that peaks when she must persuade the very people she has unmasked. Micro-choices—tweezer-reassembling letters while her fingers blister—embody the cost of truth. The only slack is the off-stage settlers, who remain a fearful chorus rather than individuals who could pressure her status.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—mushroom-beard as willed sterility rebellion, “hunger of a variant allegiance,” locksmith self-image—yet the final fork-in-time is asserted more than dramatized. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the moment he “whispered back” lacks micro-choice cost. Still, the psyche is singular, consistent, and the loneliness is embodied in every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—archive vs. deliver, hoard vs. bridge—are embodied in the micro-choice to open the three jars and record the new hybrid sound; the cost of leaving the loft is felt. Interiority stays concrete, rooted in tactile memory of sand-choked gears and salt air. The final renunciation (no longer “speak in the wrong language of absence”) is earned by the causality of the dawn experiment. Hairline slip: “positively wistful joy that stung like honey” drifts toward label-speak mid-cry.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s “logically emotional” duality is dramatized in every beat: she calculates beam angles while feeling the key’s second heartbeat, rigs a sonic defense that fuses math and memory, then collapses with palpable cost. The final song is earned—her ten-year detachment and grief compress into one exact note that dissolves hunters and leaves her trembling, foreclosing any return to pure detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her breath crystallizing, her moccasins silent, her horizon map folded against her chest. The contradiction between her “restrained wildness” and the consortium’s brutal pace is embodied, not labeled. The seven-year wait is dramatized through the vigil of tracking moon paths, and the final crossing costs her the sanctuary itself—an earned stasis with visible price. Only the hint of “diamond-edged tool” flirts with over-articulation, but it is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—empirical detachment vs. grief—are dramatized in the tunnel; her micro-choice to photograph rust while trembling shows embodied cost. The final decision to write the report *her* way is earned by the lantern-weight image, severing Elias’s grip with visible price. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Flaw: “fortified vulnerability” is named, not shown in body until late.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s guilt and need for atonement are palpable, but the interiority tips into self-diagnostic labels (“he had failed Marcus once”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to hand over the heart is present, yet the story tells us the cost instead of letting his body betray it. Still, the hierarchy of values—ministry vs. justice—remains legible and drives the final oath.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kip’s steadily-curious interiority is concrete, specific, and drives every micro-adjustment; the arrow-tip snap-off as tuning-fork/clapper is a perfect crystallization of trait-as-tool. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ gate fails, but the single-POV endurance is vivid and the final laugh carries earned stasis cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s obsession with “where deleted files go” is vivid and specific, but her interiority slips into editorial summary (“she finally understood…”) instead of dramatized contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice visibly hurts her until the final broadcast, so the cost feels retrospective rather than earned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s calm intuition is embodied in micro-choices—angling mirrors, letting the fragment warm—so her final refusal of the binary is credible. The shadow-coat reacting to danger is a vivid, continuous externalization of interiority. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only stated; she never visibly wavers, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Closure is earned, but the absence of a moment where she almost chooses sacrifice keeps her just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“the ice had shifted inside her”), but the final beat of release is declared rather than dramatized through a visible choice; the appointment still waits in the pocket with no overt act to counter or embrace it, so the cost feels inferred, not paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—clinging to the vineyard’s permanence while reckoning with Marcus’s nomad yeast—surfaces in concrete gestures: pocketing the charred letter, smoothing its brittle edge against her palm, pressing hand to earth at the close. The shift from refusal to acceptance is embodied, not declared; her final micro-choice (prepare winter mulching while carrying the fragment) shows a hardened hierarchy of values. Yet the epiphany still leans on an articulated thesis (“their separation was not a failure of love but its maturation”), slightly over-calibrating the emotional arithmetic and keeping her just shy of full 9-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-walker’s motivation—to “preserve the echo of wisdom”—is clear, embodied, and escalates through micro-choices (spiral approach, mask removal, song). Her contradictory impulses (vulnerability vs. theft from the desert) play out in scene, culminating in a cost-paid renunciation. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “her bare face felt the cool air.”

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s calm curator persona is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why she stays, what the “masterpiece” costs her—never crystallizes in a single pressured choice; the final exit reads as scheduled rather than renounced. No moment forces her to risk or surrender anything tangible, so the arc is observational, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s reticence and preservative drive are consistent, but interiority stays abstract—“weathered innocence” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final placement of the crystal feels inevitable rather than a hard choice that costs her something we can feel. Micro-choices (pressing crystal to spine, raising it to lips) are atmospheric, not tactical. Meets baseline for arc but lacks the visible cost or internal split needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to trap time while cursed to forget—is vivid, but the looped “tidal longing” refrain abstracts emotion into performance. His single micro-choice (chalk on stone) is dramatized, yet the forgetting resets him to the same blank each cycle; no new tactic or escalating misjudgment is attempted, so the arc is circular rather than textured by compounding error. The cost is felt only as vibration in his sternum, a generalized ache rather than a concrete forfeiture that reorders options. Characterization is memorable but flattened by recursive stasis; no interior tilt changes the next pass.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocational obsession with “the ephemeral” supplies a clear through-line; her refusal to evacuate is rooted in decades of embodied practice. Interiority stays concrete—fingers stained with chemicals, the hush of a falling leaf—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation (trapping infinity by letting it go) is earned via the leaf-audio beat that re-orders the clock, so cost is visible. Minor slip: the leap from acoustic memory to cosmic stabilization feels near-mystical, skirting causality edge.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her decisive micro-choice to take the vinyl shard anchors agency. The final image of Maya pressing the broken record to her heart shows embodied, contradictory emotion. Yet Elena’s own stakes feel instrumental rather than personally costly; the hymn never endangers her professional serenity, so the closure cost is vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s obsession is concrete—she counts heartbeats against the key—and her final recognition that the seals were mercy, not punishment, is earned by the looping walk. Yet her interiority rarely contradicts itself; the prose tells “singular obsession” instead of showing competing impulses in the moment. The cost is felt (she now shoulders an open-ended task), but the emotional contradiction that would make her feel fully alive under pressure stays off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—rationalist healer vs. newly minted believer—registers in concrete micro-choices (splinting radius, surrendering the tooth) rather than summary. The changeling’s “shrewdly innocent” mask cracks only once; more embodied contradiction on her side would lift the score. The final gesture of handing back the tooth lands as earned renunciation with visible cost to both.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is lyrically specific, but the “star-fire”/“zephyr bloom” idiom drifts toward cosmic boilerplate; embodied contradiction is implied yet never crystallizes in a single forced micro-choice. The final kneel registers as emblematic acquiescence rather than a fresh, costly stance. Still, the seven-year patience and the refusal of flame keep motivation coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—public shame vs. private nurturance—are alive in every beat; the pendant renunciation is earned by the prior 700 words of measured micro-choices. Interiority stays concrete (“humidity muffled the echoes of her digital ghost”) and never slips into diagnostic labels. The only keep-it-from-9.0 slip: a hair of safety-hedging—her flaws are named but never allowed to complicate the final act, so the cost feels pristine rather than dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically sketched but never embodied under pressure; her “trembling hand” is the only corporeal cue. Micro-choices (inserting herself into reflections) are summarized, not dramatized, so the renunciation feels announced rather than earned. Contradictory impulses (“end” vs “collect”) stay abstract; we see no moment where one defeats the other with cost. The closure therefore lands as poetic declaration, not earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s tinkerer identity is embodied through axle-grease fingers and chronometer work, but the interior contradiction between whimsical inventor and priestess never collides under pressure; the shift from gears to song is declared rather than dramatized with felt cost. The final restoration is moving yet leaves her personal stake unchanged—no tool forfeited, no belief shaken—so the change reads as communal, not character-deep. Still, her micro-choices (uncoiling the vine, humming until voice clears) keep agency visible and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—“her breath freezing in crystalline plumes…listening to the cartography of blood.” Contradictory impulses pulse: explosive alchemist forced into glacial patience. Micro-choices—placing each scrap, tilting the final drop—reveal her hierarchy of values with visible frost-bite cost. The earned stasis (she will stay frozen, map in hand) is fully motivated by the prior因果ity of pulse-to-path translation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with quantum-quartz acoustics is under-typed yet embodied every time his fingers test a tooth; the trembling mainspring wind crystallizes a believable cost. Interiority avoids label-speak, keeps locksmith craft in muscle memory (32° angle, dawn tally). Only lapse: 9-day montage remains summary, so we glimpse no mid-process micro-choice that visibly tightens stakes; this caps the arc short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—architect of endless recursion yet desperate to calcify form—shows in her tender, tactile reading of calcified grief, but the text never lets her decision to keep harvesting burdens cost her anything; her stance is static, the micro-choice to finish the count is only a ritual reset, so the arc plateaus rather than crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her calloused thumb on the carved grooves, the weight of ash in her palms. The contradiction between grief’s vertigo and the chisel’s steady bite is held in scene, not summarized. Micro-choices (silencing the kettle, aligning the blank with skylight light) externalize the “harvesting lessons” motive. Loss of 0.3 because the lions remain off-page memory; their absence is told more than dramatized, muting the crucible effect that could have forced a costlier visible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s eroded ambition and contradictory need to hoard then surrender regret are embodied in every micro-choice; the moment she opens her mouth and “let the years pour out” crystallizes a lifetime of internal conflict with visible cost, earning the trade with her ghost. The scavenger identity is more label than lived-in trade—no concrete scavenging tactics appear—so motivation borders on emblematic, not individuated, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s engineering eye and quiet refusal to surrender a dead place are embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling to trace cracks, pocketing the sextant, rerouting pumps at night. The final decision to stay and plant is the cumulative payoff of those choices, felt as personal cost rather than abstract victory. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One flaw: the “equations for hope” line edges toward thesis, not lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and specific—clockwork fingers, metronome-heart—but the decisive surrender is gestured rather than dramatized: we are told seventeen years of regret yet see only one static kneel. The contradiction between clinging to safety and releasing the dream is asserted, not enacted in a micro-choice that costs her something visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s contradictory impulse—hunger for truth versus loyalty to mentor—stays active in-scene; each false map physically handled and cursed. The final renunciation of “seeking” is earned by every prior misnavigation, cost felt in the dawn dust. Interiority is concrete (“boots sinking into mud that smelled of rotting lilies and iron”) not label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy—sundial angle over broken compass—crystallizes values without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “infinitely patient” stance is more posture than contradiction; we get no interior fracture under pressure. The embodied emotion is strong—the glass warming, knees creaking—but the final “seed” is accepted without visible refusal or cost to him. Interiority is vivid, yet the fisherman remains a cipher, so the relationship crucible is muted. The characterization stops just short of the 9-band because the closure choice is memorization, not a renunciation that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—ritual preservation vs. letting-go—are dramatized in the finger-blanching thread test and the projection ritual; the final bracelet choice costs him the comfort of denial, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete and biased; no therapeutic self-labeling. Slight dip: Duchess remains a perfume-and-silhouette absence rather than a pressure that forces a new micro-choice mid-scene; she never surprises him, so the crucible is only one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s contradictory mix of scientific detachment and desperate hope is embodied throughout (trembling hands, tears hissing on coils); his final stance is earned. The “bitterly sweet” refrain is lived, not labeled. No secondary characters on page, so relationship bullets skipped. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy (egg over safety, beauty over certainty) is visible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fire-claimed flesh,” “phantom pain”); the contradiction of firefighter/arson-daughter is always on.  Yet the decisive graft choice is driven by abstract hope (“teach her body to sing”) rather than a concrete, immediate cost or risk that narrows her options in-scene, so the final turn feels slightly under-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s luminous-skeptic trait is dramatized through her tactile interaction with the box and her refusal to accept the city’s plaque-history; her final thumb-press choice is rooted in that established mindset with visible cost (she must let the geese leave and the memories stay). Interiority stays embodied (“doubt radiating … as a searching light,” “thumb against the specific star”) rather than label-heavy. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is consistently embodied and particular—her “translucent hands,” the gear’s “brass teeth biting vacuum,” her gradual dispersal into luminescence—yet the final renunciation (she “press[es] the gear into the nebula’s heart”) is so lyrically compressed that the exact cost she pays (identity? agency? memory?) is felt but not sharply dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is voiced as thoughtful and meditative, but interiority drifts into poetic abstraction (“geometry of shared mourning”) that reads like narrative voice, not his. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene; the poem recitations are ritual, not dilemma. The final tying of ribbon to four stones is a symbolic act, yet its cost (a choice forgone or risk taken) is not dramatized on his body or calendar. Grand-mother is only spectral presence; relationship pressure therefore inert.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s forty-year debt ledger carved into a rake handle gives every micro-turn a visible cost; the final screw-turn feels earned because each inscription has foreshadowed the math of absolution. Interiority stays concrete—“splintered wood pressing against his ribs like a penance”—rather than abstract guilt. The only slack is the off-stage townspeople; their absence keeps relationship pressure theoretical, capping the emotional crucible just short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s solitary POV is vivid: her tactile intimacy with thorns, the ladder “memorised in dreams,” the recursive hum that threads her lineage. Interior contradiction is light—she wants answers yet savors solitude—but embodied emotion (soil under nails, heart quickening at weave) keeps her credible. The final renunciation—folding the tapestry back into the case—lands as earned stasis: she accepts the circular burden of tending echoes. Missing only a sharper cost on the page (tremor, hesitation) to breach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—dread of the limit vs. compulsion to map—stays concrete through tactile micro-choices (rolling the quill, hovering nib). The earned renunciation of unlimited prophecy is visible in the final paragraph’s “blank page filled but not closed,” paying the cost of restraint. Flaw: occasional diagnostic self-label (“groundedly imaginative”) rather than dramatized proof knocks 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s luminous mind and his vow to “teach dust to tell stories” give him a clear, escalating motive; the interior contradiction between secrecy and compulsion is felt. Yet the absence of on-page opposition or relationship pressure keeps the crucible cooler than publish-now perfection demands—no second character tests him, so the cost stays largely aesthetic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s grief-driven alchemy is visceral and embodied; the ash-scattering beats show micro-choices that visibly cost (mask cuts, breath restriction). Interiority stays specific to his perceptual world (“charcoal powder clung…black and irreducible”). The final renunciation—leaving the mask on the empty chair—earns its charge because every prior shard carried her rage. Only one POV on stage, so relationship/status bullets N/A; no convergence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rational rebel vs. myth-maker—remains vivid and embodied; the cog discovery forces an immediate, costly micro-choice to hide and rebuild. The final “quiet click” crystallizes Earned Stasis: he accepts exile from the healing myth, cost legible in the rising flood he refuses to flee. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; backstay reflections are anchored to present tactile cues and tilt his stance. Flaw: occasional diagnostic label (“wannabe philosopher”) used as self-description mid-scene rather than dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingers “tracing the rosette with expectantly resigned reverence” shows embodied contradiction. The three students remain typed by occupation/trauma label; only the miner’s daughter gets a micro-choice (omitting sharp notes) that visibly costs. Shared “traveled stillness” is asserted, not dramatized, so the ensemble shift feels lightweight. Closure earns a 7+ because the collective renunciation of noise is anchored in prior causality, even if secondary voices blur.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s synaptic “pruning” is a vivid embodied action that externalizes internal stakes; the memory-tasting gift is shown rather than told through concrete gustatory flashbacks. The final stance—offering the fruit to the regime—crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost (her emptied mind). Interior contradiction is present but remains a single-track arc; no secondary character pressure tested. Still, the earned renunciation lands clean under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s involuntary truth-telling is more label than lived contradiction; it never forces a costly micro-choice on the page. The only tangible cost is the Corporation’s displeasure, kept abstract. Interiority is evocative (“honey too thick to swallow”) yet drifts toward poetic self-exposition rather than embodied tension under pressure. Closure—handing the truth to the engineer—carries conceptual, not dramatized, cost; Earned Stasis is legible but not textured by prior on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is vividly shown through tactile micro-choices—fingers on driftwood, kneeling at the foundation—yet interior contradiction is thin; she never hesitates or fears the aliveness she uncovers. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat exposes a personal cost or risk to her. Still, her embodied perception and the orris-root micro-choices keep her above the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Corvin’s contradictory impulses—statue-still duty vs. trembling doubt—play out in-scene through the foxglove ampoule crush; the cost of trading certainty for “polyculture of maybe” is embodied in his calcified fingers bleeding purple smoke. Interiority stays granite-hard yet porous, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation of absolutes is earned by the prior cascade of micro-choices and pays visible price: the dome breathes but no longer shelters him from pressure. Character arc and theme are inseparable, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s grim optimism is dramatized through bleeding fingernails, whispered taunts to the architecture, and the micro-choice to inscribe proofs mid-climb; the contradictions play out in scene rather than label. Motivation stays anchored to the tactile memory of the brass-handle door, and her final refusal-to-observe costs her the perpetual staircase she has been feeding with attention. Interiority is concrete and particular until the penultimate paragraph, where a brief burst of diagnostic-speak (“perfection was a myth…”) momentarily abstracts the embodied state, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” stance are concrete and embodied; every brush-stroke is a micro-choice that costs her wakefulness and sanity. The final renunciation—she stops, dawn arrives, glyphs hover—earns its hush because the text has hollowed her out on-page. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene (only in lyrical summary), so the interior conflict never quite sparks under pressure. Still, the visible fatigue and the brush’s glow suffice to show a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s shift from detached curator to active archivist is legible: the opera-glass beat shows micro-choice under pressure, and her all-night transcription carries cost. Interiority is lush but occasionally drifts into curatorial rhetoric (“seventeen dying arts”) that reports rather than embodies. The final endurance is earned, yet the story never lets us overhear her voice in honest contradiction; the shift feels curated, not cracked. Still, the hierarchy of values—heritage over personal safety—surfaces in action and justifies the score.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s monomaniacal drive to unpick destiny is rendered through tactile micro-choices—winding counter-clockwise, fitting stone to axle. The contradiction between terror of death and exhilaration of erasure is kept active in scene, culminating in the costly renunciation of linear existence. Interiority occasionally drifts toward grand abstraction (“the tyranny of having one”), trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—guilt over matricide and self-orchestrated drowning—drives every beat; the final renunciation of the clasp lands with embodied cost. Micro-choices (locking doors, confessing, pressing clasp to mirror) are legible and escalate under dream-logic. Only minor slip: “morbid artistic precision” is diagnostic label-speak amid otherwise visceral emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prophet’s obsession is palpable, her body and tool fused into a single instrument; the 17-year backstory is concisely anchored to present action. No competing on-page characters, so status/relationship crucibles don’t apply. Interiority is sensory and concrete (“salt-stained fist,” “music of the waves made sleep impossible”). The final renunciation—storm acknowledged as collaborator—carries visible cost in the fading sky-glow, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “quietly driven” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing grooves, trembling fingers, re-lifting the whistle—so the interior pressure feels earned. The final renunciation (map-maker steps into the map) carries visible cost: she forfeits the safety of observation. One slip: the transcendence of the lost twelve is told, not embodied, so the emotional price is slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her gloved hands, the fingertip on the vine-work—but the “emotionally rational” label is asserted more than dramatized; we see her decide, not feel the cost in body. The micro-choice to frame Ashford’s love rather than condemn is sharp and stakes her reputation, yet the prior three-year wait is summarized, not lived, so the flaw/cost feels administratively rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—mapping lost dreams—remains consistent and embodied through tactile micro-choices (inkwell, epoxy, silt-brushing). Interiority is concrete, but the single-POV isolation means no relationship crucible; the only pressure is environmental. The final “quiet triumph” is credible as Earned Stasis, yet the absence of a second on-page character caps depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s profession as meticulous indexer is matter-of-factly shown and explains his focus on the stamp’s impressions; the final realization that “truth could be fragmented” converts his earlier quiet competence into a meaningful choice to remap the catalog. One micro-choice—pressing the stamp into his notebook—rides home the new conviction, so the arc earns its Charged Poise. Interiority drifts toward the abstract at times (“divergent timelines,” “parallel validities”), softening embodiment, but not enough to break credibility. Overall, a disciplined, if slightly cerebral, character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to grief while forging release—are dramatized through the physical folding of gems; the final dispersal costs her corporeal self, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete, never abstracting into therapy-speak. The lantern-maker identity is more backstory than on-page pressure, but her micro-choices under escalating loss feel individual and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Amara’s grief is vivid in the body (geode squeezed “against her palm”), but the interiority drifts into abstract theory-speak (“mathematics of loss”) that blunts contradiction under pressure; the final micro-choice—fracture the geode to carry the data—costs the stone but not visibly her, so the renunciation feels partial.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s lifelong search and bodily tremor give credible yearning; the final moment of felt acceptance lands as earned stasis under the accumulative lens. Interiority stays concrete—"resonate deep in his teeth and sternum"—though the congenital "perpetually surprised" face is only asserted, never exploited for contradiction or cost. One micro-choice—inserting the chip—drives the climax; motivation holds steady. Still, no secondary pressure or relationship crucible is possible in the single-character frame, so the arc, while coherent, lacks the layered friction needed for the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt is palpably embodied in salt-raw hands and the stopped watch; his micro-choice to arrange the carvings rather than flee crystallizes a hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead filtering remorse through tactile detail. The final renunciation—bearing witness instead of seeking absolution—earns its cost via the prior causal chain of erasure and recovery. Flaw: the decision to “find the daughter tomorrow” is declared, not dramatized, softening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The negotiator’s interiority is concrete—counting seconds, warming the key against her ribs—and her gesture of handing the drawer pull to the scout crystallizes a value hierarchy. Yet the moment of “untethering” is stated more than embodied; we see no micro-choice that visibly costs her. Still, the brass token’s transfer anchors a believable shift from retribution to restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“salt spray kissed,” “compass heavy”); regret and self-loathing pulse in every beat. The renunciation of celestial navigation for the “humming infrastructure of regret” is a credible, earned stance shift with visible cost—the compass left on the rock. Minor over-articulation (“broken things could still cast light”) barely hedges the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—killer muscle-memory versus hunger for empathy—are dramatized in embodied beats (twitching finger, knees buckling under borrowed grief). The final surrender to feeling is earned by the cumulative failures inside the maze. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude. A hairline slip: “weapon it had been” edges toward abstraction, but the cost is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for reunion yet flinching from self-erasure—is dramatized in her unsteady pulse against steady hands; the final “expansion” choice carries visible cost as her flesh turns starlight, anchoring her forever in the grove.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory wants—recover lost cartomancy time vs surrender to its transformation—are kept in simultaneous tension; every micro-choice (tracing the absence of her daughter’s future hands, pressing blood into the saucer crack) externalizes the split. The final renunciation is earned: she pays with the literal opening of memory and the pocket-stone of forgiven time. No stock interiority; even her perplexity is enacted, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—pacifist who must literally pierce reality—is dramatized in every micro-choice (threading the tear, ascending). The final weightlessness is earned by the decades-long meditation sequence shown in reflection. No safety-hedging: his violence-to-peace arc keeps its moral ambiguity. Only cap: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—poverty as freedom, giving as keeping—are present but stay largely abstract; the embodied cost arrives only in the final ash fall, so renunciation feels more asserted than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's calmly inventive precision under pressure is shown through tactile micro-choices (counting steps, aligning quill holder, painting by touch); the interior contradiction between loyal sentinel and silent insurrectionist is dramatized in the moment she re-keys the sundial, foreclosing her old identity with felt cost. Motivation grows from abstract resistance to concrete spatial sabotage, but the emotional price (loss of belonging, perpetual secrecy) is implied rather than embodied on the page. Still, the single-POV lens stays tight, and every action is traceable to her calculated risk.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    The eel herder’s vow to the astronomer anchors every micro-choice; his interiority stays concrete (“futures unfolded…burning”) and the final dispersal costs his very self. No secondary characters appear, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“His curse arrived unbidden”) mid-beat. Earned renunciation lands with visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test for single-POV.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction is strong—silence as both weapon and wound—but the final “voice” feels foregone; the micro-choice to re-hide the envelope is the only beat where cost is visible. Earlier beats summarize endurance rather than dramatize compounding risk. Still, the lineage scar motif keeps motivation legible and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric’s mechanical arm, needle card, and duel with Silas together dramatize his credo that “questions can become maps.” The contradiction—fighting a friend to decode an invitation—gives him texture and cost, yet the interiority never tips into diagnostic speak. Micro-choices (aligning needles with shadow lines) fuse motive and action; the final gift of the needle to Silas crystallizes the changed relationship. Only the off-page loss of flesh is asserted, not embodied, keeping this just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “molting” trait is stated repeatedly but never alters on-page tactics; the fear of forgetting is announced, not dramatized. His single micro-choice—sliding the tin—rests on Marcus, not on any contradiction inside himself. Marcus’s stoic reply supplies the beat’s only felt cost. Interiority drifts into lyric summary (“luminous fracture”) instead of embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s loss-driven persistence is embodied in every micro-choice (tuning the metronome to failing compasses, threading the reel). The film-Maya device externalizes memory so grief becomes navigable, giving concrete stakes to each keystroke. The final tempered “peace” is earned because the entire arpeggio sequence literalizes her refusal to surrender Maya’s coordinates. Only minor slip: “strategically creative” is named once rather than shown through contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. luminous doubt—drives every beat; the “empirically whimsical” stance is embodied in tactile choices (spectrographic dream notes, modulated singing) and culminates in the costly renunciation of certainty at the end. Micro-choices (placing the seed, singing at frequencies, touching the bark) all flow from her motive to protect memory while accepting potential corruption; the final image of unripe future memories makes the cost visible. No headcount issues; single-POV discipline holds. Just shy of 9+ because the grandmother apparition, while moving, is the only moment that flirts with convenient epiphany rather than earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s slow-spoken, tidal interiority is consistent and embodied; the pruning micro-choices visibly enact her need for release, and the final “forgiveness” stance is earned through the compass-and-lace causality. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—reflection dominates action—so the arc stays just shy of 9+ eruption.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s motivation—to strip drama from existence—is consistent, embodied in her scientific past and present attention to dust patterns. Her internal conflict (desire for control vs. surrender to entropy) is shown through micro-choices: not cleaning the butterfly dust, cataloging with attention instead of equations. The flaw of diagnostic self-awareness (“she preprocesses reality”) slightly flattens emotional authenticity, but her transformation feels earned through sustained observation rather than epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, guilt, and slow recalibration feel authentic, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (kneeling to read frost, refusing to rush) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in trauma. The shift from self-destruction to purposeful reassembly is earned through tactile engagement with the landscape and her father’s hidden legacy. No therapy-speak; emotion arises through action, silence, and precise sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, anger, and hope manifest through tactile sensation and thermal perception rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (controlled breathing, deliberate gestures) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma, and her final act of composition constitutes a credible endurance that forecloses passive victimhood with visible emotional cost. The brother’s off-page presence functions as backstory, not active pressure, but Mara’s motivation remains internally coherent and intensifies without sentimentality. The only flaw: minor over-articulation in “fractured heart” risks therapy-speak, though it’s swiftly grounded in thermal imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marian’s inadvertently stubborn nature isn’t just stated—it actively shapes her resistance, then fuels her resolve to defy the ocean’s logic. Her motivation (“to give rest a permanent address”) is embodied in every choice, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses her old life with visible cost: she becomes the librarian of the drowned dead. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, weariness, throbbing behind the eyes, and sternum-vibrating distress signals render emotion physically. The final renunciation—sleeping among the stacks—is earned by thirty years of burial work now transcended.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and consistent, her motivation rooted in intergenerational care and quiet resistance. Her micro-choices—leaving insulin in a specific pot, refusing credit—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The child’s appearance catalyzes a credible evolution from anonymity to visibility, earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation is vividly rooted in spiritual curiosity and ancestral grief, with embodied emotion (trembling, breath patterns) and micro-choices (positioning the camera, pressing the tear to stone) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The 1847 nurse backstory is concretely anchored to present stimuli and alters her final action. However, the internal contradiction between holding on and letting go is stated more than dramatized in simultaneous tension—leaning toward epiphany over struggle. The closure renunciation is earned, but the emotional arc lacks a visible misstep or blind spot that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to map the texture of time—is deeply interwoven with his profession and perception, and his internal conflict between memory and presence is rendered through embodied, sensory language. His final dissolution feels earned by his obsessive pursuit and retrocognitive entrapment. However, his emotional arc lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; he moves steadily toward transcendence without resisting or doubting it, flattening interior tension. The absence of another character limits relational crucible but doesn’t harm this single-POV design.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—preservation over freedom—is crystallized in her voluntary chain and culminates in her immovable stance, a renunciation that forecloses escape with visible cost. Her internal contradiction (liberator who stays chained) manifests physically and morally without diagnostic self-awareness. The scavenger’s hesitation validates her strategy, proving her patience is tactical, not passive. Every micro-choice—from retrieving the arrow to aligning the fletching—reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in ecological stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is rooted in a specific, haunting betrayal and intensifies through embodied choices (e.g., activating the forge despite her failing body). Her synesthesia and profession inform her perception without veering into diagnostic self-awareness. The final act of fitting the device into her own ear is a renunciation that forecloses healing but affirms witness, with visible cost in her dying cells. Contradictory impulses—desire for truth vs. burden of regret—act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—collecting “illuminated moments”—is consistent, poetic, and tied to her actions, yet lacks internal contradiction in scene. Her micro-choices (interpreting flowers, timing the theft) reveal hierarchy of values, but emotional embodiment leans lyrical over visceral. The final act of listening to the portrait shows yearning, not conflict, softening the cost. Still, her quietly savvy trait shapes tactics credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    The glassblower’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile rituals, emotional contradictions (solitude vs. ceremony), and micro-choices (narrating tea-making, embedding the bookmark) reveal a coherent psyche under pressure. Her motivation—to craft “transparent shelters” for inquiry—is consistent with her profession and temperament. The final act of abandonment carries visible cost: she leaves behind her creations, accepting impermanence. No diagnostic label-speak; her “thoughtfully spirited” trait manifests through action, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kai’s interiority is vividly embodied—tremors, acrophobia, and hyper-awareness aren’t labels but lived mechanics that drive micro-choices (e.g., using rusted weak points). Their contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) act simultaneously, not alternately. The final confrontation reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, autonomy over legacy. No diagnostic self-awareness; emotional degradation under stress feels authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oracle’s “mild obsession” is concretely embodied through micro-choices—arranging pebbles, pressing gold leaf to skin—and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering silence as tactile, viscous, or sharp. Her final renunciation (becoming the map) is earned by seventeen years of cataloging, with visible cost: the booklet’s disintegration and her voice’s extinction. No secondary characters dilute focus; her solitude intensifies the stakes. The only flaw: slight emotional flatness in the climax, where transformation borders on abstraction without bodily consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Seven’s internal contradiction—janitor vs. violinist, sweeper vs. seeker—is rendered with precise, embodied tension. Its micro-choices (touching the violin, choosing to play) emerge from consistent traits and escalate meaningfully. The final renunciation of forgiveness for origins feels earned, not declared, and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and quantum resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her moral conflict over complicity, loyalty, and truth emerges through tactile choices (clutching tickets, returning the lens) rather than diagnostic self-analysis. Julian’s desperation reads as human, not contrived, and their mutual vulnerability crystallizes in micro-choices that carry relational cost. The final decision to confess isn’t tidy but weighted by prior silence, making the earned reconfiguration feel inevitable yet costly. No emotional summarization; contradiction thrums beneath every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—proving gardens know their gardeners—is embodied through micro-choices like placing specific marbles and speaking remembered lies, revealing a hierarchy of values where truth is secondary to negotiated care. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting in tactile rituals and contradictions (e.g., deception as scaffolding). The final renunciation—emptying her pouch—earns closure through prior causality, with visible cost in the garden’s dual-state response. No safety-hedging: her pragmatism carries moral weight without artificial balance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—to prove time moves sideways—is rooted in personal obsession, not abstract curiosity, and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., initiating the sequence despite skepticism). His interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are embodied (“icy warmth spread through his chest”). However, his flaw (stubborn idealism) lacks a visible misstep that compounds before resolution—his success arrives cleanly, slightly undercutting the “genuine struggle” criterion. The final renunciation of doubt is earned, but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—driven by dreams and an intuitive pull toward a ghostly code—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits (her cellist’s instinct, tactile engagement with decay). Her internal conflict between scholarly documentation and creative compulsion manifests simultaneously in micro-choices: tracing stains, repositioning lanterns, playing unwritten notes. The final act of leaving the program to dissolve is a credible renunciation with visible cost: surrendering the artifact that bridged her to Vane. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her fever-addled perception, professional guilt, and moral reckoning feel embodied, not diagnostic. Her contradiction (oracle trained in fault tolerance vs. complicity in climate denial) drives every micro-choice. The final act—taping the illustration at the center—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the loss of self-deception. No therapy-speak; emotion bleeds through tactile detail (smudging ink, trembling fingers).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her drowsy alertness, skepticism, and moral reckoning cohere through precise physical reactions (trembling flashlight, tracing beads) and micro-choices (photographing the valve). Her motivation—to weigh Elias’s swallowed truth—emerges from consistent traits and intensifies without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of supernatural comfort in favor of bearing witness is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost. No head-hopping or diagnostic label-speak undermines her flawed, credible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—witnessing change without judgment—is consistent and embodied through her tactile interaction with the swan, the library, and the obsidian refuge. Her internal conflict between preservation and transformation is subtly rendered, though her emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice that alters tactics under pressure. The final act of folding the swan anew shows agency, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic abstraction (“gripping reality loosely”) without sufficient grounding in bodily contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied through her “softly adaptive” playing and restrained joy, while Milo’s trauma manifests in physical tension and silence. The baby hair curl functions as a tactile bridge that reveals their shared vulnerability. However, Milo’s internal shift lacks contradictory impulses—his breakthrough feels linear rather than wrestled from competing fears. The final word “Again” is earned, but the absence of visible struggle slightly undercuts the cost of his re-engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—collecting stories walls have heard—is deeply rooted in her biological sensitivity and the world’s loss of dreams, compelling high-stakes choices like probing scorched diaries and interpreting the tapestry. Her interiority is concrete (“tears falling on the dragon’s wing”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses (scholarly detachment vs. emotional vulnerability) act simultaneously during discovery. The final transcription and archival act constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost: she shoulders memory alone in a dreamless world.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his belief in accidental prophecy, his musical metaphors for transposition, and his unaware mastery all cohere into a singular, flawed consciousness. His micro-choices (writing specific fortunes, offering cookies to the stranger) reveal a hierarchy of values: connection over control, intuition over intel. The final renunciation—leaving the lighthouse—is earned by his accumulated unknowing agency, with the cost being the loss of his isolated sanctuary. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied through ritual action—his finger hovering over the pedal, tracing pigment—never lapsing into diagnostic abstraction. His contradiction (using sound to wield silence) manifests physically and philosophically under pressure. The final renunciation of force in favor of “clarity, muted and absolute” feels earned by every prior micro-choice. No safety-hedging: his competence is matched by genuine vulnerability to the entity’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied and particular, especially in his tactile engagement with the nautilus shell and the ice’s resonance. His motivation—transcending the reductive fortune-writing of his past to access a deeper symphonic truth—is consistent and intensifies organically. The final choice to “conduct the dawn” feels earned through layered micro-choices (tracing memories, aligning shell chambers with landscape). However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“chronological homesickness”) without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene to fully satisfy the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, burning tablet, and gravity-defying stance convey emotional and existential tension without resorting to diagnostic label-speak. Her contradictory impulses (desire to escape vs. need to confront) manifest in concrete micro-choices: stepping into void, accepting the procedural path. The final renunciation—embracing her multiplicity—is earned through prior struggle, though the epiphany leans slightly toward conceptual neatness over visceral disarray.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her numbness as “gloves made of stone,” her grief as frequencies below panic—and her micro-choices (touching the drum, then the needle) reveal a hierarchy of values with escalating emotional cost. Her deafness isn’t just sensory loss but emotional armor, and Mathew’s presence pressures her without dominating her arc. The final renunciation of protective ice is earned through tactile discovery, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, profession-bound, and emotionally embodied—her trembling fingers, lateral movement, and ink-mixing reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation (integrity through solitude) is consistent and intensifies with stakes, culminating in a renunciation of safety for truth. The final choice is earned by prior causality: her observational discipline directly enables her to decode the pigeon’s message and recognize the quarantine’s failure. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (fear vs. duty) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his “aromatically cautious” breath, trembling hands, and grief-triggered tears feel specific and visceral, not diagnostic. His motivation (to understand scent-linked grief) drives every action and culminates in a credible, earned shift from fear to acceptance. The final choice—to inhale fully, weep openly—is rooted in seventeen years of avoidance and catalyzed by the vial’s discovery, with visible emotional cost. No therapy-speak; contradictions (caution vs. yearning) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his yearning for his lover’s voice versus his reverence for geological time—and his micro-choices (unlooping the rope, scraping sediment) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in ethical playfulness. His motivation to “discover the texture of time” is consistent and deepened by backstory that anchors present action. However, the final renunciation lacks a decisive internal struggle on the page; the choice feels more lyrical than wrestled, slightly undercutting the cost of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is embodied in every action, from collecting condensation to playing “the gaps between notes.” Her internal contradiction (desire to unbind silence vs. honoring incompleteness) manifests in real-time choices, not abstract reflection. The final renunciation—letting the note decay naturally—earns her stance with visible cost: she foregoes resolution, accepting the world’s brokenness as sufficient. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through tactile, acoustic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus yearning to fuse insight with empathy—are embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., admitting limitations while applying the compound). The client’s transformation forces Kael into a credible endurance that forecloses emotional safety, with visible cost in uncertainty (“though uncertainty colored the words”). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile detail (static, resin tears). Final renunciation of “shadows” is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—merchant pragmatism versus poetic generosity—is rendered with concrete, embodied detail (“boots heavy with the day's commerce,” “cautious exuberance”) and intensifies credibly through micro-choices (redirecting the envelope, reallocating contingency funds). His transformation is earned by prior causality, culminating in a renunciation of extractive brokerage with visible cost: he trades profit margins for patronage. Clara functions effectively as both catalyst and counterweight, though her interiority remains secondary to Elias’s arc, which fits the single-POV default. The flaw preventing a 9+ is slight emotional tidiness in his epiphany—compassion arrives cleanly, without messy self-deception or hypocrisy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—to graft oneself onto community—is viscerally embodied in their weeping at being witnessed and in the creation of reed structures for others. The mute artist’s emergence reframes Kael’s solitude as shared longing, making the final dedication feel earned. However, secondary characters like Mire and Joss remain underdeveloped archetypes ("names that tasted like honey and rust"), limiting relational depth. The “boldly sympathetic” trait is shown, not told, but lacks a contradictory impulse that would elevate interiority to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—documenting ephemeral phenomena and sculpting time—is deeply interwoven with her identity as an illustrator, driving every micro-choice. Her internal conflict between artistic ambition and temporal theft manifests in embodied tension (“fingers trembled… not with fear, but with the precise burden”). The final act of releasing borrowed time demonstrates earned renunciation with tangible cost: the giant stirs early, the pendant goes inert. Her flaw—stealing time—is not hedged; it carries moral weight and irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—grief fused with scientific yearning—is rendered through embodied ritual, not exposition. His contradictory impulses (to accept vs. to summon) act simultaneously in the climactic tracing of the mosaic. The glass eyes function as both emotional crutch and tool of perception, revealing his gently inventive nature under pressure. His final choice—to carry the answer in his chest rather than demand physical proof—earns closure with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation is deeply rooted in embodied memory and communal care, not abstract altruism. Her contradictory impulses—desire for invisibility versus yearning to be seen through her gifts—animate every micro-choice. The refrain “to become visible to those who need you” avoids diagnostic label-speak by manifesting in tactile acts: wrapping fragments, selecting recipients, retreating after. Her kindness and methodicalness are not traits but tactics with visible cost: exhaustion, isolation, the risk of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her rigidity, grief over wasted years, and dawning surrender feel earned, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (unclenching her hand, abandoning blueprints) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. The contradiction between her scientific control and yearning for authentic connection pulses through every beat. Her transformation avoids epiphanic neatness, rooted instead in tactile, embodied realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s insomnia, artistic compulsion, and wry earnestness cohere into a psychologically specific interiority. Her micro-choices—bartering kelp for the brooch, descending the sinkhole, sketching from memory—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preservation amid loss. The exchange with Maren crystallizes her arc: not healing, but vigilance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in squelching boots, trembling hands, and salt-eaten canvases.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—pride in foresight versus the terror of its failure—is embodied in tactile, sensory terms (“admission tasting like copper”) and culminates in a renunciation of control that feels earned. Her micro-choices (touching the wall, then the pearl) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from prediction to presence. The pilgrim’s layered voice and shadow-play function as pressure, not exposition, forcing Elara’s epiphany without convenient self-diagnosis. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion stays grounded in quartz, light, and pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s reactively visionary trait is embodied through tactile triggers and staggered perception, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His micro-choices—pressing the valve into the woman’s hands, resuming his work—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on communal meaning-making. The old woman’s transformation provides credible secondary pressure without flattening Kael’s interiority. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly softening the emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in grief, professional identity, and obsessive cartographic logic—is rendered with concrete interiority and embodied contradiction. Her “trembling certainty” captures the tension between analytical control and emotional vulnerability. Every micro-choice (e.g., aligning the punch with exact pressure) reveals her hierarchy of values. The final act of boarding is earned by seventeen years of mapping and eight of carrying silence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s skepticism and kindness are embodied through precise micro-choices—helping elderly astronomers, patiently managing disappointed children—and her internal contradiction (disbelief vs. empathy) intensifies credibly upon contact with the tile. The epiphany avoids therapy-speak by grounding transformation in tactile sensation (“burned cold, then warm”) and concrete action (redesigning the tower). Her final renunciation of detached empiricism carries visible cost: loss of intellectual safety for vulnerable openness. However, the shift from skeptic to guardian occurs with minimal struggle, slightly softening the arc’s rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—boredom calcified into a quest for the "threshold beyond goodbye"—is rooted in consistent, deeply felt traits and intensifies credibly through his handling of the amulet and navigation of the mutiny. His internal conflict between despair and anticipation is embodied in tactile detail (“amulet grew hot against his immortal skin”) rather than abstracted. The final choice—to love again, now understanding loss as a doorway—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: the shattering of the amulet and dissolution of his last tether to the past. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s internal contradiction—rigid honesty vs. necessary deception—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., dipping the needle, calculating the guard’s deviation) and anchored in her mathematical mindset. Her motivation intensifies credibly from moral discomfort to active complicity, with visible cost: sacrificing her “carefully guarded innocence.” The father remains off-page but exerts pressure through backstory that alters present tactics. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through action and perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve lost textures through invented histories—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (gilding, charting lamp hum) and charged with emotional specificity (his daughter’s laughter, the town’s silence). His internal conflict between memory and fabrication manifests as simultaneous impulses: restraint vs. urgency, preservation vs. invention. The final choice—sealing the last page—earns its weight through prior causality and carries visible cost: the exhaustion of his ritual, the fragility of what he’s built. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sensory detail and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s motivation—sensory hunger to reconstruct erased history—is rooted in consistent, embodied perception and drives every micro-choice. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile metaphors (“memories settled upon the skin like sediment”). The final renunciation of name in favor of layered identity is earned by prior accretion, with visible cost: a life lived in negative space. Contradictory impulses (desire for self vs. surrender to collective memory) act simultaneously in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her skepticism, grief, and longing manifest through tactile interactions with the shell and cello, not diagnostic labels. Her reimagining of past conversations reveals a core contradiction: intellectual rigidity versus emotional yearning. The final choice—to walk into the fog, relinquishing myth-busting for myth-making—is earned by her gradual surrender to resonance over reason. Cost is legible in her abandonment of the cello and former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s dual allegiance manifests as simultaneous, embodied contradiction—badge vs. tokens, corporate pragmatism vs. ancestral loyalty—without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (tagging walls, scoring glyphs with the stone chip) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The orderly intuitive trait directly shapes tactics with visible cost: she sacrifices personal neutrality to activate covert resistance. Final action resolves internal conflict not through epiphany but calibrated agency that serves both worlds without betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s motivation is vividly rooted in intergenerational legacy and scientific reverence, embodied through tactile actions (handling the sand grain, mixing reagents) rather than abstract sentiment. Her “purposefully curious” trait drives concrete choices with visible cost—enduring hypothermia, encoding data chemically—culminating in Earned Stasis: she witnesses but cannot prevent destruction. The closure choice feels inevitable, not imposed, and her internal contradiction (duty vs. futility) pulses beneath every action without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent: her blindness isn’t a label but a lived constraint shaping every micro-choice. Her motivation—penance for past failure—is dramatized through tactile urgency and the drone’s repair, not stated. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. grief, control vs. vulnerability) coexist in action, especially during recalibration. The final release of the drone earns closure through prior causality, with guilt transformed into purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlow’s dry-witted precision and subtly confident interiority are rendered through concrete micro-choices—thumbing the dog-eared phrasebook, muttering about hydrological inconvenience—that reveal his professional identity and emotional restraint. His motivation to map the unseeable feels rooted in temperament, not exposition, and his final act of transmission carries the quiet cost of irrevocably altering a hidden world. The internal contradiction between cartographic control and mythic surrender is embodied in his tactile engagement with condensation and ice. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a coherent, historically grounded flaw—merchant greed that deafened the city to warnings—and her actions embody a hard-won philosophy of reciprocity. Her “infinitely patient” trait isn’t merely stated but enacted through seventeen years of walking, with visible cost (no sleep, no hurry). The final dance accelerates not from whim but from detected dissonance, making her heightened pace a credible escalation under pressure. Her internal contradiction—between restoration and non-conquest—is sustained through embodied choices, not abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between survival instinct and the need to surrender—is rendered with visceral, embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices (exhaling air, drinking the vial) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief and curiosity. The final renunciation of self-preservation is earned through prior emotional groundwork tied to her sister. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in inherited shame and narrative self-invention, with interior contradictions—cunning masked as simplicity, fear of witness versus need for silence—driving every micro-choice. His final act of becoming a “ghost” feels earned through seven years of whispered lies into the stones, not imposed. The cost is palpable: renouncing return to the village, accepting permanent erasure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in tactile details like the myrrh-scented lattice and wind-teared prison grays.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Eira and Julian are vividly particularized through embodied contradiction: her “lovingly venomous” voice, his simultaneous weeping and laughter at the end. Motivations are rooted in ancestral trauma and karmic debt, not abstraction. Their micro-choices—Eira’s cameo appearances, Julian’s burial of the bead—carry visible cost and align with deep-seated flaws. The final renunciation (burying the bead) is earned by prior causality and forecloses Eira’s haunting, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s motivation is rooted in visceral, specific losses—tide pools choked with debris, the canyon as a “graveyard of good intentions”—and her actions consistently reflect her poetic, dream-guided nature. Her internal conflict between reverence for tradition and necessity of innovation manifests in embodied choices: bleeding fingers pressed to the plate, stitching stone with sea-foam thread. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of force, embracing “wandering grace” as salvation. Every micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values where patience outweighs control, with visible cost in blood and solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “warmly curious” touch on the sundial, her shiver of “genetic memory,” and the tension between reverence and caution feel specific and unforced. Her motivation—to restore lost faith through reconnection with ancestral remains—is dramatized through tactile, ritualistic action, not stated abstraction. The final prayer emerges organically from soil and bone, not borrowed dogma, fulfilling the 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses (awe vs. grief) act in scene, and her renunciation of exile is earned with visible cost—kneeling in shadow, bearing witness.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—clutching the clipboard “with the weight of dying traditions,” smudging chalk dust with urgency—and their professional ethos (“true anonymity required physical artifacts”) directly fuels high-stakes choices. Contradictory impulses (digital skepticism vs. analog faith) operate simultaneously without tidy resolution. The final transcription feels earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the eroded chalk and vanishing drone. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars the emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her embroidery is both craft and cognition, her contradictions (wisdom disguised as obsession, agency masked as passivity) rendered through tactile micro-choices like dipping the needle to sync Andromeda with overheard intel. Her emotional state degrades subtly under pressure: humming off-key, stitching faster as convergence nears. The captain’s arrival forces no grand declaration, only a needle-pointed “error” that reveals her calibrated risk. Every action aligns with motive, and her final renunciation of direct intervention—trusting the captain to act—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—fear versus love—is rendered with visceral, embodied specificity (“trembling palm,” “wounds shimmered silver”) and sustained contradiction throughout. Her micro-choices (tracing condensation, offering the shard) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act—pushing open the door her younger self couldn’t—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of irreversible witness without alteration. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression layers regret, penitence, and fierce tenderness without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her “shrewdly innocent” facade contrasts with her surgical parsing of trauma, and her micro-choices (tracing coral, decoding notes) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on bearing witness. The final act of placing the coral on the sill embodies renunciation of control in favor of symbolic hope, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief is embodied through tactile engagement with plaster and reef. Her flaw—carrying others’ unspoken dread in her marrow—complicates but does not resolve, making her endurance credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her hunger for color, the ash in her chest, trembling hands—and her contradictions (sorrow and delight, emptiness and rekindling) act simultaneously during the climax. Her micro-choices (kneeling, arranging film, painting with phosphorescent pigment) reveal a hierarchy of values: creation over despair. The final renunciation isn’t of art but of the belief that joy is lost; this endurance carries felt cost (years of silence) and forecloses passivity. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile, sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and contradictory—her struggle between restoration as fidelity versus creation feels embodied, not abstract. Her micro-choices (e.g., pressing the nickel, speaking into the reflector) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over control. The hobo nickel functions as both talisman and contract, grounding her transformation in tactile ritual. However, the shift from restorer to “grower” of murals leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior friction against her professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is crystalline and embodied—his defiance against cognitive taxation manifests in tactile choices (planting coded gardens, crushing the seed). His charm and scholarship aren’t decorative; they’re tactical tools that disarm and organize. The internal conflict between survival and resistance simmers without melodrama, and his final smile conveys earned endurance. However, Dr. Voss remains slightly underdeveloped beyond her functional role, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to photosynthesize pain into beauty—is embodied in every micro-choice, from clutching the postcard to singing off-key lullabies. Her internal conflict (neutrality as both wound and stance) manifests simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The transformation of grief into a garden is earned through consistent, character-specific action under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in trembling hands, fused bones, and petal-polyps.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The caretaker’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: preserving forgotten names against entropy. Her internal conflict—foxglove regret, “beautiful, necessary, and quietly fatal”—embodies contradiction without therapy-speak. Every micro-choice (pruning with “frozen moonlight,” striking the tube deliberately) aligns with her role and reveals hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—accepting transience while continuing her work—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “carefully reckless” hope, the weight of the ink well, and the tension between impetuosity and Julian’s caution feel lived-in and contradictory. Her motivation (absolution through truth) intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes ritualistic action. The final choice—to offer vows or release him—is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost. Julian’s presence deepens the crucible without flattening his agency; his rough voice and tentative touch reveal mutual vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a deeply felt moral inheritance, not abstract duty. His internal conflict—between institutional demands and ancestral wisdom—manifests in precise, embodied choices: falsifying reports, repairing beeswax seals, refusing the upgrade. The phrase “slyly heartfelt” captures his quiet rebellion, and his trembling hands convey emotional weight without diagnostic self-awareness. His final renunciation carries visible cost: professional risk, isolation, and silent stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her mapping of dust motes, trembling fingers on the meteorite, and slow erosion of isolation feel specific and contradictory. Her motivation to preserve “lost songs” emerges organically from trauma, not exposition. The final act of sending Orion north is earned by months of micro-choices (calculating flight paths, living suspended). Her invented history dissolves with palpable cost: she faces the shopkeeper ready to speak her true name.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand sacred thresholds—is embodied through tactile, specific actions (tracing grain, decoding weather codes) rather than abstract yearning. Her internal conflict between loss and discovery manifests in micro-choices: kneeling to read wood, stepping into the maze. The “featherly determined” trait subtly informs her light-footed resolve without over-explanation. However, her father remains a cipher, limiting relational depth; the story wisely avoids needing him on-page, but this constrains the emotional crucible to a solo arc.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking belonging through celestial alignment—is rendered with embodied specificity and internal contradiction, especially in her reliance on the burnt feather as both compass and conscience. Her micro-choices (e.g., pressing her forehead to the glass) reveal a hierarchy of values: connection over isolation, participation over observation. The phantom researcher functions effectively as a crucible, not a foil, forcing her to shift from solitary interpretation to shared breath. However, his emotional arc lacks reciprocal interiority, slightly flattening the relational stakes despite their poignant synchrony.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand why paths disappear—is consistent and compelling, driving her actions throughout. Her interiority is richly embodied through tactile interactions with crater glass and the cave, avoiding diagnostic labels. The “cheerful gloom” captures a nuanced emotional contradiction that deepens under pressure. However, her epiphany about “necessary silences” leans slightly toward unearned lyricism without sufficient prior struggle to fully ground the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—serenading monotony with creativity—is embodied through precise micro-choices (spinning the bishop, winding the music box via breath) that reveal a hierarchy of values: control masked as generosity. His internal contradiction (desire for order vs. reverence for chaos) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The woman’s transformation feels earned because Kael’s interventions are calibrated to her behavioral patterns, not omniscient whims. No diagnostic label-speak; his competence is balanced by the visible cost of emotional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelin’s motivation—preserving forbidden memory through dance and inscription—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly toward her transformation. Her internal conflict between isolation and expression manifests in tactile choices (grinding moonstone, mixing tears) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation of humanity is earned by prior causality: her elective exile was always a rehearsal for this metamorphosis. However, the absence of a second character limits relational crucible, and the flawless execution of her plan slightly undercuts struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between regret and craftsmanship, estrangement and longing—is rendered with concrete embodiment (trembling hands, the stone toss) and consistent professional identity. His motivation stems credibly from accumulated loss, not abstract yearning. However, the decision to “commune” lacks a tangible alternative or counter-pressure, making the final renunciation feel more lyrical than causally compelled. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, but interior contradiction remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars, voice, and micro-choices (e.g., opening the box, placing the marble) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in trauma. Elias’s parallel arc emerges through reactive silence and tactile response, not exposition. Their contradiction—between duty and guilt—is dramatized, not summarized. Final renunciation (“empty box lighter now”) earns its cost through two decades of specific, lived anguish.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her "logical dreaming," with embodied contradictions—e.g., exhaustion paired with vigilance, calculation fused with hope. Her micro-choices (adjusting spirals, releasing balloons) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reason and care. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure or tangible opposition limits the crucible for deeper moral friction. The final renunciation—readiness to send new balloons—carries quiet cost but lacks visceral stakes that would push this into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her “sensitively perceptive nature” manifests in tactile, sensory choices (pressing ear to stone, feeling masonry’s “slow breath”). Her motivation—to map memory, not just space—intensifies credibly through discovery of Elias’s diaries and the film negative. The final choice to carry the past forward feels earned, with visible cost: the burden “settled upon her shoulders.” However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; guilt and duty coexist but don’t clash in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to reveal possibilities through mirrors—is consistent and rooted in his liminal nature, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; he remains "perceptively calm" throughout without meaningful struggle or degradation under pressure. His final renunciation (returning the heartbeat) carries conceptual cost but feels preordained rather than wrestled. The borrowed heartbeat premise creates stakes, yet Elias’s emotional state never truly fractures, flattening the climax’s urgency despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “operatively gentle” nature, the scar tissue she recognizes, her aged knees protesting—all reveal a psyche forged by regret and resolve. Her micro-choices (kneeling, opening the clipboard to soil, not contracts) manifest layered contradictions without diagnostic self-awareness. The general and child apply immediate, credible pressure that forces reconfiguration of her past identity as strategist. Final endurance (“This is real”) forecloses any return to abstraction, with cost legible in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—ruthless industrialist versus secret mourner of extinction—act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. His micro-choices (burying the egg, walking away without looking back) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: ecological devastation for a private ritual of atonement. The interiority is concrete (“calcified shell against his chest,” “weeping alone in his study”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality: the manufactured drought was the price paid to reach this moment of fractured grace.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lys’s motivation—defiance through chastity—is embodied with striking specificity: her “virginity a blade,” her “bodily poetic” gestures, and the cost of resistance are woven into every action. Internal contradiction thrums beneath her grace—fear vs. resolve, solitude vs. purpose—without therapy-speak or abstraction. Her micro-choices (untangling temporal threads despite phantom failures) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible stakes. The final renunciation isn’t escape but endurance charged with sacred terror, fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s internal contradiction—between calligraphic precision and manipulative storytelling—is embodied in tactile choices (burning the stick, surrendering control) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. His transformation from puppeteer to audience is earned through micro-choices: offering the stick, sitting in grime, accepting silence. The blind woman’s story functions as a mirror, not a lecture, forcing Marcus to confront his own complicity without melodrama. Flaws are consistent and costly: his belief in detached observation collapses under the weight of lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her esoteric realism manifests in precise, tactile actions (knotting wings, dismantling towers) that reveal her moral calculus without exposition. Her contradictory impulses—documenting extinction while refusing romanticism, building monuments destined to vanish—are active in-scene, not summarized. The final choice to dismantle the oldest tower after witnessing the last monarch’s departure is earned through consistent behavior and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through ritualized gesture and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—grief and purpose, regret and precision—without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (e.g., “technically gentle pressure”) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by past failure. The final renunciation of perfectionism (“failure was just another mold”) is earned through tactile struggle, not epiphany. Flaws actively complicate her process, and forgiveness emerges as heat enabling bronze to flow—not as abstract resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Foresight Hindsight’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her stillness versus the storm, her duty versus her surrender. The final renunciation of the directive feels earned by her micro-choices: breaking the seal, brewing the mushrooms, stepping into the forest. Her motivation stems from a deep, character-specific yearning to be chosen rather than to choose, which crystallizes in the dream sequence. No diagnostic label-speak mars her epiphany; insight emerges through sensory and symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elior’s frugality, empiricism, and suppressed longing cohere into a psychologically specific interiority. His micro-choices—burning three candles, speaking numbers aloud, pressing his palm—reveal a hierarchy of values where belief is hoarded like tallow. The final act of “spending everything he had saved” crystallizes an earned renunciation with visceral cost (blood mixed with quicksilver). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in ritualized action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his pacifism isn’t passive but strategic, rooted in decades of planning and trauma (the music box). His micro-choices (winding the pin, invoking cellular memory) reveal a hierarchy of values: compassion over force, memory over erasure. The entity’s resentment crystallizes his lifelong conflict, making his final act feel earned. However, the absence of internal contradiction—Elias never wavers—edges toward idealized competence, slightly flattening emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—capturing a runaway dream—is rooted in his identity as a mirror maker and reinforced by tactile, embodied choices (e.g., synchronized breathing, handling the sextant). His internal contradiction (grounded yet seeking the ephemeral) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final renunciation of chasing the dream is earned through prior causality, with visible cost: he anchors the ritual while his consciousness stretches into molten glass. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through frost, breath, and silica.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her feistiness, grief, and professional pride shape every micro-choice, from muttering at pigeons to pruning sprouts with her grandmother’s knife. Her contradictions feel lived: she scorns “poetry” yet enacts it; she seeks reconciliation but works alone. The final act of leaving the ribbon and knife in the tree hollow crystallizes a renunciation earned by prior causality, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; wisdom emerges through tactile action, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her youth and age flickering in reflection, her simultaneous knowing and unknowing. Her micro-choices (retreating to the bathroom, holding the shell aloft) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on surrender to recursive logic. However, her motivation remains slightly abstracted by the lyrical density; the “forbidden knowledge” lacks concrete personal stakes beyond metaphysical yearning, weakening the causal link to her final acceptance. The epiphany feels earned but leans on poetic inevitability over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a precise epistemic mission—rescuing erased concepts—not sentiment, and her internal conflict between linguistic expertise and botanical ignorance drives every choice. Her micro-decisions (e.g., reinterpreting “damaged” diary pages as fungal maps) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over extraction, understanding over action. The final renunciation—accepting that rescue requires non-intervention—is earned through embodied struggle with the mountain’s shifting logic. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile engagement with pressed flowers and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—her mismatched eyes, chimera-warm longing, and narrative-thread weaving reveal a psyche fractured yet purposeful. Her motivation (to recapture their shared story) compels high-stakes micro-choices: braiding strands, accepting “trapped freedom,” reaching through fog. The final handclasp feels earned by her persistent agency, not revelation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, mythic action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her identity as an archivist of “fables of absence,” and her warmly methodical nature informs every micro-choice—from tool arrangement to braid reconfiguration. Her internal conflict between passive preservation and active intervention crystallizes credibly in the climax, with visible cost: she forgoes neutrality to become a participant in history. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, embodying emotion through tactile precision (e.g., fingers tracing warm hemp). However, her flaw remains slightly abstract—her “adaptability” enables success without meaningful struggle or misstep, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her tactile engagement with maps, ice, and stone reveals a character defined by precision and sensory attunement. Her internal conflict (endurance vs. agency) culminates in the earned choice to conjure silence herself, foreclosing passive waiting with visible cost: exhaustion, isolation, and ongoing vigilance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through physical sensation (“trapped bees,” “hammered repose”). The final renunciation of rest-as-escape in favor of tending the silence is credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s retrocognitive gift is embodied through specific sensory echoes and micro-choices—her trembling hands, the weight of backward-seeing certainty—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation to prove coincidences have meaning drives every action, culminating in a final choice that forecloses solitude with visible cost. Internal contradiction surfaces in her longing for purpose versus fear of futility, rendered without diagnostic label-speak. The closure earns its emotional payoff through consistent, flawed agency rather than epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her preemptive nostalgia, tactile transcription rituals, and emotional response to shadows reveal a character whose contradictions (desire to preserve vs. fear of loss) drive micro-choices with tangible cost. Her final realization—that identity is fluid like shadow—is earned through prior sensory and intellectual labor, not abstract epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through action (inking skin, kneeling on humming quartz). The closure reconfigures her role from observer to participant, with the cost of personal dissolution into collective memory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—defying hopelessness through art—is vividly embodied in his chants, spiral dance, and burning ritual. His internal contradiction (sacred vs. ridiculous survival) manifests physically and tonally without diagnostic labels. Micro-choices (e.g., walking faster to turn despair into a “prank”) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost: exhaustion, ash, dawn’s approach. Final renunciation—leaving the rag knot—feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her profession as a tidal-pool chronicler informs her perception, and her emotional conflict manifests through micro-choices (e.g., placing the cicada at the water’s edge). The narrator’s response reveals his own hierarchy of values: patience over demand. Their contradictory impulses—attachment vs. autonomy, clarity vs. ambiguity—act simultaneously without tidy resolution. The final exchange (“Keep this for me…”) crystallizes mutual vulnerability with tangible cost: suspended certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and yearning for silence are embodied with visceral specificity—her trembling hands, the doll clutched during panic attacks, the “stretching contracted rhythm” of her heart. Her internal conflict between inherited safety and desperate openness operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to descend, bearing the gilded hush as ballast, is earned through consistent motivation and forecloses permanent escape with palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory action and constrained micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her professional rituals and sensory attunement, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation—to teach silence as comfort—is dramatized through precise micro-choices (adjusting resonators, rotating the vial) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The architect’s transformation feels earned because Mara’s actions are consistent with her established competence and quiet authority. However, the architect remains slightly underdeveloped beyond her grief, limiting the relational crucible’s depth.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—preservation over power—and her “wisely adventurous” nature manifests in precise, risk-calibrated actions. Her internal conflict between myth and memory is embodied, not summarized, and her final renunciation of the throne is earned through prior choices. The ruby flake’s resonance and tactile engagement with murals ground her emotional arc in sensory detail. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias and Mira’s motivations are deeply rooted in shared trauma, with micro-choices—like Elias pressing palm to palm—that reveal hierarchies of care and sacrifice. Their scars function as both literal and symbolic maps, grounding internal conflict in embodied contradiction.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity emerges through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, skin learning “the memory of deep-sea containment,” and trauma-as-currency reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche under pressure. Her “virtuously mischievous” instinct drives micro-choices that escalate stakes, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses escape in favor of transformation. The final act—pressing the bolt into her palm—is earned by prior causality and charged with the cost of all those she failed. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile, specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—dismantling tyranny through truth—but their interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The “eloquently silent” trait constrains action meaningfully (e.g., not speaking to preserve the acoustic field), yet emotional states are rendered through poetic metaphor (“sweat of righteous pursuit”) rather than visceral, character-specific sensation. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but Kael’s micro-choices (turning the crank slowly, copying symbols) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, the absence of internal conflict beyond noble resolve borders on hagiography, limiting psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Valen’s motivation—“to capture the shape of possibility itself”—is crystalline, consistent, and embodied through micro-choices (stealing the program, unsnapping armor) that reveal his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict between isolation and surrender manifests simultaneously in physical withdrawal and yearning for connection, avoiding tidy resolution. The final renunciation—shedding armor as shedding self-imposed exile—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: dissolution of singular identity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile, alchemical imagery (“vapor of transmutation that smelled of ozone and childhood memory”).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her grief, professional restraint, and moral urgency coalesce in micro-choices like photographing dust patterns before cleaning. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. preservation, despair vs. hope) act simultaneously, not abstractly. The sergeant’s off-page presence functions as a catalytic ghost, not a character, preserving single-POV integrity. Final renunciation of bureaucratic indifference is earned through tactile, embodied acts, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—ink-stained fingers, a stutter, obsessive memory—that drive his actions under pressure. His internal conflict between fear and duty manifests in concrete micro-choices (e.g., running despite trembling hands, using the key). The final act of vanishing into maintenance shafts embodies Earned Stasis: he forecloses personal safety to preserve truth, with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief, duty, and fear of inherited madness, rendered with concrete embodiment—his breath, fingers, chest heaving. His internal conflict (to play or not to complete the prophecy) manifests simultaneously in action and memory. The final renunciation—enduring silence as defense—is earned through prior causality and exacts visible cost: exhaustion, solitude, cyclical vigilance. No diagnostic label-speak; sorrow shapes silences, not explains them.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his meticulousness, grief for lost flora, and mossy delight feel specific and contradictory. His transformation from cataloger to vessel is earned through micro-choices: collecting moonstone dust, rearranging monuments, pressing the needle into bark. The final shift—ribs as wind galleries, skin as breathing bark—is both mythic and physically grounded. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile action and sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “uncertainly certain” gait, her lifelong struggle with control, and the tactile intimacy with gears and time render her flaw (the illusion of mastering chaos) visceral. Her pivotal choice to improvise isn’t a sudden epiphany but a culmination of micro-choices: matching breath to spray, swaying into tilt, leaping where math failed. The final renunciation of rigid planning carries visible cost—her identity as a tinkerer reconfigured, not discarded—and the compass retrieval feels earned through prior struggle, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her regret is “luminous,” her caution costly, her alchemical worldview inseparable from emotion. Kael’s brief presence reveals their bond through tactile detail (his thumb-worn coin) and mutual understanding without exposition. Her micro-choices (pushing instruments beyond calibration, heating the coin) directly reflect her flaw: excessive caution now transformed into calibrated risk. The final renunciation isn’t of love but of restoration; she accepts fracture as architecture—a credible, costly endurance earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to integrate laughter into healing—is rooted in consistent, embodied choices: her bleeding hands, offering blood, and enduring pain to absorb spectral grief. Her internal contradiction (modest fearlessness vs. trembling hands) operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. The final renunciation—descending to seek more souls despite exhaustion—earns closure with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile action (blood, strings, tooth).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is exquisitely embodied, with trauma mapped through proprioceptive precision rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses—seeking mercy while navigating judgment—act simultaneously in scene, not as abstract reflection. The final renunciation of the mask strap is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the scar that measures how much light passes through brokenness. No therapy-speak; every insight arises from somatic memory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss and consistently embodied through tactile, sensory choices (e.g., the weight of grief, hue of exhaustion). Her internal conflict—between honoring truth and navigating erasure—is rendered through micro-choices that foreclose paths (e.g., speaking Mara’s name aloud). However, the nanny’s presence remains spectral rather than interactive, limiting relational crucible depth. The final act of unfastening is earned, but the emotional cost lacks a concrete, irreversible sacrifice beyond narrative labor.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation—“to discover what ceilings hide”—is rooted in her dual expertise as a technician and seer, compelling her to engage rather than flee. Her internal contradiction (professional pragmatism vs. spectral empathy) manifests in embodied choices: climbing the ladder despite cold dread, installing the mainspring not as repair but ritual. The ringmaster’s silent plea is met with diagnostic precision turned compassion, making her final act of mechanical communion feel earned. No therapy-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile perception (“helium balloon tugging at her sternum”) and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a visceral, embodied longing for lived time, not abstract philosophy. Her actions—studying frost, casting plates, shattering the bottled whisper—are micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: chaos over stasis, sound over silence. The contradiction between her role as preserver (librarian) and destroyer (rupture-agent) fuels tension without internal monologue. Final breath is earned by every smudge and crack she leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his sorrow, poetic bias, and reconfigured revolutionary zeal manifest through micro-choices (e.g., refusing to cover mirrors, weeping at the shard). His motivation evolves from fossilized guilt to active custodianship, with clear cost: abandoning conquest for elegy. Contradictory impulses—defunct fighter vs. tender archaeologist—act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation feels earned, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a deeply internalized covenant, and his actions—winding the mainspring, singing the tinkersong—are consistent with his identity as a repairer of invisible fractures. His emotional state is embodied through trembling fingers, weathered palms, and the weight of forty years’ labor, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The story earns his endurance as a form of agency, foreclosing the path of failure at immense cost: the potential end of dawn itself. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or internal debate slightly limits psychological depth, keeping the character just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s “sensibly eccentric” nature is embodied through precise contradictions: steel-toed boots with vials of scent, scientific rigor fused with psychometric intuition. Her motivation—to find where explanations fail—is dramatized through escalating choices (descending the hatch, trusting the compass) that carry tangible cost (isolation, physical risk). The final renunciation of empirical validation (“she wasn’t here to explain”) is earned by prior causality and crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete, sensory, and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her identity as a “spirited driftwood sculptor” and her “perpetually learning” ethos—and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to shift from assemblage to collaborative making. Her internal conflict between control and surrender manifests physically in her hands yielding to the wood’s contours, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice—to trust material wisdom over imposed form—is earned through prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing artistic dominance. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, slightly capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her whisper-quiet speech against her bold art, her grief mistaken for retreat until reinterpreted as faith. Her micro-choices (daily cathedral visits, repainting the mural) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: years of misunderstanding, emotional isolation. The sexton’s revelation catalyzes a credible, earned reconfiguration rooted in prior behavior, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through soil, glass, and pigment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his knuckles whitening, his searing reverie, the tactile horror of drowning through another’s lungs—all revealing a character whose archival duty has become visceral possession. His micro-choices (signaling the winch, kneeling, arranging debris) are morally weighted and consistent with his role as witness. The final renunciation isn’t escape but communion, earned by prior immersion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from sensory overload and historical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in her rejection of false comfort and commitment to authentic creation, intensifying through precise micro-choices (e.g., refusing to smash the bottle). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile memory-work and ethical calculus. The final renunciation of nostalgia for invention is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: solitude transformed not into restoration but responsibility. Her flaw—rigorous idealism—is consistent and shapes every decision without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile communion with bark, wax, and memory reveals a psyche shaped by decades of ritualized listening. His micro-choice to place the shaving under his tongue crystallizes his lifelong devotion into visceral action, carrying tangible cost: the dissolution of archival detachment into somatic absorption. The contradiction between his scholarly precision and ecstatic surrender feels earned, not contrived. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion emerges through sensory immersion and linguistic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in lineage and duty, with interiority rendered through embodied contradictions—“furiously tranquil,” “storm raging in her chest” while hands stay steady. Her micro-choices (singing lowering songs, placing the acorn cap) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over self. The final renunciation—staying to decrease entropy—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: isolation, biological displacement, stewardship without guarantee. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her “credibly curious” nature and concern for communal survival—is consistent and deepens under pressure. Her internal conflict between institutional duty and ancestral wisdom manifests in embodied choices (testing rope strength, rejecting sirens). The final act of pulling the bell rope is earned by prior causality, with visible cost: abandoning seventeen years of calibrated siren work. No diagnostic label-speak mars her epiphany; insight arises through tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his spiritual curiosity manifests in tactile actions (wiping the telescope, pressing the lantern to his chest) and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. His epiphany feels earned through decades of solitude, not imposed. However, the absence of any contradictory impulse or struggle beyond passive reflection slightly limits the depth of his transformation. The final renunciation reads as elegant but lacks a visible cost that alters external circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s silence, trauma, and quiet agency are rendered with profound interiority—his trembling hands, cross-legged stillness, and final acceptance of witness all embody his contradiction: a man severed from speech yet chosen to hold unspoken words. His motivation crystallizes not through dialogue but through tactile engagement with the stained glass box and ghosts, making his renunciation of voice feel earned. The woman ghost’s palm over the box triggers a micro-choice—endurance as vocation—that forecloses escape with visible cost: eternal solitude as archive. No diagnostic labels; emotion lives in teeth-vibrating hums and peeling paint.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand the texture of time—is dramatized through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., extracting the shard, pressing it to her sternum). Her internal contradiction—hoarding stolen moments while seeking continuity—resolves in a credible renunciation of measurement for experience. The urn fragment triggers a visceral, not diagnostic, epiphany (“rough linen dragged across wet skin”), avoiding therapy-speak. However, her transformation leans slightly on conceptual revelation over incremental pressure, softening the causal chain just enough to deny 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile engagement with fragments and the drake’s feather, revealing a consistent worldview rooted in finding beauty in incompleteness. Her micro-choices—repairing the kite not to restore but to reconfigure—demonstrate a hierarchy of values with visible cost (abandoning restoration for transformation). The boy’s presence sharpens her motivation without diluting her agency, and their interaction avoids sentimentality by grounding emotional shifts in concrete action. However, the final insight (“Sometimes the break is where the story begins”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—fostering interspecies respect in the face of death—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., wrapping copper despite declining health). His interiority is concrete (“brazen calm,” steady hands amid cancer) and free of diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of personal survival for ecological legacy is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his deteriorating body. No emotional summarization; embodiment remains precise even at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied skepticism and scientific rebellion, with micro-choices (clutching the amber, rejecting institutional narratives) revealing her hierarchy of values. The ensemble cast remains distinct in motive and function, though their convergence slightly flattens individual pressure. Her “luminous skeptic” stance is consistent and costly—she sacrifices academic legitimacy for truth—but the final renunciation lacks a singular, decisive personal sacrifice that would elevate it to 9+. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarization mars the portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman’s motivation—reclaiming a battlefield through ritualized horticulture—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: patience, linguistic erudition, and reverence for ecological memory. His internal conflict (between futility and faith) manifests simultaneously in micro-choices: mixing ash with salt, whispering dead languages to seeds. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile ritual (“fingers moved with the certainty of ritual”) and sensory immersion. The final renunciation isn’t stated but enacted—sitting silently as the garden begins its “siege,” accepting that reclamation is slow, communal, and avian-guided.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ash’s motivation—translating emotional distance into tangible closeness—is embodied with visceral specificity, especially in his tactile engagement with the wax cylinder and leaf. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering grief through sensory perception (e.g., “tasting cedar and the salt of Mara's skin”). The final choice—to sing, not seek further—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of permanent absence reframed as presence. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction in one interior beat (“hollow space that ached”), but overall masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation crystallizes organically from her neurological uniqueness and ancestral legacy, not as exposition but through embodied choices—clutching the compass rose, sketching under temporal duress. Her internal contradiction (blessed yet exiled) manifests in simultaneous gestures of despair and precision. The final decision to step into the threshold feels earned by prior causality: her mutation reframed as cartographic gift. Cost is visible in “cracked lips” and three centuries of subjective isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation as a “chivalrous thief” is vividly embodied in his actions—stealing bread for orphans, returning gold to widows—and crystallizes in his ritual exchange of truth-laden chess pieces. His internal contradiction (thief vs. healer) operates simultaneously under pressure, especially when hallucinations and altitude sickness claw at him yet he moves with “cautious abandon.” The guardian’s presence forces relational stakes that deepen his arc, and his final descent as “keeper of renewed wonder” earns a credible transformation. Minor deduction: the moral clarity borders on idealized, slightly softening the edge of genuine flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her “benevolently ruthless” clarity coexists with tenderness, and her history as both performer and survivor informs every micro-choice. The motivation to “free the truth even if it destroys comforting lies” is dramatized, not declared, and culminates in a renunciation of safety that carries palpable cost. Her emotional state avoids therapy-speak; instead, gestures like shielding pages while severing cords reveal hierarchy of values. The final act of reading aloud emerges from prior causality, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vey’s motivation—escaping memory through nightly substitution—is embodied in mercury-glass physiology and micro-choices (e.g., pressing palms to stone, using a raven quill). Internal contradiction pulses between self-erasure and the buried talent of comprehension, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses illusion with tangible cost: enduring the pain of memory. The final act—seeding glyphs into bedrock—feels earned by prior causality, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in barb-and-rachis perception, not therapy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his compulsive fidgeting, guilt, and precise movements reveal a psyche fractured by regret yet disciplined by intellect. His final renunciation of self-blame feels earned through the tactile labor of decoding, not abstract realization. The contradiction between his belief in personal culpability and the tapestry’s truth creates authentic internal tension. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action (e.g., “fingers moved with fierce repose”).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s internal conflict—between guarding a “pure” truth and surrendering it to collective reinterpretation—is embodied in their raw, stumbling speech and willingness to fade into the bone. Lira’s presence sharpens this tension through her innocent distortion of Kael’s verses, forcing the artist to confront their own rigidity. The final choice to relinquish authorial control feels earned, with visible cost (voice dissolving into bone). However, Lira’s motivation remains underdeveloped beyond whimsy, slightly weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, breath-holding, and tactile memory-reading convey uncertainty, grief, and resolve without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (touching craters, narrating specific failures) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over erasure, repair over perfection. The final act—smiling amid dissolution—earns her transformation from doubt to certainty through consistent, pressure-driven action. No safety-hedging; her flaws directly enable the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in grief and a promise, rendered with embodied specificity—trembling hands, the weight of absolution, the tactile memory of Marguerite’s brushstrokes. His internal conflict between surrender and completion is active, not abstract, and his final choice to paint again emerges from concrete sensory triggers (the shell, the light, the water). The flaw of avoidance is consistent and costly, and his endurance carries visible emotional stakes. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in limestone, salt air, and stiff sable brushes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trembling fingers, withheld breath, and quiet desperation reveal a man shaped by years of subordination and emotional restraint. His motivation—to prove whispers outlast shouts—is rooted in consistent traits and crystallizes through micro-choices: rescuing the cork, building the receiver, placing it with ritual care. The final act of weeping “with the violence of his own quiet” shows contradictory impulses (tenderness as force) acting simultaneously, not summarized. Voss remains a pressure-source, not a fully drawn character, but that’s appropriate for this single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The patchwork navigator’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her arrhythmic heart, fluctuating cognition, and prosthetic leg drumming against rusted metal convey emotional and neurological states without diagnostic abstraction. Her motivation—to navigate the geography of loss—is rooted in consistent traits (salvage-born resilience, lunar-tied memory) and intensifies through micro-choices: fitting the censer foot, soldering wires, refusing evacuation. The final renunciation—choosing to stay and map absence—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she forfeits reintegration for fidelity to grief. No safety-hedging; her flaws (memory erosion, disorientation) directly shape tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, involuntary truthfulness, and desperate hope for occlusion reveal a psyche under relentless pressure. Her contradictory impulses (scientific rationality vs. ritual superstition) act simultaneously in scene, not as abstract summaries. The final choice to bury the eye and paint her lids is earned through prior micro-choices and carries visible cost: isolation from the collective, risking Council punishment. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath knocked out, hands matching ghost-memory, tactile engagement with the boutonnière—and her micro-choices (descending, investigating absences, mirroring the gesture) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in duty and witness. The final renunciation of solitude-as-emptiness for solitude-as-vessel is earned through consistent ritual and sensory immersion. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through salt, mist, and lichen-like memory grafting. Her eccentricity isn’t quirk but lived consequence, and the closure choice carries visible cost: she accepts eternal watchfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arthur’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, calcified loneliness—and his contradiction between empirical rigor and intuitive trust drives every micro-choice. His final renunciation of passive dealing for active curation feels earned by decades of hinted obsession and the visceral pressure of rising water. The matrix chip and Thomas’s promise anchor motivation without over-explanation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her hollowness as a “swallowed stone,” her renunciation of the crown—and her contradictory impulses (dread vs. resolve, sovereignty vs. sacrifice) act simultaneously in scene. Mara’s presence deepens relational stakes without diluting focus, and their shared history informs credible emotional friction. The final choice—to weave rather than rule—is earned through prior micro-choices (leaving the crown, commanding the mountain). No diagnostic label-speak; transformation arises from tactile, sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to capture the “density of presence”—is vividly embodied through her alchemical tools and micro-choices, especially her decision to approach memory as alchemy rather than nostalgia. Her internal conflict between scientific precision and emotional vulnerability is rendered with concrete, contradictory impulses (e.g., trembling instruments vs. rehearsed movements). Mira’s presence functions as a crucible, forcing Elara to confront unspoken history, and their dialogue reveals distinct voices and shared gravity. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of solitude—choosing shared presence over isolated preservation—with cost legible in the sealed shell and dried palette.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, rotting “present shell,” and envy of past selves reveal a psyche fractured by temporal dislocation. His micro-choices (stepping onto the porch, letting jealousy expand) are consistent with his chronicler identity and directly shape his ascent. The final renunciation—not fixing time but chronicling it—feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his “premature rot.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied: her loss of smell reshapes perception without diagnostic self-awareness, and her micro-choices—examining rust, wrapping the screw in silk—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in attention as care. Her contradiction (grief for vanished scent vs. devotion to visible time) operates simultaneously, not alternately. The final act of returning the screw is earned by prior causality: her tactile archaeology of objects becomes a moral compass. Flawless integration of backstory via present stimuli (the screw, fogged glass) with no emotional summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to transform scars into stories—is embodied through crystallized trauma, micro-choices under breath-hold pressure, and the visceral use of tear-as-ink. Her internal conflict (scholarly rationality vs. childhood superstition) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of the deepest scar is earned by prior causality: each rune inscribed releases a memory, building to the sternum inscription. Flaws (stress-induced crystallization) directly complicate her craft and raise stakes without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her guilt, professional identity, and moral reckoning intertwine without diagnostic self-awareness. Her shift from metaphor to raw apology (“I am sorry”) marks a credible, costly renunciation of her defining trait. The spirit’s silent presence forces micro-choices (adjusting current, kneeling) that reveal hierarchy of values. Flaws drive the arc: her public shaming stems from a cracked lens, not malice, making redemption partial yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—unraveling cosmic illusions through linguistic precision—is consistent and embodied via tactile interaction with the dictionary. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through action (“wanderingly exact” movement) and sensory perception. However, her emotional stakes remain abstract; the cost of failure (permanent silence) is conceptual rather than personally felt, weakening the final renunciation’s emotional weight. The character functions more as an allegorical vessel than a fully individuated psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    The shepherd’s motivation—to understand what clocks truly measure—is embodied in tactile, specific actions (gripping the key, counting backward) and internal contradiction: he trusts neither inherited tools nor mechanical time, yet clings to both. His epiphany emerges not as therapy-speak but through sensory immersion (“the silence between ticks,” “hydraulic resistance of being alive”). The final renunciation—leaving the key—carries visible cost (abandoning lineage) and aligns with his arc. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her spatial cognition, restrained emotion, and history with Eli feel specific and contradictory without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choice to lower the laser pointer enacts renunciation with palpable cost: surrendering control to embrace permeability. Eli’s motivation (“physics of letting go”) avoids sentimentality by grounding abstraction in fungal biology and bodily posture. Their dynamic operates as a crucible where past intimacy pressures present choices, culminating in credible endurance rather than tidy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: her trembling fingers, damaged heart, and inherited contradictions feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices—tracing “clover,” adjusting the wick, calculating probabilities in a notebook—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma and intellect. The tension between her father’s chaotic faith and her disciplined surrender to chance operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Final renunciation (“losing could also be a form of necessary, lucid grace”) is earned through embodied struggle and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—“to teach endings how to begin”—is consistently embodied through micro-choices (hanging up precisely at the streetlamp transition, accelerating the disc for the teenager) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Her internal contradiction (craving connection yet enforcing estrangement) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak even in peak beats; grief “crystallizes into something beautiful and sharp” through concrete action, not therapy-speak. Her final renunciation of gratitude (“disconnected before gratitude could anchor them both”) is earned by prior causality and forecloses attachment with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied grief and micro-choices—her hesitation with the pen, reverence for crushed flowers, and refusal to open the locket all reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. Her motivation (preserving small moments) stems from a specific trauma and drives every action without sentimentality. The final renunciation—bearing witness without the photograph—is earned through seventeen years of ritualized endurance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in walnut ink, salt spray, and curling silver nitrate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—curing loneliness through connection—is embodied in micro-choices: offering tea, pressing the stone into palms, accepting the child’s gesture. His internal contradiction (organizing relief yet feeling isolated) culminates in a credible, earned reversal when he laughs genuinely. The child’s arrival reframes his flaw not as solved but shared, avoiding epiphany cliché. Emotion remains tactile (“cool stone,” “moss-upholstered bench”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in decades of emotional suppression, and her internal conflict—charting others’ hearts while avoiding her own—is rendered through embodied perception (“fingers tremble with comprehension,” “grief marked only with *here there be dragons*”). The final mapping of her own terrain feels earned, though the absence of external pressure or a second character limits the crucible of choice. No diagnostic label-speak mars the climax; instead, emotions emerge as geometry and vibration. A minor slip: the transformation occurs swiftly without visible struggle, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hand, the weight of iridium, the paradox of “confidently uncertain”—and her micro-choices (e.g., using deliberate imprecision in calculations) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her flaw—overconfidence in interpretation—directly caused the colony’s entrapment and now fuels her redemption. The ghost interpreters reflect her internal struggle without head-hopping, and her final humility feels earned. However, her emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“to thresh meaning from experience”) rather than purely sensory contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to translate silence into music after decades of obscurity—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and deepened by loss. His internal conflict between erasure and expression manifests through micro-choices: framing absences with a filmless camera, conducting silence, signing symphonies. Mara’s presence sharpens his stakes without overshadowing his agency. The final renunciation—“No. But the silence will”—is earned, carrying the joyful sorrow of art that outlives recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation evolves from destructive rage to sacred stewardship with visceral interiority and embodied contradiction—e.g., “her rough hands creating delicate lines.” Her final renunciation of anonymity is earned through prior acts of arson reinterpreted as prayer, and the cost (permanent exile, soot-streaked solitude) is legible in the closing image. The “analytically intuitive” trait manifests not as label but as tactile collaboration with the dead archivist’s scars. No diagnostic self-awareness mars her epiphany; insight arises from charcoal, thread, and obsidian.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—resurrecting Elena through quantum-entangled memory—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: his quiet rebellion, percussive navigation, and emotional specificity. His internal conflict (hope vs. grief) manifests simultaneously in tactile drumming and desperate lullabies. The final renunciation (“Stay”) carries visible cost: exhaustion, impermanence, yet enduring belief. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—proving a theory through silence while navigating a world of shouts—are embodied in precise micro-choices: tracing maps, identifying footsteps, passing the coin. Their internal conflict between legacy and innovation is rendered through tactile detail rather than exposition. Voss functions as a crucible, not a foil, with status dynamics legible in subvocal exchanges and choreographed movement. The final renunciation of proof-as-speaking for proof-as-hearing crystallizes a hierarchy of values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s motivation—to teach darkness the value of stars—is consistent and embodied through precise, ritualistic gestures. Their silence reads as character-defining rather than evasive, and micro-choices (adjusting shutters, incorporating ripples) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, interior contradiction is implied but never dramatized in-scene; we see only resolve, not struggle. The final renunciation (lowering the mirror) feels earned but lacks visible emotional cost beyond atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in his synesthetic burden of hearing unspoken thoughts—is rendered with visceral specificity and internal contradiction. His micro-choices (e.g., asking for precise timing without explanation) reveal a hierarchy of values: mercy over clarity, patience over persuasion. The final renunciation—leaving the queen on the stone—earns its emotional weight through decades of accumulated silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in mist, starlight, and chess pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior conflict—between guarded laborer and oceanic self—is rendered through embodied contradiction (“grace like a weapon,” “ache in her guarded heart”) and micro-choices (releasing the mooring cable with precision). Her transformation feels earned, not epiphanic, and Mako’s presence deepens her arc without diluting agency. The scrimshaw functions as both object and psychological key, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final surrender carries visible cost: abandonment of identity, community, and land.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s moral ambiguity is embodied in his ritualized whittling and theatrical narration, revealing a man who once enforced joy yet now tends to grief with performative care. His micro-choices—offering tea as sacrament, handing over the unfinished bird—show a hierarchy of values forged in complicity and regret. The woman’s presence draws out his method without altering his core stance, making his endurance feel earned. His blank face contrasts with precise physical actions, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness while conveying deep internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her identity as a cloud-shadow poet, and her internal conflict—between fear and artistic courage—manifests concretely in her embodied response to the quartz (“teeth ache with beauty,” “tremor of certainty”). The climax reveals her flaw was self-imposed exile, not external censorship, making her transformation earned. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness in the epiphany (“the ban had never been external…”), which borders on label-speak despite being dramatized through action. Still, her final dissolution into shadow feels like a credible endurance with visible cost: loss of fixed form.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s colorblindness and yearning for vision are embodied through precise sensory substitutions (texture, temperature, sound) rather than diagnostic labels. Her “innocently cunning” plant arrangements reveal a hierarchy of values—art over sight, connection over cure—with visible cost: surrendering her best canvas. Marin’s silence and scarred hands convey trauma without exposition, and their mutual awakening feels earned through micro-choices (stem placement, furnace stoking). The final realization avoids epiphany cliché by grounding insight in tactile perception.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through her prism-song training and tactile relationship with sound and fracture. Her motivation—seeking the “texture of connection”—is rooted in lived contradiction: reverence for preservation vs. belief in activation through imperfection. The final choice to strike the fissure, not report it, emerges credibly from her history and values, with visible cost (she stays, foregoing the sanctioned path). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through action, tool, and sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—transforming grief into cartography—is embodied in precise micro-choices (folding cranes, pinning stencils) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions manifest through tactile ritual and contradiction (calm exterior, burning purpose). The young man’s hollow voice triggers recognition, not exposition, deepening her arc without over-explaining. Both characters remain flawed yet credible, their interactions charged by shared loss rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her tactile engagement with cards and tape, revealing a mind that seeks order amid chaos. Her contradiction—rigorous method versus inherited mysticism—is embodied in precise actions, not stated. Elias serves as a credible pressure point, his hollow-eyed presence crystallizing the stakes of failed digital faith. The final renunciation (“Not back… Forward”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The historian’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “anguished joy,” trembling fingers, and erratic dance reveal contradictory impulses in real time. Her motivation (“to pursue forbidden knowledge”) intensifies through micro-choices (humming discordantly, touching the pagoda with unpredictable body parts) that align with her flaw: an obsession that overrides safety. The final renunciation—carrying the empire’s suicide note as a “secret stone”—feels earned by seventeen years of buildup and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a precise, embodied vocation—preserving “the shape of hope”—and her internal conflict (between archival fidelity and intervention) manifests in micro-choices: isolating frames, editing footage not to alter but to reframe. Her emotional arc avoids therapy-speak; grief and resolve are channeled through tactile actions (hands on controls, watching stone rise). The final renunciation—accepting the shadow as transformed rather than destroyed—carries visible cost: she works through the night, alone, trusting a fragile metamorphosis. Her flaw (rigid preservationism) is confronted not by epiphany but by action that redefines her role.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her self-deception, guilt, and recalibration feel visceral, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (removing the pendant, cleaning methodically) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The contradiction between her gentleness and complicity operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Final renunciation of willful blindness is earned through relentless self-interrogation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his surgical pain, coffee-ring divination, and plant telepathy reveal a mind fractured by grief yet driven by ritual. His motivation to “reverse the flow” of time crystallizes into a credible renunciation of closure, earned through prior surgeries and scar-reading. The final choice—to witness rather than suture—is consistent with his arc, though the sister’s preserved presence borders on convenient without clearer causal groundwork. Flawed but not hedged, his struggle feels human, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to find where unused love is stored—is vividly embodied through her spatial imagination and tactile interaction with the film strip. Her internal conflict between longing and duty manifests in concrete sensory perception rather than abstraction. The projectionist’s backstory informs but never overrides her agency; her final realization arises from active psychometric engagement, not passive reception. Minor deduction: the epiphany about love residing “in the beam of light” risks bordering on lyrical overreach, though it’s earned by prior metaphorical groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—freeing trapped creativity—is vividly embodied through tactile details (clay under nails, marble dust) and consistent internal conflict. Her contradictory impulses (urgency vs. required stillness) manifest in scene, not summary. The final choice to rest is earned by prior causality: the instrument’s warmth, the chorus of stars, and her physical surrender all align with her arc. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sensation and action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—cultivating sparks in unlit corners—is embodied through his quantum-guard role and frozen-clock burden, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His dreamless interiority feels concrete (“stripped of shadows like bark peeling”) and consistent. The final choice to become the spark himself earns credible endurance with visible cost: surrendering linear time for distributed existence. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s internal conflict—between fear of his own immensity and the need to engage with the world—is embodied through tactile choices (clutching the gear, pressing it to his temple) and evolves credibly under pressure. His final offering of the gear as a key, not a weapon, feels earned by prior struggle. The stranger serves as a precise crucible, forcing Kael to confront his retreat as avoidance rather than wisdom. No diagnostic label-speak; insight emerges through action and sensory intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling fingers, the “panic she had spent years tethering”—and her arc from dependence to self-reliance feels earned. The final choice to carry Atlas without the leash demonstrates a credible renunciation of safety, with visible cost in her unsteady steps. However, the ferry guides’ dialogue edges into diagnostic label-speak (“unused courage waits…”) that slightly flattens Mara’s epiphany. Still, her contradictory impulses—fear versus longing—are active throughout, not merely summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The bellhop’s internal conflict—between enforced silence and the yearning for expressive truth—is rendered with visceral specificity, especially in his tactile discovery of the bolt and sheet music. His micro-choices (pocketing the bolt, confronting elders, returning to the wall) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, memory over obedience. The elders’ scarred throats and pitying horror deepen the stakes without exposition. His final renunciation of rebellion in favor of patient guardianship is earned through embodied sensation (“nerves singing with newfound sensation”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The diminutive titan’s interiority is rendered through precise, embodied choices—his silent advance, the opening of the grimoire, the sundering gesture—that reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in humility and custodianship. His regally unpretentious dignity manifests not as label but as action with visible cost: he bears millennia of waiting, dissolves his ink pellet’s purpose, and walks away from the crown. The pretender’s unmasking functions as crucible, forcing a stance crystallization that forecloses deception forever. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in parchment-eating ink and sloughing flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s motivation is consistent and deeply personal, rooted in lived witness and intergenerational memory. Her internal conflict—between scientific rigor and emotional attachment to the lost reef—is embodied through tactile rituals (tapping) and concrete choices (transmitting the atlas page). The final renunciation (sending the page away) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she relinquishes a private relic to institutionalize collective memory. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from data gaps, not therapy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bare feet, sharp elbows, and tactile relationship with the ground reveal a consistent, character-specific worldview. Her motivation to find meaning in ruins feels rooted in lifelong defiance of institutional rigidity. The “awkwardly confident” trait manifests in physical choices (approaching stones, pressing palms) that carry subtle cost: isolation, vulnerability, and rejection of tactical pragmatism. However, her epiphany arrives with near-perfect emotional calibration, slightly undercutting the messiness expected mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her aching joints, the taste of chlorophyll-lightning, her conflicted reverence for tradition versus insurgent vision. Her micro-choices (decoding the kite, lowering the amber) reveal a hierarchy of values: evolution over preservation, agency over obedience. The telepathic plant connection avoids therapy-speak and instead manifests as sensory pressure, not diagnosis. Her final smile carries earned cost: she has broken taboo, risking exile, to fulfill a biological covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trauma manifests through somatic markers (trembling fingers, copper taste) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (observing the freeze, planting saplings) reveal a hierarchy of values: endurance over escape, cultivation over erasure. The final act of unfolding the photograph without flinching earns his “pearl of stillness” through consistent, layered behavior. No emotional summarization; grief and resilience coexist in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—escaping hollow portraiture for truth—is consistent and embodied through charcoal-stained fingers, trembling hands, and precise untangling. Her internal conflict (desire for truth vs. terror of multiplicity) manifests simultaneously in action and perception. The final choice to descend is earned by prior causality: sorting threads reconfigures her agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile, sensory detail (“luminescent ache,” “crushing weight of fragmented reality”).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The albino tracker’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—“serene anger,” glacial motion paired with decades of obsession—and his final dissolution feels earned by consistent traits. His micro-choices (uncorking the vial, surrendering to the ink) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over survival. However, the epiphany arrives with near-diagnostic clarity (“because consciousness expands...”) that borders on unearned articulation for a man mid-crisis, slightly flattening emotional complexity. No secondary characters dilute focus, but the lack of interpersonal friction limits the crucible dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal conflict is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, constricted throat, and moral vertigo feel specific and pressurized. Her motivation (to unfreeze a suppressed dialogue) emerges organically from her role as archivist, not abstract idealism. The choice to leak the letter is earned through her professional identity and accumulated silence, with clear cost: neural erasure and loss of sanctuary. However, the transition from hesitation to action leans slightly on “crystalline clarity” rather than granular psychological struggle, missing a hairline opportunity for deeper contradiction in the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—pruning with a repurposed blade, etching values into sandbags—that reveal her pacifist ethos as active resistance, not passivity. Her “senselessly perceptive” trait manifests as a survival mechanism, not a label, and her renunciation of her father’s violent legacy is earned through consistent action. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, emotion emerges through tactile ritual and environmental interaction. However, the lack of an on-page interpersonal crucible slightly limits demonstration of relational stakes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his anxiety “transliterated” into iron, his silence as active force—but his motivation lacks friction; the goddess’s echo is pursued without tangible internal conflict or competing desire. His cool-headedness reads as static rather than tested, and while his actions align with his goal, the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene prevents full 9+ eligibility. The rail spike’s emotional transduction is compelling but borders on metaphorical convenience without deeper psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her “solemn playfulness” coexists with moral urgency, and her micro-choices (e.g., using squid ink, sealing with blood-red wax) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation intensifies logically from verification to public correction, and her flaw—devotion to observational truth—drives both her inheritance and its undoing. The final renunciation of wealth for integrity is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile action and precise metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt isn’t named but felt through trembling hands, visceral dissonance, and the weight of inked constellations. Her contradictory impulses (flight vs. return, silence vs. sound) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she both clutches the letters and activates forbidden protocols. The final choice—to tether across time—is earned by two decades of penitent labor and culminates in a renunciation of her exile, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; even peak emotion remains grounded in tactile, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s whimsical profession and socially perceptive trait are vividly embodied, not merely labeled, and directly shape her diagnostic actions in the grotto. Her internal contradiction—between artistic playfulness and urgent purpose—is rendered through tactile choices (scattering sand, pressing palm to stone) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation of the tile flake carries visible cost: its dissolution marks both resolution and loss. However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward lyrical inevitability over messy human struggle, just shy of full 9+ causality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and morally complex—augmented limbs contrast with delicate touch, retrocognition layers past/present without therapy-speak. Their motivation (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is dramatized through micro-choices: pressing the tessera, refusing to look back. The final renunciation—naming the plaza “Cradle”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: enduring pain without healing it. Contradictory impulses (strength vs. tenderness, memory vs. erasure) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Julian’s motivation—luring possibility from despair—is rooted in his synesthetic perception and ghostly condition, compelling him to act with emotional specificity. Mara’s despair is embodied through the box cutter and curled posture, avoiding diagnostic labels. Their interaction hinges on micro-choices: Julian sings, offers the coin; Mara reaches, stands, leaves the blade. The renunciation of suicide is earned through sensory reconfiguration, not epiphany, though her internal shift leans slightly toward the abstract at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in micro-choices—holding trembling hands while doubting the pills, whispering disbelief yet acting on somatic signals. Her internal contradiction (doubt vs. love) fuels every gesture, and her final renunciation of telepathy-as-connection is earned through tactile, emotionally costly labor. The brother-memory isn’t abstracted; it alters her present urgency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest as stomach clenching, breath catching, goosebumps.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—to become the voice of the unknown for sleeping humanity—is clear, consistent, and embodied through tactile choices (clutching the fossil, activating heat-mapping, singing). Interiority is rendered through sensory perception rather than diagnostic labels, and micro-choices (e.g., floating deeper, releasing anchors) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over solitude, memory over oblivion. The fossil synchronizing with Kael’s heartbeat risks veering into sentimentality but is grounded by the procedural framing of mapping. No second character dilutes focus, allowing single-POV intensity to carry emotional weight without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her devotion to time’s fluidity—and intensifies credibly as she shifts from preservation to transformation. Her internal conflict between duty and agency manifests through embodied actions (sorting buttons, placing the echo) rather than abstract introspection. The final choice to shatter the jar and invert time upward feels earned by prior micro-choices and accumulated wisdom. However, her emotional arc lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; she moves smoothly from fear to inspiration without visible struggle or hesitation that would deepen plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her shame over recklessness wars with her resolve to act despite fear. The micro-choice to surrender the chip, not for the organization but “for the fix,” reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Marcus functions as both betrayer and mirror, their shared history pressuring Elena toward renunciation rather than revenge. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, numb fingers and shallow breath embody her tension.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—his micro-choices (stitching, sensing the tide) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in compassion and patience. His motivation (“to distill complexity into essence”) is dramatized through action, not stated abstraction. The palimpsest promise shows layered contradiction: old oaths scratched out but never fully erased, reflecting genuine moral struggle. Final renunciation isn’t passive waiting but active readiness, earned by decades of disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kai’s motivation—understanding why some places resist change—is embodied through precise, sensory-driven micro-choices (e.g., not taking honey, leaving the lantern) that reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reverence rather than extraction. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion manifests as vibration in teeth and throat, heartbeat as phototropic attractor. The final renunciation (leaving the glass) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she departs without tangible proof, only transformed understanding. Contradictory impulses—sharpness and gentleness—act simultaneously in her posture and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is rooted in generational care—her parents’ legacies—and her internal conflict between grief and duty manifests in embodied choices: the tactile grip on oar and gauge, the wistful pragmatism of her movements. Her final act isn’t redemption but transmutation: private mourning becomes public guardianship. The bitting gauge tooth, once inert, becomes an instrument of calibrated light, revealing a hierarchy of values where tending transcends possession. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in calloused hands and quivering hush.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“humming... vibrated in her teeth,” “brittle awakening crystallize within her”) and contradictory impulses—longing for connection versus forging independence. Her motivation intensifies credibly from grief to agency, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses mourning with tangible cost: the “last fragile piece of her old self snap[ping] cleanly away.” No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany emerges from action (placing the sundial, sitting in resonance). However, the absence of external pressure or secondary characters limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her silence, her tactile longing for pens, her recognition of the nest’s architecture as mirror to her own emotional structure. The return of Mara crystallizes a seventeen-year repression without melodrama, and Elara’s shift from ghostwriter to weaver is earned through micro-choices: descending the stairs, lifting the nest, building publicly. Her flaw—believing her story had “no recipient”—is not just stated but structurally embedded in her occupation and isolation. The final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost: vulnerability replaces control.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her trembling hands, the pressure in her temples, the cautious hope—all rooted in her scientific rigor and moral resolve. Her motivation intensifies credibly as stakes rise, culminating in a high-risk choice that forecloses safety. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions emerge through action (e.g., smoothing creased charts post-crisis). However, her flaw remains underexplored beyond competence, limiting full contradiction in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” instinct are embodied in micro-choices—hesitating at the narrowing throat, counting heartbeats during organ chords—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her terror and determination coexist without tidy resolution, and her final act of “wistful rebellion” feels earned by prior causality. The compass point isn’t just a tool but an extension of her grandfather’s legacy and her own precision, making her defiance deeply personal. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through breath, pulse, and spatial awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but the engine of her method and emotional arc; her struggle to bridge neurological limitation with empathic necessity drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between detached precision and awakened feeling culminates in a credible, costly shift: she feels the drawn face as “living, breathing anguish,” not data. Her motivation—justice fused with self-reclamation—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment is precise (“charcoal that smudged in the heavy humidity,” “breath shallow in the furrowed hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in ancestral loyalty and intellectual rigor, embodied through tactile interactions with the journals and copper nail. Her internal conflict—between institutional doubt and private conviction—fuels credible micro-choices (e.g., transmitting despite isolation). The meteorologist’s brief presence adds relational pressure without diluting focus. However, her emotional calibration remains slightly too coherent under extreme stress, missing the irrationality expected mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—his desire for silence clashes with his compulsion to play, and his guilt over the bridge collapse manifests in tactile detail (fingers bleeding, glass flake warming). His motivation is consistent and intensifies organically, culminating in a credible renunciation of “never” that forecloses his past self with visible cost. The hitchhiker functions as a projection of his unresolved trauma, not a separate character, so relationship dynamics are appropriately absent. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., following the scaffold wrap).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied and morally complex, with contradictions woven into his perception of his father’s legacy versus his own complicity in "legitimate" predation. His micro-choices—arranging currency as territorial markers, nailing a rupee note as warning—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by shame, inheritance, and hard-won clarity. The final decision to leave at dawn feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost in the relinquishment of sanctuary. No diagnostic label-speak; his calm is shown through tactile ritual, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied grief and professional ritual, with micro-choices (pressing the telegram to the dome, writing in rhythm with stellar pulses) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her motivation—decoding her brother’s final quest—is consistent and intensified by loss. However, the epiphany about “shared burdens” leans slightly toward diagnostic articulation (“ledger of collective pain”) without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene; the emotional arc resolves with clarity but minimal friction between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s warlike serenity and guarded interiority are embodied with precision—her micro-choices (planting feet, releasing the seed) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation intensifies coherently from “find lost things” to confronting truth’s imprisonment. The final unbending of her heart is earned through prior causality and carries felt cost: sorrow admitted but duty retained. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through posture, gesture, and sacred katas.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara and Kael’s motivations are vividly rooted in trauma and duty, with interiority rendered through embodied sensation (“fingers trembled,” “gasping in a present that shouldn’t exist yet”). Their relationship functions as crucible: scars map shared history, and their reunion forces a high-stakes choice. However, the emotional arc leans slightly on lyrical assertion over granular contradiction—e.g., “anxious elation” is named more than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. The final renunciation of root-bound stasis feels earned, though the cost is atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation—grief for his sister—is rendered with visceral specificity, not abstract longing. His reckless idealism manifests in concrete micro-choices: burning the card, descending into the orchard, offering himself to the tree. The final renunciation (“some destinies could not be traded, only shared”) is earned through embodied struggle, not epiphany. His internal contradiction—fiercely gentle yet self-destructive—drives every action without therapy-speak or diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marcus’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his tactile memory of speaker cloth, the metallic ghost of applause, the echo of past failure—all reveal a psyche shaped by loss and performance. His contradictory impulses (craving certainty vs. knowing its illusion) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final choice to declare authenticity despite doubt is earned through layered micro-choices: reciting specs, examining the photo, feeling the boy’s desperation. Cost is visible: he sacrifices professional integrity for mercy, reconfiguring his identity from appraiser to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief, scholarly devotion, and analogical reasoning—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly toward his dissolution. His internal conflict (desire to contact Arishti vs. respect for her autonomy) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to become the bridge—is earned by prior causality and carries irreversible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile ritual (tracing cuneiform, warming seed) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s internal conflict—between preserving wandering identities and fixing them into permanence—is embodied through ritual action rather than exposition. Its motivation is consistent, rooted in duty to a broken time, and its endurance (not transformation) constitutes an Earned Stasis. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but the single-POV interiority remains coherent, specific, and constrained by physical limits (moon-phase strength). No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, breath in thinning air, and the unnamed weight of abandoned hopes feel specific and earned. Her final choice to preserve the bunker emerges from a lifetime of unspoken longing, not sudden epiphany. The micro-choice to delete the record and crown the stalagmite reveals a hierarchy of values (connection over protocol) with tangible cost: professional risk, isolation, and irreversible commitment. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through tactile perception and ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile perception of moss, rust, and sound reveals a mind reawakening with dangerous clarity. Her contradictory impulses (to remember vs. to numb, to play vs. to flee) operate simultaneously in scene, not as abstract summaries. The final choice—to play, to return to the site of trauma—is earned through micro-choices (photographing graffiti, copying messages, testing the accordion) that cumulatively reconfigure her stance. No diagnostic label-speak; even “lithium” and “diagnosis” are grounded in sensory consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dreamer’s motivation—rooted in her mother’s unspoken goodbye—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice. Her internal conflict between hope and dread manifests through tactile actions (tracing spines, reading the watch), not abstract reflection. The confidence man’s legacy reframes her past without over-explaining, preserving mystery. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible renunciation or irreversible cost at closure, slightly undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—career safety versus historical truth—are embodied through tactile, sensory choices (touching jasmine, spilling coffee, opening the case) rather than abstract deliberation. Her telepathy with plants and synesthetic perception of coffee stains feel intrinsic to her worldview, not tacked-on traits. The final act of singing the violin into dissolution is earned by prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: truth over preservation, memory over artifact. Her emotional state degrades plausibly under stress—panic, spillage, trembling—without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to capture a soul’s final echo—is rooted in consistent, embodied practice and deepens through precise, tactile choices (e.g., combing the dancer’s hair to align neural pathways). Her internal contradiction—between scientific precision and spiritual reverence—is rendered without therapy-speak, via action and sensory detail. The absence of secondary characters simplifies relational dynamics but intensifies focus on her solitary ritual. Her final act of placing the chip in the archive is an Earned Stasis: she endures eternal recurrence, foreclosing personal closure for cosmic preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied, with grief and duty interwoven through tactile memory (the jade pin) and micro-choices (climbing, planting). His contradictory impulses—holding on vs. surrendering—are active in scene, not summarized. The final act of planting the pin is earned by decades of stalled grief and culminates in a credible, costly renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and ritualized action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s “sincerely insincere” paradox is embodied in every micro-choice—from accepting silver with gratitude to fabricating absolutions—and culminates in the unhooking of the cloak, a renunciation that forecloses his old method at visible cost. His internal contradiction (“a fraud who believed in his fraudulence”) acts simultaneously, not as alternating moods but as a coherent, pressurized identity. The cartographer’s absolute certainty forces Elias into vulnerability, and his trembling hands reveal protected fragility without therapy-speak. Final choice—to offer ambiguity instead of absolution—is earned by prior causality and deepens his professional ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The backwards-aging researcher is rendered with profound interiority: his softening hands, dissolving memories, and shifting perception are embodied, not explained. His micro-choice to cast the stone—and more crucially, to withhold certain ripples—reveals a hierarchy of values centered on future pedagogy over present understanding. The final renunciation (vanishing into pure potential) is earned by decades of disciplined observation, with the cost being his very self. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail like the river stone’s increasing weight in weakening palms.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skimmer’s internal contradiction—between motion and stillness, violence and reverence—is embodied in his petrified posture and the pulse within the arrowhead. His historically reverent grasp and weathered resolve manifest as concrete, character-specific traits that shape perception and choice. However, the final renunciation lacks a visible micro-choice that alters tactics; it emerges as epiphany rather than decision under pressure. This slightly undermines the "earned" quality of his stasis, though the emotional arc remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his yearning for “sacred in the simple” manifests through embodied choices like unstrapping, stepping onto the gantry, and embracing the keystone. His contradictions (obedience vs. rebellion, inadequacy vs. quiet conviction) operate simultaneously in scene, not as abstract summaries. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: his failure within the system stems from a value misalignment dramatized throughout. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture (“pressed his palm,” “excavated it carefully”) and cost (abandoning certification seals, becoming “part of the spire’s forgotten architecture”).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in layered familial duty and quiet obsession, embodied through tactile actions—adjusting lamps, descending planks, handling the key tag—not exposition. His internal contradiction (caretaker vs seeker) manifests in “wandering purposefully,” a phrase that encapsulates his disciplined yearning. The final realization—that his work was never about the pier lights—feels earned because every prior beat aligns with his grandmother’s hidden covenant. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in the warmth of the brass fob and the trembling lantern light.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her doubt, enthusiasm, and cosmic burden interweave without diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (casting coins, tuning the receiver) reveal a hierarchy of values under extreme pressure. The contradiction between stellar doubt and quiet enthusiasm fuels her final act credibly. No head-hopping or knowledge drift; her flawed yet resolute agency earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The reaper’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—grief as nameless, formless terror made tangible through embodied perception (“weight of absence pressed harder than any obligation”). His contradictory impulses (to hold vs. release, to serve death vs. mourn love) coexist in scene, not summary. The final renunciation—scythe as pen—is earned by prior causality and crystallizes his transformation with visible cost: he remains in the dome, enduring named sorrow rather than escaping it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete ritual and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictions—earnest yet naive, brittle yet persistent—are embodied in precise micro-choices: aligning bell fragments by drip-count, whispering fizzling spells, clutching the railing while doubting miracles. Her limitations (lukewarm magic, spider-silk will) directly shape her tactics and stakes, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final endurance—counting anew as water seeps—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: she accepts reconstruction as endless vigil, not triumph. No safety-hedging; her mediocrity is the engine, not a flaw to overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation evolves credibly from dutiful warden to truth-bearer, grounded in tactile discovery and generational memory. His internal conflict—between institutional loyalty and moral reckoning—is embodied in micro-choices (brushing clay, gathering photos) rather than stated. The epiphany feels earned because it emerges from physical evidence, not abstraction. However, the leap from observer to archivist lacks a visible hesitation or counter-impulse at the climax, slightly softening the cost of his new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rigid scholar versus suppressed dreamer—is dramatized through embodied choices: her loosened hair, the hidden wooden horse, the visceral response to the starlings. Her transformation feels earned because every micro-choice (clutching the crystal, placing the horse) reveals a hierarchy of values long in conflict. The final integration avoids tidy resolution by grounding epiphany in tactile ritual rather than abstract realization. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion emerges through sensory specificity and symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and pressure-tested—her muscle memory, micro-fracture detection, and silent heartbeat all reveal a hierarchy of values under extreme stakes. Her contradiction (guardian vs. former jumper) manifests physically, not abstractly. The final choice to secure Kael’s buckle—and the warmth she feels afterward—earns closure with visible cost: enduring the watcher’s burden alone. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her numbness, cracked mind, and hollow bell perception feel character-specific, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (touching the jar, opening it, pressing her forehead to the tissue) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure: synthesis over rejection or surrender. The final weeping carries visible cost—salt cutting tracks on cheeks that “had forgotten sensation”—making emotional reintegration earned, not asserted. Contradictory impulses (survivor vs. clone, emptiness vs. fullness) act simultaneously rather than alternating in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation—creative suffocation and the need to reimagine experiential puzzles—is vividly embodied and consistent. Her internal conflict between industry conformity and radical innovation drives every action, from planting the seed to designing scent-triggered chambers. However, her emotional state remains largely intellectualized; moments of doubt or fear are filtered through lyrical abstraction rather than visceral, contradictory embodiment. The final renunciation of commercial safety is earned, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—restoring lost laughter through mechanical ritual—is rooted in a vivid, specific past and embodied in his phantom clutching of the pull cord. His internal conflict (eager yet mournful) manifests simultaneously in action and desire, not summary. The final act of macerating regret into nourishment is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief is processed through tactile, idiosyncratic labor.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fox-headed librarian’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “maternal ferocity,” “dimensionally homesick heart,” and tactile rituals (“licked her chops, tasting ozone and old paper”) reveal a complex psyche. Her contradictory impulses (longing for home vs. embracing uncertainty) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of return is earned through micro-choices: interiorizing the call, collecting shadows, wearing the pendant as illumination rather than anchor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels irrational yet coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—interrupting a “stifling destiny”—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: his stoic sensitivity, alchemical futility, and tactile reverence for the crozier. His internal conflict (faith vs. transformation, preservation vs. destruction) manifests simultaneously in micro-choices (e.g., adjusting heat not to mend but to unmake). The final crystalline object earns his emotional shift without epiphany; his “dangerous, exhilarating weight of future possibility” feels viscerally won, not declared. Flaws like diagnostic self-awareness are avoided; instead, his struggle is shown through ash, smoke, and fractured wood.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a lifetime of disciplined inquiry, and her rejection of protocol (“she did not mount the fragment in the isolation chamber”) reveals a character willing to risk death for insight. Her internal contradiction—rigorous empiricism versus intuitive leap—is embodied in precise micro-choices under pressure. Emotion remains professional yet palpable (“trembling hands” after success), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation isn’t of method but of dogma, with cost legible in the towers’ groan and collapsed fields.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s resilient positivity is consistently embodied—not just stated—and directly informs his crisis response, especially when he whistles through hurricanes and anchors others amid temporal chaos. His micro-choices (tuning the radio, guiding the child) reveal a hierarchy of values: connection over control. The child in the yellow coat crystallizes his motive without sentimentality. However, internal contradiction is muted; his competence borders on effortless, slightly flattening emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the texture of connection—is embodied through micro-choices (weaving, piercing her palm) that escalate logically from obsession to self-dissolution. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through tactile perception (“fibrous, tensile, and tasted of copper and salt”). The final surrender feels earned by prior causality: each stitch tightens the boundary until she becomes it. No emotional flatlining; her calm deepens even as form disperses, maintaining character-specific paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—grief and wonder coexist without resolution, embodied in tactile detail (“rust bloom across its iron like old blood”). Her motivation (survival through navigation) intensifies under pressure (oxygen limits, starvation), compelling higher-stakes action (launching the expedition). The final choice—to depart—is earned by prior causality: her expertise, the chain link’s repurposing, and months of calculation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through perception and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the chain to glass as a sighting tool).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath in the cold, the hearing aid’s pulse against her eardrum—and her micro-choices (descending alone, pressing the device deeper) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost. Thomas’s appearance reframes her mission without distorting her core motivation. The final act of leading him upstairs feels earned by her consistent commitment to “protecting vulnerable voices,” not imposed by plot convenience. Her emotional state degrades believably under stress, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and drive to “stand by the unremembered” form a taut, contradictory core that fuels every decision. Her interiority is vividly embodied—throat tightening, breath shallow—and avoids diagnostic label-speak even in peak stress. The final choice to enter the chamber isn’t just brave but psychologically inevitable, given her history with the facility and her neurotic attunement to “drowned voices.” The cost—carrying the “crashing hush” forever—is felt in bone, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her heartbeat-counting, tactile obsession with the porcelain shard, and visceral fear of bureaucratic erasure coalesce into a coherent, contradictory psyche. Her motivation—to reclaim identity from systemic deletion—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., pressing the shard into her palm, manipulating moonlight). The integration of ghost and self feels earned, not epiphanic, with clear cost: surrendering the need to count, to prove existence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in ice, ink, and pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The copper-veined storyteller embodies profound interior contradiction: her articulate whisper preserves language even as it risks feeding the diamond’s curse. Her micro-choices—reading bird patterns, stepping softly, placing the gem—are precise, costly, and rooted in consistent traits. The final act of speaking the creation myth despite personal risk earns her endurance with visible cost: dimming veins, silence after completion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile (porous bone, warm diamond, glowing copper).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bitterness, grief, and cosmic ambition manifest through tactile sensations (the arrowhead burning, skin shimmering) and micro-choices (confessing into the phone). Her transformation feels earned by consistent emotional logic, though her shift from researcher to cryptid lacks a decisive internal fracture point. The absence of on-page interaction with Marcus limits relational crucible, but her solitary arc compensates through credible self-contradiction: seeking understanding while courting dissolution. Final renunciation of human form carries felt cost, yet the speed of metamorphosis slightly undercuts psychological granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling bow, pulse against the locust shell, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values (beauty over order) with tangible cost. Her motivation stems from consistent traits (musician as insurgent), and her final act of walking east shows credible endurance. The statues’ shift from enforcers to wonderers mirrors her internal reconfiguration without head-hopping or diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek’s motivation is rooted in a consistent, quietly defiant ethos—his “respectfully rebellious” nature drives tangible micro-choices (e.g., bowing at checkpoints while smuggling letters). His internal conflict between duty and danger manifests through embodied tension (satchel cutting into shoulder, hair standing on end near the storm bottle). The final act—delivering the letter to slot thirty-one—is earned by prior pattern recognition of absences, not convenience. Cost is felt in his isolation and risk, yet never melodramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—interpreting silence as possibility—is embodied through his carpentry, sensory perception, and ultimate song, all rooted in consistent, quietly persistent traits. His internal conflict between loss and creation manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous tension: he moves with patience yet carries urgent longing. The final choice to rebuild is earned by thirteen years of listening, with the cost being his long-held identity as voiceless. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (calloused hands, misting hush) and contradiction is woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s motivation is rooted in a deeply personal analog memory, and her “sanely eccentric” trait informs her navigation of hyperbolic space with emotional and intellectual consistency. Her micro-choices—tracing the scarf, stepping into the fold—are embodied and tied to her grandmother’s legacy. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized under pressure; we see resolve, not struggle. The final act feels earned, but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a visceral, embodied grief—her hollow chest, the scent of her grandmother’s vanished garden—and her actions (climbing the island, painting with light) emerge from that ache. Her internal conflict between longing and restraint is consistent, though the resolution leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The final choice to vitalize the dream as sanctuary—not possession—is earned, but the absence of tangible resistance or failure during the climax softens the cost. Still, her micro-choices (e.g., using shadows and hope as pigment) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to memory and creation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vey’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her tactile relationship with mechanisms, the ache from the humming hair, and her quiet boldness reveal a character shaped by intimate knowledge and loss. Her micro-choices—spinning to disorient fear, whispering the poet’s name—are rooted in established traits and carry visible emotional cost. The backstory with the poet is anchored in present stimuli (the lock of hair) and alters her tactics without flattening pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her chronic curiosity manifests in tactile rituals (mud, journal, compass) and culminates in a decisive, costly act that breaks decades of passive observation. Her micro-choices (e.g., placing the compass at the ring’s center) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety, sister over self. The return of Lila isn’t just rescue but earned reconfiguration through Elena’s scholarly rigor turned into sacrificial action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through precise physical detail (“knees sinking into the mud that had once fed apple trees”).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her backward walking, trembling fingers, and “combative tenderness” reveal a psyche shaped by trauma and duty. The shadow’s silent agency creates a credible crucible; their relationship evolves through pressure, not exposition. Her final choice to walk forward is earned by incremental shifts in both characters’ postures, with visible cost: the relinquishment of protective distance. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through gesture and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his identity as a guardian of wonder, and his insatiable creativity manifests through precise, embodied choices—tracing sigils, dancing from gray tendrils, capturing laughter and iridescence. His internal contradiction (creative urgency vs. exhaustion) simmers beneath calm action, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—planting the seed rather than hoarding its power—is earned by decades of stewardship implied in his stained hands and generational duty. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the cost of his act (personal depletion) is stated but not viscerally dramatized beyond “exhausted but content.”

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her broken mask, her confession, and her method reveal a self-aware yet conflicted restorer whose flaws actively shape her choices. Her motivation intensifies credibly: she unravels knots not just to free spirits but to absorb their silence, a sacrifice that culminates in Earned Stasis. The line “Only a cracked vessel can hold this kind of silence without shattering completely” crystallizes her tragic logic without diagnostic over-articulation. Her final stillness carries visible cost—she becomes the net—and the renunciation feels inevitable, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is embodied in precise, character-specific choices (e.g., refusing to disturb the chapel’s atmosphere). Her internal contradiction between scholarly rigor and reverence manifests physically (reverent hesitation, motionless sitting). The final renunciation—leaving the map torn—earns its cost through consistent traits. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge via tactile perception and micro-actions.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Julian’s interiority is richly embodied—his “quietly analytic” approach, tactile interaction with the snow globe, and history with Death reveal a character shaped by grief and precision. His micro-choices (e.g., tuning to 37 Hz) stem from consistent traits and culminate in an Earned Stasis: he leaves the globe behind, accepting that some truths must remain submerged. The relationship with Death functions as both metaphor and crucible, deepening motivation without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to articulate unspoken needs—is consistent, embodied, and culminates in a credible renunciation that forecloses her isolation with visible cost. Her internal conflict (longing for connection vs. mechanical solitude) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The ghost functions as a mirror rather than a true secondary character, but Elara’s micro-choices—pressing the bolt plate, singing despite rust—reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion is conveyed through tactile detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “warmly inquisitive” nature manifests through tactile choices (aligning cipher wheels, tracing diary pages) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Her motivation intensifies coherently from curiosity to inheritance of the captain’s ethos, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses emotional detachment. The final image—goggles as a “crown of broken glass”—reveals her reconfigured identity without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; contradictions (awe amid desolation) feel lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—proving that “empty spaces remember”—is rooted in her idiosyncratic cloud-emotion taxonomy and crystallizes through embodied action (tying knots) rather than abstract reflection. Her internal contradiction (desire for connection vs. revelation in isolation) plays out simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—memorializing the break rather than seeking rescue—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she renounces return for revelation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile perception (patina, frayed fibers, creaking gondola).

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s face blindness and hyper-tactile perception are embodied throughout, driving every micro-choice with specificity and cost. Her internal contradiction—painting souls without seeing faces—is rendered not as diagnosis but lived reality, especially in her fractal brushwork and reliance on touch-encoded pigment ratios. The final renunciation (not watching the tree fall) is earned through prior causality: she has already internalized the sky. No therapy-speak or unearned epiphanies; emotion emerges through texture, silence, and muscle memory.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied curiosity and sociable isolation, with micro-choices (brushing dust, sketching patterns) revealing her values under pressure. Her motivation—charting discovery—is consistent and intensifies credibly as she deciphers the cipher. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; wonder dominates without friction from fear, doubt, or fatigue that would deepen plausibility. The final renunciation of solitude feels earned but slightly untested by internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in communal survival and personal legacy. Her internal conflict—between urgency and patience—is embodied through tactile choices (e.g., trembling fingers, instinctive guidance of gears). The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion arises through sensory detail (“air tasted of driftwood nostalgia”). However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle, softening the cost of her earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her distrust of silence and her grief-tinged loyalty to Thomas. Her micro-choices—reexamining charts, leading the midnight effort—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in communal survival over personal skepticism. The ghost’s motivation remains consistent, though his agency is posthumous and spectral, which slightly limits reciprocal pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to whisper a lullaby across millennia—is vividly embodied and consistently drives her actions, culminating in the resonant sacrifice of the puppet head. Her internal conflict between duty and compassion is rendered through tactile choices (placing the head, tracing its jaw) rather than exposition. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized resolve; the “bruised awe” feels more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation lacks a visible micro-struggle that would ground its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—grief for her brother and reluctant duty—is rooted in specific, embodied choices (e.g., placing nuts with “offhandedly exact” precision) and sustained by interior contradiction: she resents the labyrinth yet acts with meticulous care. Her emotional state is conveyed through physical detail (“shoulders hunched,” “fingers moving with delicate precision”) rather than diagnostic labels. The backstory of her brother’s death directly informs her present urgency without over-explaining. However, her internal conflict remains slightly muted in peak moments, lacking a fully dramatized micro-turn that would push this into the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied through her chemist’s perception of the world—polymer chains, surface tension, chitin structures—making her grief feel specific and earned. Her contradictory impulses (abstraction vs. connection, guilt vs. understanding) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to design a new polymer inspired by river foam—is rooted in consistent traits and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to find the origin of stories—drives every micro-choice, from how she arranges bottles to how she measures silence. Her internal contradiction (seeking genesis while bound by parole) is embodied in precise, tactile actions, not summarized. The final renunciation—abandoning her cart and bottled moonlight—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: loss of conditional freedom. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory perception and spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—sandpapering rough memories—is embodied in tactile, sensory choices (removing gloves, kneading ice) that align with her unique traits. Her internal conflict between contagion and connection is rendered through concrete action, not diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of gloves carries visible cost: years of isolation traded for transformation. Her emotional arc feels earned, specific, and inseparable from the story’s alchemical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her seventeen-year preparation and linguistic diplomacy reflect deep personal investment. Her internal conflict between technical precision and emotional vulnerability is embodied in trembling arms and resolute intent. However, her emotional progression lacks contradiction; she moves from determination to success without meaningful doubt or misstep. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but her micro-choices (e.g., dialect modulation) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly rendered through scientific-poetic metaphors, but her emotional state remains abstracted by diagnostic language (“synaptic plasticity,” “neurotransmitters”) that borders on therapy-speak during peak stress. Her motivation—to graft abandoned dreams onto her present self—is compelling but lacks concrete contradiction; she acts with near-omniscient control rather than struggle. The final choice feels earned thematically but not psychologically, as no tangible resistance or cost (beyond trembling hands) challenges her transformation. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, yet the single-POV execution remains coherent within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s prism-minded perception and embodied contradictions—gravity inversion felt in her stomach while boots stay anchored—create a vivid, consistent interiority. Her motivation (retrieving forgotten combinations) intensifies under pressure and aligns with her past actions (planting vigilance seeds). The final micro-choice—taking one seed for the next cycle—reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost: she sacrifices immediate resolution for future access. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain tactile and conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in her “symphonically minded” neurology and the world’s silence, driving every micro-choice with visceral specificity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile interaction with wood and porcelain. The final act—drawing sound from trauma via empathetic analysis—is earned by prior behavior and carries clear cost: centuries of solitude and the fragility of that first note. The hedgehog’s presence subtly externalizes her internal shift without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Castian’s interiority is richly embodied—his exile, regret, and evolving understanding of “difficult beauty” manifest through tactile micro-choices (thumb on dent, knight move) rather than exposition. His flaw (prioritizing precision over feeling) directly caused his fall and now shapes his redemption. The final renunciation isn’t victory but re-engagement, earned by seven years of silence recalibrated as density. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through magnetic hum, stone warmth, and twilight violet.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elio’s motivation is vividly rooted in his identity as an “eclectic pacifist” and his obsession with silence, driving his actions with theatrical sincerity that feels character-specific rather than performative. His internal conflict—between idealism and the violence of the world—is embodied through tactile choices (tuning frequencies, handling the diary) rather than abstract musing. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“to be a pacifist was not merely to refuse war…”) that borders on label-speak near the climax, slightly undercutting the earned quality of his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her olfactory sensitivity, ambition, and reverence for ancestral wisdom manifest in concrete choices (e.g., journaling, seed placement). Contradictory impulses coexist: she seeks serenity yet courts sensory suffering. Her final act of planting embodies earned endurance with visible cost. The grandmother’s doodles reveal intergenerational vulnerability, deepening motive without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—her scientific drive to uncover resilience grounds her actions. Her interiority is embodied (“stomach lurched,” “felt centuries… flood her consciousness”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice—to record the frequency rather than extract the artifact—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she must leave the source behind. However, internal contradiction is minimal; her resolve never meaningfully wavers, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent—her forensic pursuit of wind patterns to prevent future disasters stems from professional duty and personal reverence for Chen. Her interiority is embodied through sensory precision (e.g., pupils dilating in sulfur-lit clearings) and micro-choices like placing the patch as a marker. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward intellectualized resolve rather than visceral contradiction, missing deeper internal conflict under pressure. The final smile feels earned but borders on tidy given the horror context.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s synesthetic perception and urgent mission are vividly embodied, with micro-choices (e.g., positioning under the spire, responding to the amber sheet’s tremor) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her motivation—certifying wonder—is credible and intensifies under pressure. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we see determination but not competing impulses actively clashing. The final collapse shows cost, but the emotional struggle lacks a visible turning point where fear or doubt nearly overrides purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in guilt and the need for atonement, with embodied emotion (“teeth ache,” “trembling precision”) and micro-choices (arranging driftwood, uncasing the flute) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict—caution vs. action—is dramatized through the ghost-scape vision, not summarized. However, the epiphany about “guardianship as motion” borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting emotional rawness at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—quantifying empathy through typography—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with obsessive precision. Her internal contradiction (craving connection yet reducing souls to typefaces) intensifies under pressure, culminating in a morally ambiguous triumph. The cartographer’s disorientation is credibly rendered through sensory and perceptual collapse, though his interiority remains secondary to Elara’s design. Final cost—his erasure into another font—is chillingly earned, though his transformation borders on instrumentalization without deeper reciprocal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s jittery nature and observational sensitivity are embodied consistently, not merely labeled, and his transformation from anxious courier to wonder-tender is earned through micro-choices—especially his decision to extend the encounter with the archivist. His internal contradiction (fear vs. attentiveness) operates in-scene, and his final steadiness feels credible. The archivist, though brief, applies immediate pressure by recognizing the pendant, forcing Elias to articulate his mentor’s legacy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (gloves, pendant vibration, frozen soil).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her seventeen-year study grounds her actions in credible obsession. Her internal conflict between scientific rigor and mystical intuition manifests in micro-choices (e.g., not touching the window, using the prism). The final renunciation of skepticism is earned through tactile, sensory engagement rather than abstract epiphany. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; grief is observed, not wrestled with personally.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s motivation is crystalline—driven by maternal grief—and her internal conflict (perseverance vs. dissolution) manifests physically through bleeding fingers and tears that bind the weave. Her wistfulness hardens credibly into “translucent and terrible” resolve, and her final renunciation (unraveling herself into the tapestry) is earned by repeated sacrifice. The stoic amber bead acts as both emotional anchor and narrative constraint. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in loom work, blood, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s meekness and quiet determination are embodied through precise physical gestures—trembling fingers, unwavering shoulders—and her internal conflict manifests in the tension between her smith’s pragmatism and the mystical stakes of her quest. Her motivation is consistent and deepened by backstory (the Magus’s flight, the orchard’s ruin), yet her transformation feels earned rather than abrupt. The final renunciation of safety for possibility crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost: she descends alone, trades irreplaceable silk, and emerges empty-handed but purposeful. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority; emotion is filtered through forge-hammer rhythms and tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, curiosity, and moral reckoning unfold through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., choosing not to undo her mentor’s decision). Her motivation stems from a coherent professional identity and personal loss, and her final endurance (“Some burdens exist not to be lifted, but to be understood”) is earned through layered discovery. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions manifest through tactile detail (the shard dissolving into her palm) rather than abstraction. Her flaw—seeking truth at all costs—is tempered by wisdom, making her arc feel both individual and mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s reticence, warmth, and internal conflict are embodied through precise micro-choices—her refusal to send the letter, her careful cairn-building, her tactile engagement with silence. Her motivation (“to bottle the feeling of safety”) emerges from lived contradiction: she craves connection yet preserves anonymity. The final act—sealing the sea glass in wax instead of words—earns her renunciation with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through salt-cold ghosts, rust-bloomed stairs, and calloused hands.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—to shape a dawn textured with memory—is vividly embodied through tactile rituals (polishing the wick, whispering to glass) and emotionally charged contradictions: joy “heavy as ink,” laughter that prophesies. His micro-choices (initiating total internal reflection, releasing the beam at the critical moment) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preservation over oblivion. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he never wavers or doubts, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of struggle against his own role weakens the credibility of his “shadowed elation” as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dye master’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her borrowed heart, porous identity, and obsession with narrative adhesion feel lived-in, not conceptual. Her micro-choices (positioning the wing, tracking light) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over control, receptivity over performance. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding insight in tactile ritual (“mineral stain like dye in a fixing bath”). Her final release of the wing enacts Earned Stasis: she renounces possession to become a conduit, with cost legible in scar tissue and surrendered object.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in a yearning for communion with silent witnesses of grief, and her internal conflict—between preservation and release—is embodied in her cracked hands and ritualistic care. Her micro-choices (mapping dreams, pouring sorrow onto roots) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over control, participation over detachment. The final act of deconstruction feels earned, not epiphanic, and the cost—abandoning archival order for living reciprocity—is felt in the tactile shift from vial to root. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through precise, character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—rekindling a dying realm through woven memory—is vividly embodied in her swaddling of light and singing, revealing interior contradiction between desperate urgency and ritual precision. Her scattered consciousness manifests as multiple selves harmonizing, grounding abstract stakes in tactile action. The final coalescence into wholeness feels earned by prior micro-choices (e.g., protecting photons “as they germinated into actual warmth”). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through alchemical labor, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal conflict—compassion versus reclusiveness—is rendered with exquisite simultaneity, not alternation, and his final micro-choice (leaving the invitation) emerges organically from seventeen years of nested paradoxes. His empathy is embodied through sensory perception (“felt her loneliness radiate through the masonry”) rather than diagnostic labels. The cost of his renunciation—remaining unseen yet connected—is visible in his retreat into shadow, preserving his solitude while enabling another’s entry. His flaw (avoidance) directly shapes the resolution without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in her identity as a “creeping normality noticer”—drives every micro-choice, from smuggling compost to baking the relic bread into pudding. Her internal contradiction (grief for loss vs. faith in renewal) manifests in embodied actions: dirt-caked nails, whispered soil-talk, horn spoons. The final renunciation isn’t of loss but of passive mourning; she transforms absence into communal ritual with visible cost—the hardened loaf sacrificed, the garden exposed. Secondary characters apply quiet pressure through shared silence, not dialogue, reinforcing the story’s ethos of understated agency.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent: her “gently meticulous” precision under escalating urgency reveals a hierarchy of values—preservation through witness, not salvation. Her micro-choices (increasing sampling rate, documenting the child’s vow) dramatize her motivation without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—accepting emptiness while honoring measurement as love—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No head-hopping or stock phrasing; emotion arises through tactile detail (“trembling palms,” “urgency tightened her chest”).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “comforting unease,” the tremor in her father’s hands recalled mid-mission—and her micro-choices (feigning drunkenness, false starts) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation—to capture betrayal for her father—is consistent and intensifies credibly as stakes rise. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (the fob “warm against her palm”) and contradiction (playing lost while executing precision). However, the lieutenant and agent remain functional types rather than fully pressured relationships, slightly limiting crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her phosphorescent doubt, taste-based perception, and tactile relationship with the compass ring reveal a character shaped by her world’s logic. Her skepticism isn’t abstract but pulses as light and flavor, grounding her emotional arc in sensory specificity. The final transformation of doubt into function feels earned because it emerges from repeated micro-choices (turning the ring, tasting truth) under pressure. However, secondary characters remain archetypal (thunder-bearer, cyclone-bearer), serving thematic resonance over individuated motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—charcoal-fingered hands, mnemonic curse, auroral sorrow—and her contradictory impulses (performing vs. creating) drive micro-choices with escalating stakes. The child’s question catalyzes authentic motivation rooted in prior suffering, not epiphany. Her final act of repair and passage feels earned by accumulated frustration and precise recall. Minor deduction for slight diagnostic phrasing (“mnemonically gifted, a curse”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Aurelia’s motivation—recovering lost conversations to rebuild trust—is consistent, embodied through ink-stained fingers and gilded leaves that wilt with dishonesty. Her internal conflict (hope vs. despair) manifests in micro-choices: verifying marginalia twice, pressing trembling hands to glass. Marcus’s brief presence sharpens her resolve through relational pressure, not exposition. The final act—transcribing found truths—feels earned, with visible cost in years of searching and emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving “the color of wonder”—is embodied in every action, from hauling the iceberg fragment to calibrating bells with stiff fingers. Her seasonal muteness isn’t a label but a lived constraint that sharpens her perception and justifies her winter labor. The final release of the brake is a micro-choice charged with decades of renunciation, foreclosing any return to the wordless gray below. Her interiority avoids diagnostic abstraction, instead manifesting through tactile precision and emotional resonance with wind, metal, and ice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael-9’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile and sensory detail—the pulsing desert roses, the cradled box of fears—and its contradictory impulses (nostalgia vs. necessity, preservation vs. destruction) act simultaneously in scene. The android’s final choice to burn only the compromised quadrant emerges organically from established traits and prior causality, with visible cost: scarred dome, blackened earth, archived trauma. Emotional progression avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead rendering terror as “fragmenting thoughts into whirling snow” and resolution as “luminous and manageable.” The micro-choice to plant a cutting amid ashes crystallizes a hierarchy of values—regeneration over perfection—with nostalgic weight transformed into foundational strength.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation is consistent and embodied, especially in her restraint while following Mr. Alvarez—a micro-choice that honors her core belief in listening. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring concrete perception (“dust motes that swirled like a sandstorm frozen in time”). However, Mr. Alvarez’s grief, though moving, lacks contradictory impulses or internal friction; his role leans toward symbolic function over fully individuated character. The emotional climax hinges on his reaction, which feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to encrypt vulnerability as strength—is embodied in her dance, dice-rolling, and endurance, never abstracted. Her internal conflict between grief and duty manifests through precise physical choices (e.g., pirouettes translating shame), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of personal closure in favor of collective memory is earned by months of spider-like patience. No secondary characters dilute focus; her solitary arc carries full emotional and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—recovering lost memories—is rooted in trauma and rendered through concrete, embodied choices: her trembling hands, the coffee divination, urgent excavation. Her internal contradiction (hope vs. dread) manifests simultaneously in action and perception. The final revelation is earned by prior causality: the whale’s beaching, her nightly vigilance, the chamber’s logic. Cost is felt in the weight of recovered grief, not just sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner’s motivation—to silence a prophecy—is clear, consistent, and embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., releasing the crane as both surrender and command). Her internal conflict between cosmic duty and personal vulnerability is rendered through tactile, sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. The origami wing acts as an extension of her will, revealing hierarchy of values: preservation over power. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, and her emotional arc, while coherent, lacks a visible flaw that actively complicates her success—her competence borders on effortless, slightly undercutting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile interrogation of architecture reveals a yearning for connection with the inanimate, while Elias’s spectral presence forces micro-choices (borrowing sugar, pressing seals) that carry emotional and ontological cost. Their unspoken pact around “agreed upon lies” deepens character through restraint rather than exposition. The final act—pressing her own seal—shows credible endurance that forecloses a purely rational worldview, accepting haunting as fluency. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion lives in fingers, bricks, and meteor light.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—skepticism as armor against wonder—is embodied in precise, sensory-driven choices (e.g., singing the memory into storage while resisting its emotional pull). Her final realization about isolation vs. connection emerges from on-page pressure, not exposition, and her micro-choices (fingers dancing across crystal, voice shifting registers) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: solitude traded for compassionate vesselhood. The memory’s flashback forces her to confront her own self-imposed quarantine, making her transformation feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through action and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline: calibrated treason to sever vengeance through forgery. Her internal conflict—certainty vs. doubt, creation vs. destruction—is embodied in blood-ink mixing and thorn-pricking. The final renunciation (“unlinking herself from the burden of history”) is earned by seven years of endurance and precise moral calculus. No diagnostic label-speak; her flaws (isolation, guilt) directly shape her choices and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s richly perceptive trait is embodied through specific sensory awareness and micro-choices (e.g., positioning the shell at a precise angle), not just stated. Her internal conflict—between grief for her sister and moral outrage at nonconsensual encoding—is dramatized in simultaneous impulses: she seeks truth but recoils from exploitation. The final decision to “sing her sister home” crystallizes as Earned Stasis with visible cost: she accepts the burden of stewardship over vengeance or extraction. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in reed-blown voice and bare feet on sandstone.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—salvaging purity from historical wreckage—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and deepens under pressure. Her internal conflict between truth and fragility manifests in micro-choices: withholding the child’s survival, handling the snow globe with reverence. The ghost interaction reveals contradictory impulses—duty vs. mercy—without tidy resolution. Final renunciation (weaving truth carefully) is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly rendered through her tactile engagement with the net, whisk, and fireflies, embodying her philosophy rather than stating it. Her motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—is consistent and deepened by micro-choices (whistling through the whisk, pausing to study light in the mesh). The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her “demure audacity” emerges through action, not label. However, the lack of external pressure or contradictory impulses limits the depth of internal conflict expected at the 9.0+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—excavating truth from myth—is consistently embodied in her actions, from reassembling letters to confronting settlers. Her internal conflict between skepticism and the need for communal belief is subtly rendered, not summarized. The final choice to repair rather than debunk reflects a credible evolution grounded in prior causality. However, her emotional state under radiation burns and exhaustion lacks layered contradiction, slightly flattening the human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elian’s motivation—“variant allegiance”—is embodied in precise, contradictory impulses: he hungers for the prophet’s rise not to follow but to fracture reality. His loneliness is not stated but shown through ritual (mushroom-beard, radio static as companion), and his final act of seeding shadows carries tangible cost: perfect, hollow solitude. The micro-choice to whisper “counter-words” instead of joining or stopping the prophet crystallizes his hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in trembling beards and condensation trails.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—translating generational silence into auditory artifacts—is rooted in consistent, embodied flaws: his alcoholism, abandonment, and desperate yearning for connection. His internal contradiction (hoarding sounds yet needing to deliver them) manifests in micro-choices: opening specific jars, winding the music box, descending with the final jar. The emotional progression avoids therapy-speak; regret and joy coexist in “wistful joy that stung like honey.” His final act—leaving the loft—forecloses isolation with visible cost, earning the shift from hoarder to herald.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “logically emotional” nature is concretely embodied in her fusion of engineering precision and song, driving her climactic choice. Her internal contradiction—rigor versus vulnerability—operates simultaneously under pressure, not as alternating states. The final act of singing is earned by prior causality: her discovery of the blueprint, her repair work that broadcast the signal, and her ten-year history with the lighthouse. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through breath, pulse, and tactile resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “frantic anger” chipped into a “diamond-edged tool,” her heartbeat pounding yet boots unhurried—and her contradictions (wildness vs. discipline, urgency vs. patience) operate simultaneously under pressure. Her micro-choices (walking slowly, breathing deliberately) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: the six-minute window, the risk of atomic scatter. The backstory about predecessors killed by haste informs but doesn’t override present action; knowledge remains bounded and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, deliberate breaths, and conflicted reverence for Elias reveal a layered psyche under pressure. Her micro-choices (kneeling, photographing, sealing the lantern) reflect a hierarchy of values shifting from detached empiricism to moral witness. The flaw: Elias’s influence borders on archetype, lacking enough individuated contradiction to fully complicate Maya’s liberation. Still, her final resolve feels earned through concrete action, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and morally fraught, with embodied guilt (“confession hanging like dust motes”) and credible self-doubt. His micro-choices—placing his palm on the counter “as if taking an oath,” vowing apt deliberation—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The repairman functions effectively as secondary pressure, though slightly underdeveloped. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels authentic under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kip’s motivation—rooted in steady curiosity and yearning for the inaudible bell—is consistent, embodied, and escalates meaningfully through micro-choices like using the arrow tip to carve notation. Their internal contradiction (between irreverent awe and obsessive precision) manifests simultaneously in action and perception, not summary. The final act of aligning the cog is earned by centuries of patterned behavior, with visible cost in the shattered kaleidoscope and embedded arrow tip. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile interaction with tools and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to find where deleted files go—is consistent, personal, and drives her actions with escalating stakes. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers moved across holographic interfaces, brightly attentive to anomalies”) and embodied. However, the final broadcast lacks micro-choice tension; she acts with near-omniscient certainty, undercutting struggle. The astronauts’ survival revelation leans on convenient discovery rather than earned character-driven deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s “calmly intuitive” nature manifests through embodied micro-choices—positioning mirrors, tracing frames—not diagnostic labels. Her internal contradiction (empathy vs. duty) acts simultaneously in-scene, not as alternating summaries. The final reconfiguration is earned by prior causality: her history of mapping empathy onto action directly enables the third path. Flaws are genuine (reluctance to accept binary cruelty), and the cost—refusing passive mercy—is felt in the writhing shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is exquisitely concrete and contradictory—she seeks death yet probes debris with archaeologist’s care; her emotional detachment clashes with tactile engagement. The parasol tip becomes a vessel for lineage, not just memory, grounding her epiphany in embodied action. Final choice (to keep or cancel the appointment) feels earned through micro-choices: lifting the shoe, gripping the metal, turning from water. No therapy-speak; transformation arises from sensory immersion, not diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tracing of wood grain, brushing rust-colored leaves, pressing her hand to the earth—all reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in terroir and memory. Her final renunciation of waiting is earned through sustained reflection interwoven with micro-choices (smoothing the letter, deciding to mulch), not abstract epiphany. The “destined mismatch” philosophy reframes her grief without therapy-speak, preserving moral ambiguity: she accepts separation as maturation, not failure. One slight slip: the transition from resistance to acceptance leans slightly on Marcus’s remembered dialogue rather than fully dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line walker’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., spiraling approach, mask removal), revealing a hierarchy of values—humility over bravery, patience over confidence. Her “strangely honest” trait avoids diagnostic label-speak by manifesting in action, not assertion. However, the lack of internal contradiction—she never wavers or falters—edges toward idealized competence, slightly flattening emotional complexity. Still, her vulnerability during consecration earns the final renunciation with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a “subtle puzzle archivist,” and her internal arc—from seeking to transmute pain into a masterpiece to realizing the healing *is* the masterpiece—is credibly earned. Her perceptively calm demeanor functions as both trait and tactic, enabling communal trust without sentimentality. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves linearly from intent to revelation without visible struggle or misstep. The townspeople serve as reflective surfaces rather than crucibles, limiting relational pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reticence, scholarly devotion, and quiet awe are embodied through precise micro-choices—pressing the crystal to spines, tracing lichen-grammar—that reveal her internal contradiction: preservationist instinct vs. acceptance of linguistic decay. Her motivation is consistent and deepened by tactile engagement with the library’s transformation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through sensory action (“watching as the facets caught the murmur of shifting paper”). The final renunciation—placing the crystal rather than speaking—is earned and carries visible cost: surrendering control over meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to capture the sound of growing older—is visceral and embodied, rooted in his precognitive forgetting. His internal contradiction (clinging to echoes he cannot retain) drives every micro-choice, especially the chalk-writing frenzy. The flaw lies in slight over-reliance on abstract interiority (“tidal longing,” “acoustic shadow of entropy”) that risks diagnostic label-speak, though it’s mostly redeemed by physical anchors like chalk dust and driftwood. Final renunciation—drawing new arrows despite total amnesia—is earned, with clear cost: eternal recurrence without memory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to harness the ephemeral—is rooted in decades of tactile labor and emotional longing, made concrete through her stained fingers and chemical-scented memories. Her final choice to stay and restructure the camera, not flee, emerges from consistent interiority: a lifelong refusal to let light vanish unrecorded. The contradiction between her desire to capture and the inevitability of loss animates every micro-choice, culminating in the luminous ache of holding infinity only to release it. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany is embodied in hands adjusting lenses, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s white-knuckled grip on the vinyl shard and her shift from weapon to need reveal layered, embodied emotion without diagnostic labels. Elena’s “decisively kind” intervention—taking the shard, hymning the mundane—shows micro-choices that reconfigure relational dynamics under pressure. Mr. Hale’s lucid return feels earned, not convenient, and the final gesture of closing his fingers around the broken record carries credible emotional cost. All three characters remain flawed, specific, and constrained by their history, with no safety-hedging or epiphanies untethered from action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—her obsession with noon shadows drives her meticulous, high-stakes ritual. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers tracing sigils in the frost,” “whispering syllables”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of immediacy: she accepts a long vigil, foreclosing quick resolution with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction remains underdeveloped—desire for answers vs. fear of what they entail never fully collides in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elena’s motivation—forgiving skepticism—drives every choice with psychological precision, especially her refusal to destroy the changeling but instead “mend the fracture.” Her interior contradiction (rationalist yearning for constellations of error) manifests physically through bone-setting and emotionally through tactile interactions (tooth, silver wire). The changeling’s shrewd innocence forces micro-choices that reveal Elena’s hierarchy: mercy over certainty, repair over purity. Final renunciation—forgiving “us both for being wrong”—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of shattered epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal conflict—between her celestial past and earthbound penance—is rendered with embodied specificity: her polishing ritual, the cool weight of sea glass, the sublimation of fire into reflection. Her motivation is consistent, deeply rooted in guilt and transformation, and culminates in a credible renunciation of destructive power. The final choice—to become a prism, not a source—is earned through micro-choices (e.g., selecting angles, resisting memory-flame) that accumulate cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile ritual and spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, shame, and quiet agency manifest through tactile rituals (pressing moss into cracks, placing the pendant) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses—exposure vs. retreat, truth vs. context—are active in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation of public narrative for private reclamation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she abandons restitution for a slower, wordless healing. No therapy-speak; emotion arises through sensory engagement with decay and growth.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal conflict is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—trembling hands, lucid watchfulness, the tension between ending and witnessing. Her motivation (to collect “shapes of different hopes”) is consistent and deepened by specific micro-choices: kneeling, arranging cameos, pressing the shell into soil. The flaw lies in slight over-articulation of her epiphany (“not as possessions, but as offerings”), which edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it’s redeemed by the ritualistic action that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring sacred reciprocity with the land—is consistent, deeply rooted in generational loss, and embodied through her tinkerer-priestess duality. Her internal conflict (whimsy vs. solemn duty) manifests in micro-choices: discarding tools for ritual, trusting voice over mechanism. The final act of singing is earned by years of archival labor and emotional stakes tied to communal memory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (grease-smudged chronometer, pulsing vine).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate heartbeats into emotional cartography—is singular, consistent, and embodied through tactile ritual. Her internal conflict (precision vs. patience) manifests in glacial gestures and deliberate placement of failed materials, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation isn’t explicit but implied through earned stasis: she completes the map, accepts its cost, and aligns her breath with its rhythm. However, the absence of a second character or external pressure limits relational crucible testing, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly embodied in tactile, precise actions—filing gear teeth, tracking light angles—that reveal a deep internal conflict between reason and wonder. His competence is balanced by genuine struggle (e.g., trembling hands during reassembly), and his final choice to “store wonder in the cellar of reason” is earned through consistent micro-choices under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; emotion emerges through perception (“silvery distortions at the edge of sight”) rather than label-speak. His flaw—reliance on peripheral vision as both method and metaphor—shapes every decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and consistent, rooted in her role as fractal weaver, and her internal conflict—architect versus prisoner—is embodied through tactile actions like tracing calcified patterns with ungloved fingers. Emotions are rendered through sensory specificity (“whalebone reverie,” “leaden spheres”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her choices lack visible contradiction or trade-offs; she executes a ritual without resistance, limiting the depth of interior struggle. The final renunciation—enduring isolation to bear others’ sorrows—is credible but not dramatized as a hard-won decision.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief manifests through tactile ritual (carving, tea-making) rather than abstraction. Her micro-choices (aligning the blank, silencing the kettle, returning to the chisel) reveal a hierarchy of values: containment over catharsis, function over memorial. The “hauntingly practical precision” with which she retrieves her tools demonstrates earned endurance, not stoicism. Her contradiction—simultaneously holding absence and shaping utility—is sustained without resolution, making her final poise feel lived-in, not literary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her regret, eroded ambitions, and chronological confusion manifest in tactile choices (e.g., trembling hands offering the camera wheel). The ghost functions as a crucible, not a foil, forcing Mara to confront her own deferred self. Contradictory impulses—scavenger pragmatism vs. yearning for wholeness—act simultaneously in the climax. The final trade feels earned, with visible cost: Mara grows translucent as her past self solidifies.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation—puzzling out “new equations for hope”—is concretely embodied in her micro-choices: rerouting generators, salvaging hydroponics, using the sextant as a measuring tool. Her functional creativity isn’t named but demonstrated through tactile, high-stakes engineering decisions that foreclose the terminal’s original purpose while birthing a new one. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through precise action (“brushed the dust from her coveralls,” “knelt beside a discarded booth”). The final renunciation of departure-as-purpose is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of abandoning the spaceport’s intended identity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her grief for the abandoned pianist self wars with her scribe’s discipline, culminating in a renunciation that feels both inevitable and costly. The metronome functions as a precise extension of her psyche, and her micro-choices (not winding it, placing it gently) reveal hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory memory and tactile ritual. The final surrender is earned by seventeen years of solitude and one excruciatingly deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation evolves organically from treasure-hunting to truth-seeking, rooted in betrayal and intellectual hunger. Her internal conflict—between loyalty to her mentor and the need to dismantle his lies—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., tactile sundial reading) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation of external validation for self-authored meaning is earned by prior causality: every false map trained her perception. Flawless integration of blind spot (trusting mentor) and competence (instinctive navigation) makes her transformation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve storm-calming techniques—is embodied through tactile, ritualized action rather than exposition. His “infinitely patient” trait manifests in micro-choices: kneeling, tracing knots without force, retying the final knot exactly. The fisherman functions as a silent pressure point, not a crucible, limiting relational depth, but Elias’s internal hierarchy of values (preservation over possession) is clear and costly. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in snow-compression, joint-stiffness, and glass-warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief manifests through tactile rituals (winding the thread, summoning scent and breath) rather than diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (to mourn vs. to map absence) act simultaneously during the projection scene, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses romantic hope with visible cost: solitude, an empty harbor, a missing thread. The final choice—to wear the thread as a tether—is earned by his method and consistent with his role as cartographer of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prince Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in his obsession with lost organic beauty, and his internal contradiction—between scientific rigor and poetic yearning—is embodied in tactile detail (e.g., tears hissing on coils). However, his emotional arc leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“bitterly sweet weight of possibility”) that edges toward label-speak, though it’s partially redeemed by physical consequence. His final endurance feels earned, but the cost—raising a bird in an iron world—is implied more than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her scars, profession, and trauma converge in micro-choices (e.g., pressing kelp to numb skin) that reveal contradictory impulses: aversion to fire yet devotion to renewal. Her motivation—to prove scars can “sing”—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies through action, not exposition. The final grafting act earns her transformation with visible cost: enduring vulnerability to reclaim sensation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile, sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, her “luminous skepticism” embodied in action rather than stated. Her realistically imaginative mind informs precise choices (e.g., pressing the correct star). Internal contradiction is subtle but present—she doubts official history yet trusts mica breadcrumbs and celestial mechanics. The final renunciation of the box feels earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: to share light without fire. Her internal conflict—between generational repetition and transformative renewal—is embodied in tactile choices (handling the gear, pressing it into the nebula’s heart). The final dispersal into luminescence feels earned, not sentimental, with visible cost: she sacrifices individual form for collective illumination. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany arises from sensory interaction with the gear and petals.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief is tactile, woven into silk and stone—and his “fiercely meditative” trait manifests in micro-choices (e.g., matching breath to vent rhythm). His motivation—to map collective grief—is consistent, flawed, and deepened by spectral mentorship. The grandmother’s presence pressures without resolving, preserving Elias’s agency. Final renunciation (carving silence, not just names) is earned through prior struggle and carries visible cost: winter solitude, shortened ribbon, abandoned search for geometric closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in ethical diligence and decades of penitent calculation; his internal conflict between pride and precision manifests in embodied choices (e.g., tracing inscriptions while adjusting the screw). The rake handle functions as both ledger and compass, grounding his redemption in tactile ritual. His final act—leaving the tool behind—signals earned stasis with visible cost: forty years of solitude distilled into a single calibrated turn. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through micro-movements and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—to discover the “shape of intentions”—is credibly rooted in her actions and environment, and her internal conflict (curiosity vs. inherited silence) manifests through tactile, embodied choices. Her emotional arc avoids therapy-speak, instead revealing itself through precise gestures: folding the tapestry, recognizing thorns “by name.” The final realization—that her gardening is part of a sonic architecture of grief—feels earned by prior behavior, not imposed. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in-scene (her resolve never wavers) prevents full 9+ status.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete sensory details (kingfisher quill, glacier sapphire ink) and embodied contradictions—she is both cartographer and creator, constrained yet imaginative. Her motivation—to seed innovation within rigid limits—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final act of writing feels earned by her prior labor and philosophy. However, the absence of interpersonal friction or externalized conflict slightly flattens emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to resurrect narrative through music and dust—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: his luminous mind, ink-stained fingers, and ritualistic copying. His internal conflict between secrecy and transmission manifests in micro-choices (embedding lyrics in scores), and his endurance carries visible cost: isolation, obscurity, labor without recognition. The final image of him “still luminous beneath his ordinary skin” crystallizes an Earned Stasis that forecloses fame or validation but affirms purpose. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—crystallizing his mother’s fleeting emotion through ash and porcelain—is embodied in every micro-choice, from scattering charcoal to wearing the mask. His internal conflict between preservation and destruction is rendered through tactile, character-specific perception (“charcoal powder clung to his fingers, black and irreducible”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final act of placing the mask on the chair enacts Earned Stasis: he forecloses reunion but secures memory, with visible cost in seventeen years of isolation. No unmotivated epiphanies; grief degrades his cognition believably under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “abrasive calm,” tactile engagement with the cog, and agonized calculus reveal a mind wrestling with truth under pressure. His motivation (preserving precision against myth) intensifies credibly into rebellion through micro-choices: drinking foul water, sketching gear ratios despite flood risk. The final decision emerges from layered contradictions—ego vs. duty, rationality vs. survival—not tidy epiphany. Cost is felt in his isolation and the councils’ looming power.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his “expectantly resigned reverence” and bone-deep recognition of “traveled stillness” reveal a lifetime of struggle without diagnostic self-awareness. Each student’s micro-choice (the miner’s daughter omitting sharp notes, the refugee singing in silence) stems from specific, contradictory impulses rooted in their histories. Their transformation feels earned, not epiphanic, and the cost of failure—“the noise of permanent division”—is viscerally present. The only slight flaw: the refugee’s arc leans slightly more on implication than dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her sensory gift and exhaustion from absorbed trauma, compelling her high-stakes act of neural pruning. Her internal conflict—between carrying others’ grief and creating new life—is embodied through taste and memory rather than abstract therapy-speak. The final choice to serve the fruit at the banquet is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she has shed part of herself to make space. However, the absence of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness is not merely stated but actively constrains his choices, culminating in a high-stakes revelation that carries tangible risk. His internal conflict—between institutional silence and poetic fidelity—is embodied in tactile details (amber resin, vibrating bee) and micro-choices (preserving the drone, handing over the matchbox). The engineer’s reaction validates his stance without flattening moral ambiguity. Final renunciation of corporate erasure is earned through consistent, character-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through her perceptual idiosyncrasies—her noticing of “creeping normality” isn’t abstract but embodied in micro-choices (trailing fingers on fence posts, pressing orris root to siding). Her motivation—to understand why houses feel alive—is dramatized through action, not declaration, and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses passive observation: she becomes a participant, consecrating the boundary between architecture and entity. The cost is felt in the cottage’s shiver of recognition and the altered configuration of objects, implying irreversible entanglement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory precision and restrained gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Corvin’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—granite wrists, calcified fingers, telepathic silence—and his contradictory impulses (mercy vs. judgment, statue vs. midwife) act simultaneously rather than sequentially. His micro-choice to shatter the ampoule through the fissure, not ceremony, reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: the petrified certainty of the garden must fracture to live. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, geological metaphor. The final renunciation of binary truth is earned by prior doubt and aligns perfectly with his incisively kind nature.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s grim optimism and internal conflict are embodied with visceral specificity—her bleeding nails, phantom palm, and mathematical defiance reveal a psyche under pressure. Her final choice to abandon observation is earned by prior causality: her refusal to descend, her reliance on the dice, and her obsession with the missed door. The chipped die functions as both object and psychological mirror, grounding her flaw in tangible detail. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in embodied insomnia and intergenerational duty, with micro-choices (painting specific extinct words) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—desperate hope versus exhaustion—is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. The visions she receives are filtered through tactile, emotional specificity (saffron quiet, turmeric in milk), avoiding abstraction. Final renunciation (setting down the brush at dawn) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: thirty-seven sleepless hours.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“rosewater dread,” “trembling hands”) and micro-choices (pressing the opera glass, assembling bread initials) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to rescue dying arts—is credibly rooted in her role as guardian and intensifies under pressure. However, her epiphany about the bread map arrives with minimal internal friction or contradictory impulse, leaning slightly toward unearned insight. The elders’ resistance is noted but not dramatized as a crucible that tests her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—escaping biological determinism—is rooted in consistent traits (“neatly inventive precision”) and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict (desire for control vs. terror of uncertainty) acts simultaneously in scene, embodied in tactile actions like winding the mainspring and mounting the stone. The final renunciation of fate is earned by decades of obsessive work, with visible cost: vanishing from linear time. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through precise physicality (“bleak exhilaration flooding her chest”).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, self-loathing, and paradoxical yearning for punishment are rendered through tactile sensations (the cold clasp, humming camera) and morally fraught micro-choices. Her confession isn’t a tidy epiphany but a raw, self-annihilating act that aligns with her lifelong pattern of using destruction as control. The whispering advisor functions as externalized conscience, not a plot device, heightening the crucible without diluting Mara’s agency. Her final renunciation—unpinning the clasp—is earned by the causal chain of her buried crime and photographic curse.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prophet’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is embodied through consistent, character-specific actions and micro-choices under pressure, especially in her rhythmic engagement with the storm. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through physical ritual (e.g., striking wood while interpreting clouds). The final act of coronation demonstrates credible endurance with felt cost: she remains restless despite resolution, affirming her identity as perpetual translator. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; desire dominates without palpable counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s quietly driven nature manifests as embodied contradiction—measured hands masking feverish determination—and culminates in a final choice that forecloses mapping in favor of participation. Her micro-choices (arranging shells, blowing the whistle) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: sacrificing isolation for transcendence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead filtering perception through profession and obsession. The lost expedition’s fate reframes her motivation without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is precise, embodied, and morally complex—her “emotionally rational” calculus feels earned through micro-choices like tracing the ivy border or typing her reply while watching the wren. Her motivation intertwines personal ethics with historical duty without therapy-speak. The contradiction between understanding Ashford’s mercy and rejecting his lie fuels every action. Final renunciation of silence carries visible cost: she bears the weight of truth alone, yet unflinching.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s stoic sensitivity and archaeologist-of-dreams motivation are embodied through precise micro-choices—brushing silt from a toy horse, straining against rusted hinges—that reveal her internal contradiction: professional detachment warring with profound empathy. Her emotional state is rendered through tactile, sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels, and her final act of sealing a note into the foundation carries visible cost. The backstory of the architect’s drowned fiancée is not exposition but a discovered theory, integrated into her present action. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her perception degrades appropriately under cold and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—his pursuit of “honest origins” drives every action, and his internal conflict between imposed order and emergent complexity feels earned. His “tranquilly perceptive” trait informs his observations without veering into diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice—to restructure the catalog around parallel validities—emerges logically from prior evidence and carries conceptual cost: abandoning a singular archival truth. However, the emotional stakes remain intellectualized; the human weight of drowned ownership is implied but not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation—folding grief into crystalline cranes—is deeply embodied through micro-choices (selecting specific gems, grinding them with decades of unconscious preparation) and contradictory impulses (descending while ascending). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering sorrow as tactile labor. The final renunciation—releasing the cranes and dispersing herself—is earned by her lifelong practice and personal losses, with visible cost in her translucent hands and empty workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amara’s motivation is rooted in visceral loss and intellectualized grief, with micro-choices (e.g., pressing the geode to the console) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak, instead embodying contradiction through tactile focus and mathematical obsession. The final renunciation—hunting residue, not revenge—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: isolation, time pressure, and physical risk. However, her emotional state borders on over-articulated abstraction in “unfiltered awakening,” slightly flattening the rawness expected mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—decoding his grandmother’s life work—is consistent and emotionally grounded, with micro-choices (e.g., straining to pull the lever) revealing hierarchy of values. His “perpetually surprised” expression is embodied early and resolves meaningfully at closure. Internal conflict between longing for belonging and fear of failure simmers beneath actions without over-articulation. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy in the epiphany, lacking irrational contradiction that would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied in raw hands, trembling fingers, and the weight of the watch hand—never abstracted into therapy-speak. His motivation—to measure the mass of stolen truth—is consistent, morally complex, and culminates in a credible renunciation (bearing witness, not seeking redemption). The final choice to arrange the carvings and seek the daughter feels earned by his prior complicity and current penance. No safety-hedging: he remains flawed, his crime irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The negotiator’s interiority is vividly embodied—her counting of lightning, her ritual with the drawer pull, and the warmth of the key against her ribs all reveal a mind shaped by trauma and precision. Her “uncommon thoughtfulness” isn’t stated but enacted through micro-choices: timing the exchange to lunar phases, using the brass pull as both signal and talisman. The final act of placing the object in the scout’s hand crystallizes her renunciation of cyclical violence with visible cost—she remains alone, bearing the weight of memory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his merrily melancholic hum clashes with the weight in his chest, revealing contradiction without therapy-speak. His micro-choices (clutching the compass, following poles) align with his renunciation of celestial navigation. The flaw of hubris feels earned, and his final act of leaving the compass carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—kindling empathy in a hollowed self—is viscerally embodied through micro-choices (e.g., failing tableaus, then weeping at the lake) that reveal her internal contradiction: a weapon seeking softness. Her emotional progression avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing degradation under stress (“crushing guilt,” “hollow ache”) and culminating in earned vulnerability. The final renunciation of numbness is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost (tears for victims she now sees as human). Flawless interiority fused to action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between reluctance and devotion—is rendered with embodied specificity (“trembling in her chest, her hands unwavering”) and sustained through the metamorphosis. Her motivation is rooted in a concrete, emotionally charged backstory (the cookie fortune, her sister’s death) that compels high-stakes action. The final renunciation—accepting permanent stasis—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. However, the sister’s late appearance slightly flattens the crucible dynamic, limiting reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her blood on the saucer, trembling fingers at her sternum—and her contradictory impulses (desire to reclaim time vs. surrender to its transformation) operate simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation is earned through micro-choices: pressing the crack, tracing her daughter’s future hands, unfastening memory rather than ribs. Her flaw—resenting lost time—is confronted with tangible cost: carrying “forgiveness of its passage, heavy as a stone.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises from sensory specificity and ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between pacifism and suppressed rage—is rendered with concrete, embodied contradiction (“unacknowledged rage at being helpless”) and evolves through micro-choices (meditation, confronting complicity). His final act is earned by decades of integration, not epiphany. However, the absence of on-page interaction limits relational crucible testing, and “therapy-speak” like “shadow work” slightly flattens emotional rawness in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his poverty, anonymity, and quiet agency feel earned through tactile detail (“frayed edges,” “empty pockets making him light enough”). His motivation—to understand transformation’s texture—emerges organically from decades of unseen philanthropy. However, the final epiphany (“giving everything away had been the only way to keep it”) borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient micro-choice friction in the climax. The contradiction between orchestrating coincidences and passive surrender lacks a decisive internal struggle in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in her role as sentinel, with micro-choices (e.g., counting steps, aligning the quill) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority is concrete (“calmly inventive grace,” “heartbeat of the coming change”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, the absence of internal contradiction—she executes flawlessly without hesitation or doubt—limits emotional complexity. The final act feels earned but lacks the friction of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The eel herder’s motivation—decades of fidelity to a dying astronomer’s request—is rendered with visceral specificity and sustained through embodied action (eel-slime boots, stone placement). His precognitive curse isn’t just stated; it burns “like collapsed star dust,” driving micro-choices that culminate in self-annihilation. Interior contradiction is implicit: he seeks understanding yet knows it will unmake him. The final step into the field feels earned, not fated, with cost etched into every prior gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her tremor, ink-stained fingers, and breath fogging glass fuse physicality with legacy. Her motivation (to map silences of lineage) intensifies through micro-choices: handling the timer, interpreting the negative, sealing the new manuscript. The final renunciation of silence for testimony is earned by prior causality and bears visible cost—seventy-three pages written in storm-lit isolation. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (furious tranquility, rage and peace) pulse through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s mechanical arm and philosophical drive cohere into a singular, embodied worldview; his micro-choices (e.g., aligning the needle card with the sundial under duress) reveal a hierarchy of values. Silas’s “diplomatically fierce” composure functions as credible pressure, not caricature. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses—Aldric’s resolve feels untroubled mid-duel, missing the irrationality or self-deception expected under stress. The final token exchange reads as earned, but the emotional cost lacks visceral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his transient identity versus his urgent need to preserve resistance—are embodied in tactile details (coffee tin, loosening skin) and micro-choices (pressing the rose embossment). Marcus’s grounded presence sharpens Elias’s stakes without flattening either man into archetype. The molting condition is not just stated but felt as a visceral pressure that narrows options. However, Elias’s internal conflict occasionally leans on diagnostic phrasing (“the penny poet who wrote verses…”) that edges toward label-speak, slightly softening the rawness expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “steely longing” manifests in precise, tactile actions (rewinding film, adjusting metronome) rather than abstract reflection. Her contradictory impulses—grief versus defiance, memory versus invention—operate simultaneously in scene, especially when she plays unpracticed chords “drawn from hidden sections of memory.” The final choice to persist, not escape, is earned through prior causality: her modifications to the piano and projector demonstrate sustained agency. Cost is visible in the three-year delay of the clock’s chime and the trembling station foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in protecting cultural memory, and her internal conflict—balancing empirical rigor with “luminous doubt”—drives micro-choices like planting the seed and singing modulated songs. Her embodied emotions (pollen on eyelids, feeling the ridge tremor) avoid diagnostic labels. The final endurance (“beauty was its own form of truth”) feels earned through prior struggle. However, the dream-grandmother interaction borders on convenient epiphany without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her slow speech, pruning gestures, and tactile engagement with lace and compass reveal grief as a physical rhythm. Her contradictory impulses (avoidance vs. seeking) act simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The final choice—to reinterpret pruning as release—is earned through micro-decisions (handling the compass, reading the lace) that reconfigure her relationship to loss. However, Elias remains a ghostly construct; without on-page interaction, the relational crucible lacks reciprocal pressure, limiting full motivation depth.
