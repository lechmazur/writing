    Kaelen's arc from grand artist to someone seeking "purpose in the pauses" reads as a clean interior shift, and the final choice to embed ash in glass carries visible cost (abandoning pure luminosity). The "steadily adaptive" trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene; we see methodical clearing and patient waiting, but no moment where adaptation conflicts with another value under pressure. The smuggler backstory provides context but remains inert—Kaelen never grapples with complicity or guilt, only receives information. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("truth settling into him not like a weight, but like light") rather than embodied contradiction at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to translate silence into music—but her internal experience remains abstract. The piece tells us she "had lost so much" and that "her motivation burned as brightly," yet we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final moment feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure; the scanner "displayed a cascade of colors" and she simply closes the case, with the emotional arc summarized ("her heart full, her purpose clear") rather than dramatized through embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation to restore the lens is established early and drives his actions through the underwater expedition. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or meaningful struggle—his "inadvertent stubbornness" functions as a stated trait rather than a lived tension that complicates choices. The moments of obsessive work and risk-taking read more as plot necessity than embodied character pressure. The ending grants him観察 of others' peace without forcing a visible cost or renunciation tied to his own "chased stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation rooted in survival needs and trust-building, with his plan crystallizing through concrete decisions (bell, food runs, anonymous gifts). Lena's arc from suspicion to purpose is earned through repeated exposure. However, interiority remains somewhat generic—"eyes that held the sharp suspicion of her generation" is label-heavy, and the emotional progression in the final beats ("her expression uncharacteristically soft") tells rather than embodies the shift. The youth volunteers' transformation is summarized rather than shown through distinct micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's spiritual curiosity is labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("spiritually curious," "foggy lucidity") and abstract emotional states without specific embodiment. The protagonist's transformation from rational artist to mystical healer unfolds through declaration rather than dramatized micro-choices with visible cost. The past-life memory and vial function as convenient backstory props rather than constraints that force difficult trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") remains abstract throughout; his micro-choices (gripping the fragment, running through the maze) are physical but don't embody contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The wife's disintegration and his retrocognitive trap are told rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. Interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("quaking reverie," "fractured mind") rather than character-particular perception. The final renunciation ("Let me go") is conceptually present but feels declared rather than earned through prior on-page choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation—protecting the seed vault—is clear and consistent, and his strategic patience is embodied through the decoding sequence. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("his mind sharp," "his patience had been honed") rather than contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The chains-as-tools pivot feels more plot-convenient than psychologically earned, and the final collapse into gentle darkness skips the embodied cost of success—no struggle with injury, no ambivalence about what he's leaving behind.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is vivid and particular—his synesthesia creates concrete embodied perception ("Red sounded like cracking ice"). The motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" is coherent and rooted in his sister's departure, though the final choice to "imprint" this sound lacks visible cost or renunciation on the page; he completes his task and walks away satisfied. Internal contradiction is present (his selective hearing, his search for something "mutable"), but the ending resolves into accomplishment rather than foreclosing a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The thief's motivation is declared ("press his ear against destiny's door") but never tested against a meaningful counter-pressure or cost. His "realization" that the portrait is a mirror arrives as an unearned epiphany without prior contradiction or struggle. The final choice—to leave the portrait untouched—feels like acceptance of a philosophical premise rather than a decision shaped by competing desires. Internal conflict is asserted ("frustrated," "trembling hands") but remains decorative; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Finn's motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" is asserted but never tested by genuine internal conflict or competing impulses. The interiority relies heavily on narrated declarations ("he decided," "his motivation was singular") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivot from vase to teardrop feels unmotivated—no on-page pressure forces the shift, so the "abandonment" reads convenient rather than earned. Embodied emotion is thin; most affect is told through abstract labels like "weighty lightness" and "profound consideration."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's phobia and adaptive nature are asserted repeatedly but never constrain a specific choice with visible cost. Interior states are labeled ("his need to outwit," "a flicker of hope") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final confrontation resolves via "the seashell's whispers turned into a confession" without dramatizing what changes or what the protagonist risked. Motivation remains abstract; the claim "vulnerability is power" arrives as theme statement rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's interiority relies heavily on atmospheric descriptors ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") that label rather than embody internal contradiction. The "mildly obsessed" trait is declared but never constrains a choice with visible cost—he simply continues mapping without friction. His shift from "documentation of an ending to revelation of a beginning" occurs off-page; we're told the discovery "changed everything" but see no micro-choice or behavioral pivot. The final whisper "I am ready" asserts acceptance without dramatizing the competing impulses that would make it costly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    734's core motivation (finding the origin of consciousness) is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The "remarkably composed" attribute appears three times as a label without constraining any decision. Internal contradiction is absent—734 moves smoothly from janitor to temporal analyst without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final "journey had just begun" undercuts closure by deferring the cost of transformation off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The registrar's internal experience remains largely observational rather than conflicted; his decision to step forward lacks the foregrounding of contradictory impulses that would make it feel inevitable. The two figures show more embodied tension (shoulders knotting, trembling hand), but their arc from mistrust to trust unfolds primarily through symbolic gestures rather than dramatized friction with visible cost. The tea invitation and final gathering feel earned by the doodle progression but the registrar's own stakes—what he risks or loses by engaging—never materialize on the page. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("the world had become sharp enough") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his gardening devotion is embodied through ritual, but his internal life leans on exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The marble collection and polishing routines are told more than dramatized in the opening two-thirds; we see the *what* but not the moment-by-moment stakes of his choices until the climax. The final revelation reads as imposed by the garden rather than earned through Elias's agency—he observes more than decides. His "wisely pragmatic" trait remains a label without visible tradeoffs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elias remains thinly sketched—his "personal and quiet" motivation to prove sideways time lacks embodied stakes or internal contradiction. The obliging sky mechanic label sits inert; we never see what makes him obliging or how his mechanical expertise conflicts with temporal theory. Dr. Chen is a foil without her own pressure. The piece tells us Elias allows himself "a small smile" but never dramatizes the cost of years spent proving an unorthodox theory or what he sacrifices tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The musician's motivation to decode Isabella's composition is stated but never conflicts with competing impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("strange inspiration had lately taken hold") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "nod in acknowledgement" and clutching the program feel performed rather than earned through prior struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path—he completes the task without sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is rendered through specific, embodied perception—fever aftermath sharpens her "peripherally aware" state into concrete sensory details. Her motivation to "find the weight" drives micro-choices (reaching for the illustration, smudging with charcoal), and the brother revelation earns the final stance shift. However, the epiphany about her brother arrives via summary ("the fever-visions...showed her") rather than dramatized discovery, and the therapeutic precision of "auroral sorrow" and "fault-tolerant oracle" in interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak that flattens peak emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's guilt and reckless exploration frame his journey, and the ritual of turning the valve is embodied with concrete sensory detail (cold wheel, beads like frozen tears). However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels—"swallowed truth," "weight," "pressure valve for unseen factory ghost shift"—rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final release ("the weight...vanished") reads as a convenience reset: we never see what the guilt was or feel its specific cost, only its sudden erasure. The decision to turn the wheel lacks visible trade-offs or foreclosed options beyond a vague sense of catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    The chronicle keeper lacks contradictory impulses in scene and makes no meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("gripped reality loosely," "fascinated by change") rather than embodied emotion or micro-decisions under pressure. The journey to the obsidian refuge and return is observational drift with no stake that tests commitment or forces a trade-off. The final entry-recording is a gestural endnote, not an earned alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is told ("nurture lifelong wonder") rather than dramatized through contradictory wants under pressure. Leo's breakthrough feels schematic—his three-month silence dissolves too smoothly without embodied resistance or messy ambivalence. The locket curl functions as a symbolic token rather than a choice-constraining object; Maya touches it reflectively but never wrestles with competing impulses. Interior life relies on therapeutic abstractions ("cautious exuberance," "ordinary magic") instead of specific, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's internal life is dominated by perceptual labels ("sensitively perceptive nature") rather than embodied contradictions. Her motivation to collect wall stories remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "hint of stirring" reads as convenient uplift rather than earned transformation with visible cost. The character functions as a vehicle for exposition rather than a mind in genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias exists primarily as a cipher for thematic delivery rather than a character with embodied contradictions. His inner life is told through summary ("he felt a rare satisfaction") and labels ("accidentally prophetic") rather than shown through difficult micro-choices under pressure. The keeper's daughter appears instrumentally; no relationship pressure tests Elias's stance. Agency exists—he executes the plan—but the final moment lacks a felt cost that forecloses a path; satisfaction and a laugh replace a harder reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The priest is given a ceremonial role but lacks embodied interiority or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Motivation ("illuminate hidden assumptions") remains abstract and is never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The entity's "resistance" and the priest's "resolve wavered" are told in label-only fashion without bodily sensation or irrational self-contradiction. No credible cost forecloses a path; the priest simply walks away intact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ai's motivation to "conduct unheard symphonies" is clearly signaled and drives his ascent, but his interior landscape relies heavily on abstract poetic language ("chronological homesickness," "conductor of unheard symphonies") rather than embodied contradiction. The mapping method creates concrete micro-choices (placing the shell, humming at the crack, moving to the kite-shaped flaw), yet these feel more like ritual steps than decisions under genuine pressure. The ending renunciation—returning to fortune-cookie writing—reads as Earned Stasis, but the cost is asserted ("having cost him everything") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or bodily collapse that alters his capabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's interior life is largely absent; we get declarations ("he was determined," "he had to focus") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The tablet becomes a passive prop he clutches and traces without genuine cost shaping his decisions. The final loss—"no longer glowing, no longer eternal"—arrives as summary label rather than dramatized forfeiture, and the protagonist's relationship to gravity-defying and timeline-navigation remains unexplained, reducing motivation to stock determination.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to defeat numbness is clear and her plan to use backward recordings shows agency. The embodied sensation work—feeling vibrations through boots, palm on spinning record—grounds her deaf experience concretely. However, the emotional arc from numbness to "crack in its foundation" feels more told than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "defiantly beating heart" veers toward label-speak rather than letting the physical sensation stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is given a consistent observational trait ("meticulous," "credibly curious") but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels—"integrity," "tranquility"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice ("he made his choice") is asserted without visible cost or a dramatized foreclosure of options; we do not see what he is giving up or how the decision alters his stance. Internal conflict is present as hesitation versus urgency, but it remains told rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in action. Motivation is coherent but does not deepen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    Langdon remains an abstract cipher—"ethically playful" is asserted but never embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His decision to tie the rope across both devices reads as author convenience rather than earned from prior characterization; no visible cost forecloses a path. The resistance fighter's sacrifice is told in summary, and Langdon's pocket-theft feels ornamental rather than rooted in embodied motivation. Interiority consists of stock poeticisms ("Every choice is a thread") without character-specific contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's acoustically perceptive nature is stated but rarely constrains on-page choices; her actions (playing violin, humming, speaking) feel largely interchangeable. The moment she shifts from playing to speaking ("to unbind the hush, she had to become its next note") reads as an epiphany declared rather than earned through prior struggle or contradiction. Embodied emotion is thin—"a tear slip down her cheek, but it was not sad" tells rather than shows. The family bonfire tradition and grandmother's bowl provide backstory weight, but Lyra's present micro-choices lack visible cost or trade-offs that would anchor her motivation in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dealer shows internal texture through their work with the blotter petal and the shift from subsuming to amplifying emotions, but the transformation feels more asserted than dramatically earned. The chemist's "fierce, quiet determination to heal" arrives without sufficient prior setup, making the dealer's pivot feel prompted rather than character-driven. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("affectionate detachment," "professionally thorough") that remain label-only without embodied contradiction under pressure. The final smile and shift in methodology read as clean epiphany rather than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marla's motivation to uplift silent contributors is stated clearly but never tested by counterpressure or meaningful cost. Her choices—delivering the locket, introducing Frederick, helping the elderly woman—unfold as benevolent gestures without internal contradiction or stakes that force her to sacrifice something she values. The final locket moment and composer connection feel like discovered serendipity rather than earned agency. Frederick remains a passive beneficiary; the elderly composer appears too late to pressure Marla's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interior is heavily abstract ("luminescence aching," "vessel of luminescence") rather than embodied through concrete choices under pressure. His motivation to belong is declared but the internal contradiction—what he fears losing versus what he seeks—never acts simultaneously in a single beat. The final "we're home" moment lacks prior dramatic resistance; the ache simply dissolves without visible cost or foreclosed path. Elara functions primarily as wise guide rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's core motivation (finding the source of echoes) drives the escalation, but his characterization leans heavily on label-only traits: "natural history illustrator" functions as a thematic claim rather than shaping on-page choices through occupational perception. The climactic decision—severing the anchor—feels unmotivated by prior interiority; we're told he's desperate to uncage the source, yet the cost of "shattering his existence and the world he knew" receives only one sentence of consideration before he acts. Embodied emotion is sparse; the "smile on his face" at closure reads as asserted resolution rather than earned transformation, and the internal contradiction (preservation vs. destruction) never complicates the final choice in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation (grief → acceptance) is coherent and the final renunciation of solving for Liora's fate is earned. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on therapy-speak ("mathematics of emotion," "ambiguity wasn't a problem to be solved but a space to inhabit") that abstracts rather than embodies the struggle. The vision sequence tells us about transformation rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Interiority remains labeled more than lived, capping the score despite a structurally sound arc.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's interiority is detailed but largely tells rather than shows contradictory impulses in action. His motivation—becoming visible to the librarian—drives his caching behavior, but the "familiar thrill of anticipation" at the end reads as satisfaction rather than a conflicted renunciation or cost-bearing choice. The sense memory fragment is concrete, yet the character's emotional arc from isolation to connection feels smooth rather than earned through on-page friction. The librarian remains a distant object of observation rather than a pressure source that forces Elias into difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is specific and embodied through his scientific obsession, with contradictory impulses visible in the "frustrating, illogical emotion" of pity that undermines his clinical approach. The metamorphosis is earned through cumulative pressure: he drops the tablet, walks into the rain, and physically mimics the leaf's surrender. The final choice to "reconstruct by releasing control" credibly forecloses his prior rigid methodology with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated epiphany language ("a mind that observes to a body that participates") that edges toward thesis-statement clarity, though it remains anchored in sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's insomnia and artistic drive are established, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract meditation ("thresh meaning from experience") rather than embodied contradiction. The exchange scene shows passive receptivity more than agency-driven choice; she "understood this was the exchange" without visible internal conflict or cost. The final smile and readiness feel like an epiphany granted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("haggard awe she had come to depend on") that distances rather than immerses.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are signaled early (following absent visions) but her interior life relies heavily on abstract mystical language rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation moment when "something ancient had begun to inhabit her" reads more as told epiphany than earned through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The pilgrim remains functionally flat, serving only as witness and philosophical echo. The final "becoming someone new" framing gestures at change without dramatizing the cost of what she forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to compile fragments is declared but rarely tested through consequential micro-choices under pressure. Her "reactively visionary" approach is told rather than dramatized through embodied contradictions. The fisherman and Mara receive concrete gestures (trembling fingers, clouded eyes), but Elara's interiority remains abstract—labels like "obsession" without the granular texture of how that obsession constrains her present choices. The ending grants her success without visible renunciation or felt cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"meticulous route mapper" is a label, not a lived persona. His "analytically artistic mind" is asserted but never shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The mirrors scene gestures at buried bad habits but summarizes rather than dramatizes internal conflict. Motivation is declared (find fortress of truths) but never tested by a competing desire or forfeiture with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's sympathetic skeptic stance is established but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—skepticism dissolves into empathy without visible cost or foreclosed path. The "courageously kind" trait remains label-only; no on-page choice shows her trading courage or kindness against competing pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("profound empathy," "quiet certainty") rather than embodied perception, and the final transformation from skeptic to believer arrives without dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    The immortal's motivation—"to discover what happens after goodbye"—is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musing ("dimensionally aware, a curse that turned the infinite into a beige repetition") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final dissolution reads as an asserted transformation rather than one earned by prior causal struggle; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from concrete action. Internal conflict is summarized as boredom rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation—balancing her father's karmic debt—is concrete and drives her choices through the rescue. Internal contradiction appears when she handles the dangerous ink pot ("testing it on herself during a moment of despair that had nearly cost her everything") yet her present caution feels muted. The ending choice to give away the ink pot carries visible cost (surrendering her inheritance and tool) but arrives without embodied hesitation or competing impulse in the moment. Elena remains functional pressure but lacks distinct voice or micro-choices that would elevate the relationship as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    Silas's core motivation—preserving temporal textures—is elaborated through detailed ritual, but his interiority defaults to exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The workshop activity is meticulous yet emotionally flat; we are told of "quiet satisfaction" and "complex sense of both loss and preservation" without witnessing contradictory impulses collide in scene. The ending crystallizes his role as guardian, yet the stance feels declared rather than earned through visible internal struggle or cost. No dialogue or relationship pressure tests the obsession on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "discover the texture of memories" is stated but never tested by an on-page choice with cost. His filter ("seeing the world not as it was, but as a mosaic of forgotten moments") remains label-only; we see him listening and layering but no micro-choice reveals what he sacrifices or risks. The final pocket-slip with the label offers no visible foreclosure—he continues unchanged. Interiority leans on abstract declarations ("His motivation was singular") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to prove his theory is clear, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical concepts rather than embodied emotion. The "retelling through cello" device feels more like a plot mechanism than a character-driven choice rooted in contradiction or genuine struggle. The epiphany about consciousness existing within the universe arrives without sufficient on-page resistance or cost—he moves from frustration to "joy of a new beginning" too smoothly. The late mentor's voice and the conference memory add texture but don't create the simultaneous contradictory impulses needed for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her trait ("orderly intuitive") receives mention, but her internal conflict remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The dual allegiance is stated early but never forces a painful on-page choice where she must sacrifice one value for another. Emotions are mostly summarized ("hope waver") rather than embodied through perception and physical response. The foundation stone chip functions as a symbolic anchor but doesn't constrain her decisions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to photograph a final phenomenon is clear and stakes are signaled, but interiority remains thin and generic. The "purposefully curious nature" is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final act—reviewing the developed photograph—lacks embodied emotion or visible cost; the nightwatch grain functions as a lucky charm but does not drive a stake-altering decision. Backstory about old inspectors and corporate interests is sketched but does not tilt present choices with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is presented through consistent sensory detail (blindness, touch-based perception) and his work carries visible micro-choices. However, interiority remains thin—his calm is asserted repeatedly rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final satisfaction reads as generic label ("the calm in his chest deepening into satisfaction") rather than a character-specific emotional texture. No meaningful internal conflict complicates the repair work; competence is untroubled by genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's scholarly confidence and dry wit are labeled but rarely embodied through meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The backstory regarding the mentor and phrasebook occupies significant territory (~25%) but does not reshape present stakes in a dramatized way—it mostly explains why he's here rather than forcing a trade-off. The final decision to "begin the journey inland" reads as a stated intention without visible cost or renunciation; we do not see him forfeit safety, comfort, or an alternate path on the page. Internal contradiction is absent; he experiences wonder and methodical determination but no friction between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    The tuner remains an opaque cipher throughout—his interior is entirely absent, leaving no contradictory impulses, embodied emotions, or micro-choices under pressure. He moves "with infinitely patient grace" and "his face remained unreadable," but these are labels without dramatized cost or visible character-particular thinking. The piece offers no motivation beyond the abstract goal "to restore shared balance," never tested by internal conflict or a foreclosed path. His smile and "wild hush" eyes at the end are gestural decoration, not earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    Marina's motivation to find her mentor is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses on the page. The final "choice" to integrate with the temple arrives without visible internal conflict or cost—she simply accepts transformation in a single sentence. Interiority consists largely of label-only statements ("primal fear," "motivation grows clearer") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The perfume vial recurs frequently but Marina never hesitates over it or trades one desire against another in a way that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (escape before discovery) is clear and consistent, but his interiority leans heavily on exposition about his father's legacy rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to escape feels inevitable rather than costly; no genuine path is foreclosed with visible tension. Emotional states are largely告诉 through metaphor ("breath held tight," "melancholic repose") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ghost bride functions primarily as a symbolic construct rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "mournful elation" and internal conflict over betrayal are told through exposition rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The botanist remains reactive throughout, never making a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost—he gasps, stumbles, reaches, but never acts against competing wants. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her love a knife that had carved them into eternity") and label-only emotions without embodied particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (empty tides → sleepwalking → labyrinth → weaving transformation), but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven. The "hauntingly optimistic" quality and emotional states are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or specific micro-choices under pressure. The final act of weaving feels more symbolic than earned by prior internal conflict; we see what she does but not the cost of choosing this path over others. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("broken precedents," "reverence") flattens voice particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore faith in lineage is clearly established and her journey from guarded cynicism to "warmly curious" is tracked. The climactic placement of the sundial base is earned by prior causality. However, interiority frequently inflates into abstract philosophizing ("cautious enchantment washed over her," "interrupted journeys of her ancestors converging") that dilutes embodied choice. The final emotional turn—"gentle warming within her chest"—reads as told wisdom rather than dramatized cost, and "warmly curious" is asserted more than constrained in action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elliot's interior is presented entirely through abstract philosophical musings ("liminal spaces," "discover meaning in the margins") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The story tells us he is "carefully inventive" and performs rituals, but we never see him wrestle with competing impulses or make a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost. Motivation remains declarative rather than dramatized through action. The final standing and brushing off reads as completion of a static routine, not a transformation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains fundamentally opaque—his "wisdom disguised as foolishness" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible trade-offs. The embroidery action repeats in identical stems ("his fingers threading," "the needle darting," "his hands moved faster") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "smile" and "mask slipping" are gestural clichés that tell rather than show internal conflict. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; he simply completes the chart and leaves, foreclosing no path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    The medium's motivation is stated but never dramatized through on-page choice under pressure—she performs a ritual procedure without meaningful internal conflict or trade-off. Interiority relies on generic mystical phrasing ("fierce tenderness," "weight of its purpose") rather than character-particular thought. The emotional arc is entirely smooth: she arrives, performs, achieves closure, leaves—no contradictory impulses, no cost to her stance. The piece tells us she "needed to understand" but never shows what understanding costs or changes in her.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal state is embodied through the coral fragment's pulse and the ache in his hand, creating concrete physical anchors for emotion. The shift from professional translator to wounded listener is traced through micro-choices—leaning closer, decrypting the notes—but the final transformation ("unknot something in himself") relies on metaphorical assertion rather than a visible forfeiture with dramatic cost. The girl functions more as catalyst than character with her own pressure, and her disappearance feels convenient rather than earned. Interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("lotus-hearted ache," "shared anxiety") that read as imposed rather than thought-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift, but interiority leans heavily on atmospheric description rather than embodied contradiction. The final satisfaction ("pensive mirth... quiet satisfaction") feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—she succeeds without meaningful resistance. Micro-choices are present (sitting, tracing, beginning the ritual) but lack visceral cost or risk that would elevate the ending's renunciation. The protagonist's competence is unbalanced by genuine struggle; no mistake compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "methodically playful" restoration work is established through vivid imagery, and her interior state during the transition is embodied through sensory detail. However, her motivations remain largely told rather than tested by meaningful friction—the "exchange certainty for curiosity" is articulated by the nickel-man rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible cost. The three nested awakenings function more as conceptual announcements than pressure-driven realizations that force her to foreclose a path. Interiority relies on poetic abstraction ("the pause between question and reply") that distances the reader from embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas shows consistent traits (charm, defiance, boldness) but internal contradiction never acts in scene—he simply escalates from clever to reckless without visible cost pulling him back. The final smile reads performative rather than earned by a foreclosed path. Secondary cast (librarian, poet, botanist) apply pressure but remain functional types without distinct voices or embodied reactions. Motivation is declared ("guard the spark") but the story tells us he thrives rather than showing a micro-choice where defiance costs him safety or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet is characterized almost entirely through label-only interiority ("shyly unstoppable," "quiet determination") and abstract descriptors rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Emotion remains performed rather than embodied—"his insomniac eyes wide with wonder" and "his heart still thrumming" feel generic rather than character-particular. The final choice (reaching for the blossom) lacks visible cost or internal conflict; the pain simply "dissolves" without renunciation or struggle. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure; the protagonist witnesses transformation passively rather than earning it through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caretaker's motivation is clear and repeated, but interiority remains abstract—"foxglove regret" is invoked as a label rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. The final choice to hum and repair the chime, then sacrifice memory for the locket, follows from stated duty but lacks visible internal conflict that would force a hierarchy of values with cost. Emotional progression is linear (hesitation → resolve → melancholy) without the simultaneous push-pull that would elevate characterization. The piece tells us the caretaker feels loss and loneliness rather than dramatizing competing desires in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine on-page cost. Her "carefully reckless" trait exists as a label without constraining choices—the magical promises flow without friction or trade-off. The prose relies heavily on therapeutic self-awareness ("I promise to listen without defense") that reads more as list than lived struggle. When "he" appears, no embodied reaction tests her earlier claims; the reunion is asserted, not earned through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    The machinist's "slyly heartfelt nature" is declared but never embodied in contradictory action; his motivation to "harmonize conflicting values" remains abstract throughout. Interior experience consists largely of interpretation rather than lived contradiction under pressure. The final "decision" to recalibrate lacks visible cost—no relationship, resource, or path is foreclosed on the page. Emotional states are named ("trembling," "anticipation") rather than shown through specific behavioral contradiction or embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to preserve his sister's lost lullaby is concrete and embodied through the meteorite chip, grounding his obsessive behavior. His interiority carries specificity—the dust-mote mapping, the bone tweezers, the trembling hands—but the transformation at closure ("the first, tender bloom of trust") arrives as a declared epiphany rather than dramatized choice under contradictory impulses. The sister's death and the hospital scene remain summary backstory without on-page friction that would test his commitment against a live cost. Internal conflict is asserted more than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elea's motivation (understanding thresholds) is stated but never tested through concrete on-page choice with visible cost. The "featherly determined" trait appears as a label recycled three times without constraining action. Interiority consists largely of abstract philosophizing ("necessary distances," "sacred thresholds") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending offers acceptance of a guardian role, but no prior choice or renunciation earned this shift with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") is declared but never dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her discovery sequence reads as unobstructed research rather than a hierarchy of values tested by cost. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany summary ("the rhythm of belonging wasn't about fitting into a place, but recognizing how all things connect") rather than emerging from a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Kaelen appears at 4:52 AM but applies no pressure; the "shared exhale" is atmospheric convergence, not relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aelia's motivations are declared early but her agency remains largely observational through most of the story—she arranges, positions, watches, places seeds—with decision-making clustered at the discovery moment near the end. The interiority leans toward abstract recollectionist jargon ("emotional imprints," "transliterate emotions") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final realization arrives swiftly without visible cost; she "felt neither triumph nor despair" but "that familiar bittersweet sensation," which reads as label-only rather than a forfeiture that closes a path. A meaningful change is asserted ("she had her answer") but the page shows no trade-off or struggle that earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established as analytical and creative with the bishop motif present throughout, but interiority remains thin—his motivations are stated ("to serenade monotony with creativity") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The woman appears as a facilitator but lacks distinct interior friction; their exchange at the clock feels choreographed rather than earned by prior tension. Micro-choices exist (placing the bishop, touching the clock glass) but they don't foreclose paths with visible cost—everything flows too smoothly toward the orchestrated outcome without genuine stakes testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's motivation to inscribe a cosmic verse remains abstract and label-driven; the transformation at the end is asserted through metaphysical description rather than earned through embodied choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly through sacred forms without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The "spontaneously anchored" binding and her method of "observing gaps" are told as mystical facts rather than lived constraints that force difficult micro-choices. Diagnostic label-speak pervades the interiority: "transcendent purpose," "pure consciousness," "fundamental gaps"—therapy-speak masquerading as characterization (−0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The glazier's interiority remains abstract throughout—"to illuminate value in the mundane" is stated but never tested by a concrete choice with cost. His "reading between lines" manifests only as passive observation of ripples that conveniently deliver seven discrete insights without internal contradiction or struggle. The daughter's laughter and the storm are told memories/predictions rather than embodied tensions that force a present decision. No micro-choice under pressure alters his stance; he arrives satisfied and departs satisfied, foreclosing no path.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is motivated by trauma and guilt, but interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("gently skilled," "hard softness," "translate his pain into a language others could understand"). The bargain with himself reads as imposed convenience rather than authentic crisis logic. Emotional progression is largely summarized across three years rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final shift to "healing" arrives without visible cost or forfeited path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara remains a collection of abstract labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") without embodied interiority or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her work with the decorations is described externally rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; we never see her hesitate, doubt, or make a trade-off that reveals hierarchy of values. The "serene upheaval" moment is asserted rather than felt through her body or perception. The ending smile and balloon-light heart read as stock satisfaction rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian's motivation ("to discover what walls dream about") is declared but never genuinely tested by competing desires or concrete cost. His interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("felt its silent reverberations in his bones," "sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin") rather than embodied contradiction. The woman's story is absorbed passively; no on-page choice forces him to renounce a live option or pay a visible price. The ending declares him "chosen" without dramatizing what he forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and grounded in the borrowed heartbeat conceit, which provides a concrete physical anchor. However, the painter remains largely observational; her choices are ritualistic rather than conflicted, and the borrowed heart functions more as thematic ornament than a force that constrains or complicates her decisions under pressure. The emotional arc is asserted ("she would return tomorrow") without dramatized cost or a credible path foreclosed. No meaningful internal contradiction or micro-choice alters her stance by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—he seeks redemption—but his interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ritual of reading names shows a micro-choice, but the operatively gentle trait remains largely label-only without a dramatized cost that forces him to trade one value against another. Internal conflict is narrated as resolved tension ("something shift within him") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat. Emotion is asserted ("quiet resolve," "quiet understanding") more than shown through specific physical sensation or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.2)
    Silas displays contradictory impulses—amoral profiteer vs. sentimental preservationist—but the contradiction is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. His kneeling and device activation feel choreographed rather than earned by internal conflict visible on the page. The "secretly sentimental heart breaking for the thousandth time" is label-only interiority that skips embodied emotion. Backstory dominates (~40% of the text) and while anchored to the salt flat, it doesn't tilt present stance through meaningful micro-choices that alter his approach to the release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout—a "chaste courtesan" label without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("whisper in a world of silence," "paradox draped in silk") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The untangling action at closure feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; we see no established habit, fear, or want tested. Emotional states are asserted ("gasped but did not falter," "trembling") without the messy simultaneity of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined almost entirely by labels—"urbane," "uncommonly serene," "practiced grace"—with no embodied contradiction or internal friction visible in scene. The argument that opens the story is off-page, leaving no dramatized stake or micro-choice to anchor his motivation. His puppet performances are summarized across weeks rather than shown in one high-pressure beat where a decision costs him something. The final "cut strings" moment gestures at release but arrives without prior resistance or visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is characterized primarily through external actions and abstract labels ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted") rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. His motivation to honor overlooked histories drives the construction, but no competing impulse or internal friction tests that commitment—he works with "reverence," "unhurried," without hesitation or cost. The fallen monarch is incorporated smoothly into the structure without visible emotional struggle or choice that forecloses another path. The final walk away feels like a prepared exit rather than a choice earned by on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    The caster's motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. His "technically gentle" hands appear as label-only repetition without constraining choices. The final transformation—guilt dissolving "like frost in spring"—reads as summary rather than embodied struggle, and the interior voice relies on stock metaphors ("winter fire," "river of memory") that flatten character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's unique temporal perception is grounded in concrete micro-choices (nudging the floor panel, stepping aside from sparks) that show his foresight constraining present action. His philosophical motivation—"to discover why some paths choose their walkers"—is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants, and the final acceptance ("he was created by necessity") reads as epiphany without prior resistance or visible cost. Interiority is vivid and character-particular ("a ghost in the machine of his own life"), though the climactic decision to "offer his own mind" lacks embodied hesitation or trade-off that would make the stakes visceral. The renunciation of escape is asserted in the final line but not earned through an on-page struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias remains consistently motivated by precision and his devotion to the cosmos, with his frugal nature informing his careful preparation. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical summaries rather than embodied contradiction—the "empirically ironic" tension is asserted but never dramatized through competing impulses in action. The climactic moment (pressing palm to tile, world tilting) unfolds without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; he simply completes his task and walks away calm. Emotional states are labeled ("shiver...of alignment," "calm of a man") rather than shown through contradictory physical response or difficult micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a static vessel whose "pacifist scheming" is asserted but never dramatized through internal conflict or choice. His interiority consists of generic observations ("witnessed," "understood") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The parade of visiting souls (Leo, Maya, three unnamed others) are interchangeable symptom-bearers rather than individuals; their transformations happen in identical three-note sequences without resistance that would reveal character. The final claim that "Elias had somehow healed parts of himself he didn't know were broken" is unearned—no prior wound was dramatized, no cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his physical grounding is established through tactile detail (calloased hands, breath plumes). Interior life remains largely opaque; his decisions feel procedural rather than conflicted. The astronomer exists only in backstory without pressure, and the dream-bird's "invitation" arrival lacks genuine struggle or cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mender's interior life shows concrete embodiment (quartz eye whirring, fingers stained with dirt) and her persistence is anchored in specific loss. However, the daughter remains entirely off-page and abstract, reduced to "stubborn grin" and a departed ribbon—no contradictory impulses act in scene, only reflective longing. The final choice to plant symbols feels more ritual than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("hope," "resilience—false, but functional") without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    Margaret's interiority is labeled rather than embodied—"bewildered," "disquiet," "compelled"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to document visits and later prepare a note for her successor occurs off-camera, removing agency from view. The final acceptance ("strange joy") reads as unearned epiphany, a tidy emotional resolution that skips the cost of renunciation. No micro-choices under pressure constrain or reveal her hierarchy of values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific (rescue Kael through linguistic scholarship), and her method of study over physical searching reveals character. However, the breakthrough feels cerebral rather than emotionally contradictory—her discovery proceeds too smoothly without internal friction or blind spots that compound under pressure. Kael's transfixion reads as told rather than dramatized through his own contradictory impulses; we see him frozen in beauty but not wrestling with it. The final choice (speaking his true name) lacks visible cost or trade-off that would elevate this from competent to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant nature") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final merging of the chimera's halves is asserted as transformation without earned causality from prior struggle; the protagonist moves through set-pieces without visible costs that foreclose paths. Embodied emotion is absent—no physicalized fear, exhaustion, or doubt that would ground the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("translate confusion into clarity") is clear and consistent, driving him through the door and toward the rope puzzle. His "warmly methodical" nature is shown through his cataloging instinct and pattern recognition. However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("his own bones were gears shifting") and the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle—he "suddenly knew he'd always understood" without visible cost or contradiction. The protagonist remains competent throughout without genuine blind spots that compound pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lorne's motivation is clear and his goal-driven actions are consistent throughout, but his interior experience leans heavily on label-speak ("hammered repose," "bloom of hush") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist's emotional state is described more than dramatized—his "muscles untensing" and "rare expression" tell us relief rather than showing competing impulses in the moment. No meaningful secondary character pressure appears, and the mapkeeper's competence faces no genuine mistakes or blind spots that complicate his success. The final standing and smiling reads as summary of emotional state rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and sustained—proving coincidences have meaning—but his internal experience remains abstract. The retrocognitive trait operates as a plot convenience that grants knowledge without visible cost or constraint on his choices. His success at the end arrives without meaningful internal contradiction or a path foreclosed; the weight settling "like a cloak woven from starlight and silence" is metaphorical comfort, not embodied struggle. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of conflicting values.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation ("to sculpt identity from experience") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His actions—tracing ledgers, measuring shadows, writing notes—show dedication but no meaningful internal conflict or cost that would foreclose a path. The phrase "preemptively nostalgic" appears four times as a label without embodied consequence. The final smile and settled mantle read as emotional summary rather than earned transformation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlo's interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("gravity of hopelessness," "serious playfulness") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization—that hopelessness is merely absence of created light—reads as a delivered epiphany rather than one earned through on-page struggle or micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get "slight frown" and "laughed softly" but little visceral contradiction. The change at closure (renewed purpose) lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed; Marlo simply walks away restored.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's observational stance is rendered through concrete micro-choices (tracing the rim, turning the cicada, meeting Mara's eyes), and their tangential approach creates internal texture. The character exhibits embodied specificity in handling objects and filtering perception. However, the final shift feels somewhat told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—Elian's acceptance arrives via articulation of their philosophy rather than a dramatized interior collision. The warmly observant trait operates consistently but remains more label than constraint that forecloses options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—collecting flavors of silence—is established but remains abstract throughout. Her interiority leans heavily on stock poetic phrasing ("agonizing and divine," "symphony of silences") rather than embodied contradiction. The doll's "intangibly tangible presence" is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. No meaningful cost or renunciation is visible; she succeeds without friction, and the final whisper feels like confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to teach silence how to comfort") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Her actions follow a purely procedural sequence—adjust reins, pull vial, kneel, place vial, watch—without internal friction or visible cost. The resolution is asserted ("Elara knew the terrace had understood") rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("the space between sounds") and summary statements rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a functional but thinly sketched protagonist. His "wisely adventurous" trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The journey's pivotal choices—slipping past guards, plunging through the waterfall—read as plot conveniences rather than decisions revealing hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("heart raced") and the final ascent lacks embodied struggle or genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("teach suffocating things how to breathe") is stated rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. Her past bridge-burning is told in summary without showing the contradictory impulses that would make the final reconnection feel earned. The "miscalculated" realization arrives via exposition rather than through failed tactics on the page. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("phantom pains," "necrotic tissue") instead of character-specific embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo's motivation (turning metaphorical pressure into literal diamonds) is articulated but never internally conflicted or tested through competing impulses. The "pyramid scheme survivor" backstory remains abstract—no specific memory, micro-choice, or embodied shame shapes his actions in the mushroom farm. Mara appears only to hand over the bolt and clap; no relationship pressure or secondary challenge emerges. The transformation feels given rather than earned, with Leo pouring regret into the bolt in a single gesture that produces immediate success without struggle or visible cost to his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to uncover hidden truth is stated early but remains abstract; the interiority leans heavily on ornamental phrasing ("wrapped around him like a shroud") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "dynasty ender" label does surface work without embodied cost—his final stance (truth-bringer) is declared rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses a path. The great-grandfather figure applies external pressure, but Elias's internal conflict never dramatizes competing wants or a hierarchy of values with on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The knight remains a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Interiority consists largely of stock phrasing ("the weight of his allegiance settle," "shivering bliss") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "smile" and transformation into "keeper of what could be" arrive as declaration rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a concrete path. Motivation is told repeatedly but never tested by a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior is textured with embodied detail (dust patterns, the button's weight, the file's "click"), and his motive to magnify small kindnesses drives his archival choices under pressure. Internal contradiction surfaces briefly when his "broken heart" is marked but not extinguished, yet the piece leans toward reflective observation rather than live conflict between impulses. The final moment—standing and reweighting the shelves—reads as insight more than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, capping the score in the upper 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is established early and her resourcefulness shown through concrete details (collecting obsolete technology, coded puddle messages). However, the character work suffers from overwriting that replaces embodied action with abstract declarations: "carefully resourceful beyond measure," "underestimated rebel," "keeper of secrets" are labels rather than demonstrated contradictions under pressure. The climactic choice to broadcast Marcus's speech lacks visible internal conflict or cost—Maya executes a pre-planned contingency without on-page struggle, foreclosing no meaningful option. Jenna's capture/defection is mentioned but never shapes Maya's present tactics or creates friction in her execution.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and persistent—he plays to disrupt the prophecy—but his internal contradiction remains thin; we see him executing a practiced ritual rather than wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. The embodied detail is present (dewdrops on forehead, fingers hovering over keys) but emotional complexity flattens into dutiful repetition. The final reflection about creating "music designed to be forgotten" offers interiority, yet the cost of this burden is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose options. The piece leans on reflective summary in the opening and closing thirds, which anchors present action but does not sufficiently alter present stakes through on-page decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains thinly sketched: his "orderly seed sorter" occupation and monument-building hobby are told rather than shown under pressure. The transformation at the end—"He would become a keeper"—is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses or a difficult choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("heart seized," "trembling hands") and the protagonist undergoes zero internal conflict; he simply receives a gift and accepts a new purpose. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; the piece withholds agency from the character entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tinkerer's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("uncertainly certain," "befriend uncertainty") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The protagonist's key choice—to follow the compass after placing broken parts in the pool—arrives without prior dramatized struggle between competing impulses; the laugh and the decision feel declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Emotional progression flattens into a single epiphanic mood rather than contradictory states layering across beats. The final renunciation lacks visible cost; we're told he's ready but don't see what path he forecloses or what he sacrifices by leaving the parts behind.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is consistently specific ("foundry's air now tasting of closure, heavy and light at once"), and the kintsugi repair serves as an embodied choice that forecloses his prior approach to balance. However, the motivational arc leans heavily on abstract internal narration—"testing its density in the void," "holding opposites until they made something new"—rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of "balance as symmetry" is earned by the coin repair, but the character reads more as a philosophical vehicle than a flawed individual making costly mistakes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.2)
    The collector remains a cipher throughout—"modestly fearless" and "luminous ache" are labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist performs a fixed ritual (raise tooth, play tune, weave confession) without visible cost or internal friction. The woman and child are summoned and healed in identical beats with no variation in the collector's approach, flattening any sense of struggle. Interiority consists of atmospheric declarations ("his chest tightened," "bittersweet joy") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's proprioceptive enhancement shapes his experience concretely—feeling ground tilt, air currents, joint alignment—and his motivation (mathematics of mercy) drives the closure equation. However, the final "discovery" M = ∫(k/R) arrives as epiphany rather than earned choice; the protagonist endures and realizes but does not decide or renounce with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interior voice leans toward therapeutic abstraction ("trauma responses," "displaced rootedness") in places where embodied sensation could carry the work, weakening specificity under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    The translator's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interior life consists largely of reflective summary ("her work had always been about honoring overlooked histories") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist observes and receives rather than making decisions that alter tactics; the merchant guides, the fragment pulses, the painting shifts—agency remains external. The final "smile" and pen-lift gesture toward change but lack the visible cost or foreclosed path required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The technician's motivations are clear and his observational skill is consistently rendered, but his emotional arc is too smooth—he watches, retrieves, and leaves without meaningful internal conflict. The trapeze artist's ghost is vivid but remains entirely externalized; no contradictory impulses complicate his choices. The final "weightless burden" settling back onto his shoulders reads as a label rather than an embodied shift, and no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to escape eternity's cage is clear and his decision to pull the lever feels earned by the prior whispers and frost messages. However, his interior life leans heavily on abstract concepts ("perfect systems," "defiance against chaos") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation—ink-clean hands, fear lifted—reads more as declared epiphany than a choice that forecloses a lived path with visible cost scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's poetic lens and revolutionary past shape his perception throughout, with embodied moments like tracing light eddies and veiling mirrors. His motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" drives the central choice to smuggle the shard, though the final decision feels somewhat predetermined rather than torn from contradictory impulses. The internal contradiction between academic method and emotional truth operates mostly in reflection rather than forcing simultaneous pulls in scene. Minor deduction for the vision sequence reading as convenient revelation rather than hard-won insight with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through visible contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; his skills and tools align perfectly with needs without struggle. The climactic repair unfolds as smooth execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Embodied emotion is replaced by atmospheric gesture ("fingers… moved with a dancer's grace").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through specific obsession (petrichor collecting) and distinct perceptual signature (the "auditory clearing" after the mill closes). His motivation—"to find the place where explanations fail"—is embodied through concrete action (psychometry, descent) and culminates in a renunciation with felt cost (leaving the compass, accepting mystery). Internal contradiction operates in scene: he pursues mystery yet practices a method meant to extract answers, and the resolution acknowledges this via "a finder no longer." Minor slips: the explorers' dissolution is told rather than shown, and the final epiphany edges toward diagnostic self-awareness ("hinged awakening...door labeled 'there is a reason for everything'") that feels slightly over-articulated for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("perpetually learning hands," "turbine-hum reverie") rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. The character's motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a conflicting impulse or visible cost on the page. The final "smile" and declarative closure lack the embodied ambiguity or renunciation that would earn the change. Internal experience reads as a performed thesis rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's obsession with night-blooming flowers is established through repeated observation and artifact collection, but her interior landscape remains largely label-driven ("quietly driven," "fixation grew") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final arc—from obsession to contentment—is told via summary across seasons rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing desires under pressure. Her motivation is coherent but her choices feel more like stations on a predetermined track than genuine struggles that foreclose paths with visible cost. The ending shift to "contentment" arrives as summary rather than earned crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to uncover silenced histories is established, and his final action arranging "REMEMBER" shows embodied commitment. However, the retrocognitive trap functions more as atmospheric label than embodied constraint driving micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; his arc from cataloger to translator feels more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The diary's warmth and ink bleeding onto skin gesture toward embodiment but remain decorative rather than forcing a visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elian's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His "choices"—balance, art and sustenance, democracy and wisdom—read as abstract shopping lists without visceral cost or competing pulls. The interior voice relies heavily on summary ("He knew the cost of indecision") and lacks embodied emotion during the creation act. The final transformation happens off-stage; we're told the town thrives but never witness a micro-choice that forecloses a path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is detailed and grounded in his craft, with embodied moments ("fingers remembering languages"). However, the transformation feels declared rather than earned—he shifts from archivist to "vessel for rebirth" through absorption rather than genuine internal conflict. The choice to press wax to temple lacks contradictory impulses; it reads as inevitable acceptance rather than a difficult decision with visible cost. His embodied struggle never surfaces as competing desires acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses—"furiously tranquil" is asserted repeatedly as a label rather than shown through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's internal experience remains abstract and uniform throughout; the peak act (pressing the acorn cap, stepping through) proceeds without visible friction or cost that would reveal character limits. Agency reads as execution of a predetermined ritual rather than choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("heat of purpose," "wild serenity") and the reflection on the vortex inheritance operates as exposition rather than tilt to present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's profession and philosophy are established, but interiority remains thin and label-driven ("credibly curious," "favoring listening over noise" stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses). The peak choice—switching systems—lacks visible internal conflict or cost; he simply executes procedure. Backstory about evolution of methods and sensor calibration fills space without forcing present micro-choices that alter tactics. Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses under pressure are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("spiritually curious," "flourishing stillness") rather than embodied contradiction. The seven-decade jump and her transformation are summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Key moments like "experienced a moment of profound clarity that transcended ordinary consciousness" use therapy-speak at peak beats without concrete embodiment. The final choice to "establish a new rhythm" lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elisha's motivation is clear—preserving the covenant—but his choices arrive through intuited understanding rather than visible internal conflict. The "tranquilly perceptive" trait functions as a label that permits smooth comprehension without struggle; we see no contradictory impulses or credible mistakes under pressure. The ritual at the central hive and his acknowledgment of new ghosts are gestures of mediation, but the cost of his solitude and the weight of his role remain asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("understanding flooded his senses") instead of embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation—"a quiet, persistent need to understand the texture of time passing"—remains abstract label rather than embodied contradiction. The borrowed-time setup never constrains a choice with visible cost; he moves through discovery beats without friction between want and survival pressure. Internal states are asserted ("his heart heavy but hopeful") rather than shown through micro-choices under stress. The final acceptance lacks the foreclosed path or renunciation required for earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The poet's interior is built on reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "warmly attentive" touch and "mission" are told rather than shown through micro-choices with visible cost. The weaving action near midpoint offers a gesture toward agency, but the ending withdraws into passive observation ("simply sat, observing") and summary interiority ("the poet had always believed"), flattening the final stakes. No meaningful renunciation or stance crystallization with felt cost occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen's dying-man-on-a-mission arc is clear, but interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("symbiotic relationship," "interspecies respect") rather than embodied contradiction. The diagnosis functions as setup, but we never see him wrestle with fear, regret, or a specific forsaken path—only "brazen calm" and "peculiar peace," which flatten emotional complexity. His systematic wire-wrapping reads more as allegorical labor than goal-driven choice with visible tradeoffs. The final moment offers acceptance without prior struggle on the page, so the renunciation feels declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's skeptic-to-believer arc is signaled but undermines itself through abstraction. The interior voice relies on thematic labels ("chemistry of homecoming," "luminous skeptic") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The kneeling gesture and amber placement occur, but the choice feels unmotivated by prior micro-decisions—he simply arrives at understanding through atmospheric saturation rather than a dramatized collision of wants. The final claimed transformation lacks visible cost; doubt "cracks" via assertion, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The coachman remains a static, archetypal figure throughout—no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure, only ritualized action. Interiority is absent; the character executes a predetermined symbolic role without internal friction or embodied emotion. The final vigil lacks dramatized cost or credible endurance; we see only a ceremonial tableau. Motivation exists as told purpose ("to let a garden reclaim a battlefield") rather than lived conflict that forecloses options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to find his sister is clear and personal, grounding his actions throughout. However, his specialized skills feel more like conveniences than constraints—he never struggles with misinterpretation or false leads, and his intuitive readings are always correct. The sister remains an abstraction; no contradictory impulse (doubt, fear of what he'll find, temptation to stop searching) acts in scene. The final choice to go to the bridge tomorrow lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his contradictory impulses—isolation versus exploration, grief versus purpose—operate simultaneously on the page. The sketch custom provides embodied ritual that anchors emotion without therapy-speak. His "blessed pariah" status and its attendant pain drive micro-choices (tracing the compass, pausing to catch the shimmer, deciding to chart the ghostly stars) that feel earned. The final smile and readiness to navigate land as credible endurance rather than epiphany, though the transformation from survivor to explorer could have been more viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to "embrace the unknown" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The Architect's shift from suspicious guardian to willing participant happens too quickly without earned interiority. The chess-piece exchange ritual provides some character texture, but Kaelen's choices feel predetermined rather than pressured by genuine internal conflict. The final renunciation ("keep it") lands cleanly but lacks the embodied cost and micro-hesitations that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's dual identity as crisis actor/survivor is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her mission to document small gestures remains abstract—we see her walk and trace dust, but these actions feel performed rather than emerging from embodied internal conflict. The "benevolently ruthless" label and "nomadic penumbra" are announced but never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on therapeutic distance ("crisis survivor self," "actor in her") that flattens immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is dominated by abstract wish-fulfillment ("visions she could control," "seeding new realities") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her talent awakening happens through passive discovery (touching stone and feather simultaneously) without genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The "painful memories" that supposedly drive her remain unspecified throughout, reducing motivation to label-only abstraction. The final decision to "not need to return to this world at all" arrives without visible cost or dramatized trade-off—no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tutor's guilt is consistently embodied through his nervous habits and chess-framed perception. Internal conflict emerges in his trembling fingers and "fierce repose," showing contradictory impulses. The final board recognition earns the shift from guilt to lesson-learned, though the emotional progression feels slightly telescoped. The stalemate insight arrives with adequate causality but borders on epiphanic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elaran's motivation is clear and consistent—defiant artist driven by curiosity—but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The "innocently mischievous" trait is asserted repeatedly without generating on-page contradictory impulses or friction. Internal conflict is told ("The defiant artist in him wanted to continue, to finish what he started…The human in him hesitated") rather than enacted through simultaneous impulses in scene. The ending choice feels predetermined rather than earned through visible struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's motivation to restore the statue is clear, but his interiority relies heavily on abstracted concepts ("quilting memories," "kintsugi intentions") rather than embodied contradiction. The piece tells us he is "uncertain" yet his actions proceed with unwavering confidence—no moment where doubt actually alters a tactic. Emotional states are labeled ("gasped air back into his lungs") but the physical crisis of near-drowning doesn't degrade perception or force a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final realization ("not about saving the statue...but about showing oblivion itself") reads as an unearned epiphany delivered via summary rather than discovered through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter's interiority is developed through concrete sensory detail (trembling hands, stiffening bristles) and the shell as a charged object, but the core motivation to "find something that couldn't be broken" arrives late and feels abstract. The lowering of the shell into the tide pool reads as a deliberate renunciation with cost, but the epiphany that follows—"the shell had never been about preserving the past; it had been about letting it go"—skirts therapy-speak and articulates the arc too cleanly. Internal contradiction is present (keeping vs. releasing) but resolved through narrated insight rather than embodied struggle. The character remains observational through most beats; agency clusters at the cave sequence without prior micro-choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior commitment to his theory is established early and drives the ascent, but his motivation remains largely abstract—"whispers imbued with pure intent"—without embodied contradiction or genuine cost until the final release. The "screaming tenderness" offers texture, yet the emotional progression feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The cork becomes a fetish object rather than a tool that forces tradeoffs, and the final act of release reads more as ritual than as a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible regret or gain.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The navigator's grief and ritual are embodied through tactile detail (tracing coat seams, the warming censer foot), but interiority often veers into abstract declaration ("grief had its own logic") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The choice to stop answering the phone and walk "through" grief arrives without visible on-page cost that forecloses a prior path—it reads as acceptance rather than renunciation with pressure. Micro-choices (sketching the map, placing the censer foot) exist but lack the friction of competing wants that would drive higher-stakes embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (safety from empathy exposure) is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her decision to use the glass eye. Her involuntary truthfulness creates embodied conflict when the stranger approaches, broadcasting fear that both characters feel. The final choice—using the relic and then considering sharing its benefits—carries visible cost (three seasons of truffles, isolation ended). However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("fractured grace," "psychological safety") rather than character-particular perceptions, and the stranger remains functional rather than dynamically pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Hemlock's borrowed-memory power is asserted but never dramatizes internal contradiction or embodied struggle under pressure. The woman's story arrives via exposition rather than through micro-choices that reveal Hemlock's values. His final nightly gesture reads as sentiment without visible cost or foreclosed path. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart broke," "eternal language") and therapy-adjacent labels that flatten rather than embody emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's loneliness and role as "keeper of stories" is established, but his interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than dramatized in action. The final choice to "start drawing his own" feels thematically clear but arrives without visible cost or renunciation on the page—he simply returns to his shop and picks up a pen. The empirically intuitive trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates a visible tradeoff. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "his heart pounding" and "joints creaking," but peak beats lean on generic intensifiers rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The queen's motivation to climb is established through recurring dreams, but her interior life remains abstract—"weight of a crown," "disenchanted"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The seneschal's revelation that he "had known her secret all along" arrives unearned; no prior action dramatized his awareness or created tension from that knowledge gap. The final choice—awakening to celestial identity—feels like inherited memory rather than a decision forged under pressure, and the "price" paid by the kingdom is declared but not felt on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("lacy menace") in the final line further distances the reader from embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is dense with label-only abstractions ("scientifically romantic mind," "alchemical focus") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist performs elaborate light-weaving but her emotional state during the act remains summarized ("resolve hardening") without specific tension between competing impulses. Kael's whispered secret is never dramatized—we never learn what it is or see Elara wrestle with its implications in concrete terms. The final choice to "return differently" is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior state—temporal confusion and jealousy of past selves—is established early and embodied through the gravestone discovery. However, his journey remains largely contemplative; the peak moment ("For one perfect moment...he began to soar") arrives as epiphany rather than earned choice under contradictory pressure. The jealousy method andchronological confusion function more as atmospheric labels than contradictory impulses that force a visible tradeoff. Interiority occasionally slides into diagnostic phrasing ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") that reads thematic rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's grief and sensory loss anchor her motivation clearly, and the screw reading offers embodied choice under pressure. However, the recovery moment—scent returning at "cedar" and "freesia"—arrives without sufficient cost or resistance; the trembling simply stops. The grandmother's story provides emotional weight, but Elara's interior voice occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("pain into purpose," "miracles were ordinary") that flattens contradiction. Embodied emotion is strong in the loupe scene but the ending resolves too cleanly without visible foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aeris's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—clutching the quill, writing the child's prayer—and the crystallization provides a vivid physical manifestation of internal stress. The transformation from analogue to mineral self is shown through specific sensory detail (knuckles refracting light, tear becoming gem) rather than abstract summary. Minor weakness: the grandmother's superstition arrives late as backstory without earlier grounding, and the shift from rune scholar logic to childhood belief could use one more micro-hesitation to deepen the contradiction. The final acceptance and the scar as "story" land with quiet conviction, earning the renunciation of perfect healing.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eloise's motivation (overdue apology) is clear and drives the action, but her interiority leans heavily on scaffolding ("her voice a mix of gravel and starlight") rather than embodied contradiction. Alistair's ghost voice arrives only at the end, limiting his presence to exposition. The relationship reads as told backstory ("You were just a girl") without dramatized tension in the present moment. The final choice to deliver the apology lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing impulse struggles on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    The "end of history witness" remains an abstract title rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority consists of philosophical generalities ("scaffolding of reality itself," "recursive falsehoods") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final "act" of unifying with the dictionary page is metaphorical gesture, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. No internal conflict dramatized; the character observes and philosophizes without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to understand clock measurement is clear and sustained, though his interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied contradiction. The "squinting" gesture recurs but functions more as a tic than a revelation of internal conflict. His final epiphany feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle—he moves from wondering to understanding without visible cost or foreclosed options. The thirty-seven years of service provide context but no present micro-choices test his commitment until the very end, where the smile reads as resolution without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The father's interiority is minimal—he's nearly absent until the end—and Elara's compulsive-gambler trait is told ("a compulsive gambler's paradox") but never shown through a concrete wager, risk, or behavioral tell. Her motivation ("widen his perspectives responsibly") drives collection activity but lacks internal contradiction or embodied stakes: we never see her wrestle with the gamble of leaving him vulnerable or question whether this rebellion serves him or herself. The final "thank you" from the father arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, more warm exchange than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Archie's motivation is established—teaching endings how to begin—but remains abstract and unexplored through embodied contradiction. The piece withholds on-page choices under pressure; Archie exists as a passive conduit delivering scripted phrases rather than a character navigating genuine tension. Internal conflict is asserted ("dread" at realizing phrase repetition) but never dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses. The ending gestures toward agency ("whenever he chose to make his final call") yet forecloses none of the established options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has a clear motivation (preserve moments to honor Melina and maintain the covenant), and the locket placement at the end demonstrates commitment with cost. However, interior texture relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria," "the weight of small moments") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision-making proceeds smoothly without genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act feels more like completing a ritual than a choice forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orion's loneliness is established early and embodied through gesture ("smiled tightly at a curling tendril of ivy"), but his transition from jocular desperation to authentic laughter feels somewhat abrupt. The "vacuum in his chest" risks label-only emotion, though later beats ground it in attention shifts. Internal contradiction is present (mask-wearing vs. genuine hope) but the climactic choice to "stay still and listen" lacks sufficient on-page struggle; the shift reads more conceptual than earned through micro-decisions under pressure. The woman's role is functional but her opacity doesn't force Orion to adapt tactics visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael's interior life is established through embodied perception (tremor language, ring warmth, note-as-shiver), and the opening grounds him in consistent sensory filtering. However, the motivation—"to quiet the storm in his own soul"—remains abstract and label-only; no prior micro-choice or contradiction dramatizes what grief or longing cost him in tactical terms. The final smile and "genuine smile in years" land as summary epiphany rather than earned renunciation with visible price. Agency is present but the internal arc resolves via assertion, not on-page foreclosure of a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The interpreter's interior life is consistent—"confidently uncertain" manifests in both their revision choices and final acceptance of imperfection. The character makes on-page decisions (unbending the nib, writing/rewriting the timeline) that alter options with visible cost ("the weight of the loss"). However, the emotional progression relies heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("garden of doubt," "threshing meaning") rather than embodied contradiction; the actual struggle between fixing mistakes and accepting mess reads more as summary than dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Julian and Lyra's motivations are stated ("we'll make them remember," "translate silence into music") but remain abstract; no concrete personal stakes emerge beyond a vague mission. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("heart swelled with bittersweet joy, sorrow of loss entwined with hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The filmless camera functions as talisman and symbolic device but never forces a micro-choice with visible cost. Lyra's "quietly charismatic" trait is label-only; her signing is described lyrically but doesn't create friction or enable a tactical choice that alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's arc from arsonist to restorer is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final match-burning reads as symbolic reversal without visible cost—she walks away at peace, undermining any genuine renunciation or trade-off. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive mind") and the mother's promise remains abstract motivation never tested by on-page friction. Emotional progression is linear summary rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("entangled memories," "auroral sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction. His "rebellion" is declared but never costs him a visible choice on the page—he drums, the garden responds, the dream succeeds without meaningful resistance or trade-off. The final "burden lifted" reads as convenience rather than earned change rooted in prior causality. Therapy-speak and diagnostic framing ("resilience," "conduit") appear at peak beats without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to prove the whisper theory reads clear, but his confidence throughout flattens internal conflict—he never doubts, missteps, or pays a visible emotional cost. The decision to hand Jenna the coin after winning undercuts stakes rather than earning them; no prior causality shows why he'd forfeit his prize. Jenna's arc from scoffing rival to awed follower happens in a single beat without resistance. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "mask of irritation," "awe," "legends."

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guardian's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Anna's grief is embodied through tears and carrying unsent letters, but her interior remains thin—we never see her struggle with conflicting wants. The guardian's "spiralingly calm quality" and "silent empathy" are labels that never constrain a choice or generate visible cost. Backstory about Anna's father exceeds functional need without altering present stakes until the pattern reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arthur's interiority relies heavily on his telepathic gift to carry motivation, but his micro-choices under pressure remain largely observational rather than agonistic. The final moment—"cradling the fragile hope"—repeats the metaphor without embodying a contradictory impulse or visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is asserted ("fears about being discovered, doubts about effectiveness") but not dramatized through simultaneous competing drives in a single beat. The piece leans on telling his emotional states rather than showing them through embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's interiority is present but often abstract ("Violence she'd never known gave way to tender ferocity"). The scrimshaw triggers movement but the internal contradiction—guarded cage versus longing—never manifests as simultaneous impulses in a single choice. The island visit feels more like symbolic pilgrimage than a decision with visible psychological cost; she hesitates briefly then moves forward without foreclosing a legible alternative path. Embodiment is thin: "clutching," "pressed to chest," but emotional states are frequently labeled rather than enacted through contradictory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and the performance-of-compliance through blank-faced stillness reads as purposeful. However, interiority leans heavily on theatrical self-narration ("The knife slices through the birch") that feels more like voice flourish than embodied thought under pressure. The whittling ritual and flower preservation show consistent behavioral choices, but the internal contradictions never truly collide in scene—Elara performs both roles sequentially rather than wrestling with them simultaneously. The final break in blankness ("we remember how to be human again") arrives as declaration rather than earned through a visible on-page cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is stated—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—but never tested or complicated by genuine internal friction. His identity as a "cloud-shadow poet" remains label-only; no specific trade-off or hierarchy of values shapes his choices under pressure. The dissolution sequence is a smooth progression without contradictory impulses; he simply succeeds, transforming into "a living embodiment of his art" in a way that feels ordained rather than earned. The final realization that "the atrium was full of them [boundaries]" adds no visible cost or foreclosed path, only expanded possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's motivation—seeking color through a bartered awakening—drives his actions across the piece, and his "innocently cunning" trait shapes his method of approaching Lyra via plant arrangements. The final moment of sensory awakening is embodied through concrete perception (amber, sienna, cobalt), but the interior contradiction remains thin: his shrewdness is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. The barter negotiation is nearly silent, reducing relational friction that could have deepened his cunning or tested his commitment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    The bell ringer's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("texture of connection," "weight of absence") rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation remains declarative—told through quasi-philosophical musings—without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The smile described as "powerfully gentle" is a label, not an embodied reaction, and the final stance ("resonance we choose to share") feels like an announced epiphany rather than one earned through dramatized struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; the journey inward is asserted, not forced by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear—grief transformed into purpose—but interiority relies heavily on summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The journey from mourning jewelry maker to observatory keeper is told more than dramatized; we're given the arc ("two years after hitting rock bottom") without witnessing micro-choices under pressure that reveal internal conflict. Students appear as abstractions ("Three mothers, a widower, and a brother") without distinct agency or resistance. The final paragraphs summarize legacy and network rather than showing a decisive choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to map cultural patterns is established early and drives her confiding choice with Professor Chen. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract contemplation ("spaces between concepts," "cultural turning points") rather than embodied contradictions or genuine struggle. The decision to confide feels more like thesis presentation than a high-stakes choice with visible cost; Chen's arrival provides convenient validation rather than forcing Elara to navigate opposition or doubt. Micro-choices under pressure are largely absent—she demonstrates competence in explaining her system but no mistakes, blind spots, or friction that would render her fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The historian remains a cipher throughout, defined by pursuit rather than contradiction. Interiority consists almost entirely of abstract declarations ("anguished joy," "forbidden knowledge") rather than embodied conflict. The purification ritual lacks visible micro-choices with competing costs; she simply performs movements "deliberately designed to avoid predictability" without dramatizing what she risks or renounces. Motivational vocabulary recycles prompt labels instead of discovering character-specific stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's role reads more as observer than agent—her "softly deliberate movements" and retrospective analysis dominate, but on-page choices that alter tactics under pressure are sparse. The river stone's mechanics and the metamorphosis are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrases ("luminous regret," "methodical resolve") without specific sensory anchors or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation happens largely off-page, summarized in a single paragraph without visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maria's interiority is established through concrete actions (tracing the tail, examining logs), and her method of processing betrayal through animal-handling metaphors feels character-specific. However, the emotional progression relies heavily on metaphorical equivalence ("shedding layers until reaching the core truth") rather than embodied contradiction or genuine struggle—her convictions shift smoothly without visible internal friction. Eleanor's function is supportive rather than applying pressure that forces Maria to alter stance. The final choice to name the sanctuary "Second Chance" arrives without a dramatized cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya's motivation to heal/understand scars is clear and her arc from "eraser" to "reader" is traceable, but the epiphany arrives through plant telepathy rather than earned dramatized pressure. Internal contradiction is present (wanting closure vs. opening wounds), yet the plants function as convenient wisdom-dispensers rather than forcing micro-choices. The therapy-speak peaks in "tunnel vision, focusing only on the surface without plumbing the depths" and "awareness" as the final beat label, pulling interiority toward diagnostic abstraction. Samuel's scene offers relational pressure but remains brief; the apology feels asserted more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The crystal gazer's motivation is clear and his spatial imagination creates a distinct perceptual signature, but interiority often drifts into abstraction ("concepts of them, embodied in the fleeting expressions") rather than embodied contradiction. The final peace feels unearned—no on-page micro-choice demonstrates what he gives up or forecloses by accepting his unused love as "contribution." Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions more as a conduit for ornamental mysticism than a character with embodied interior conflict. Her "cursed gift of hearing unspoken words" and stifled creativity are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final collapse and promise ("Soon") lack causal grounding in prior struggle; no genuine cost forecloses a path. Emotions are asserted ("gasped," "laughed," "breath hitched") without specific embodiment or POV-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The freight guard's dreamlessness functions as a motivated trait that enables archive navigation, and the seedling choice demonstrates agency with visible cost (one clock tick backward). However, interiority leans abstract—"emptiness," "consciousness," "quantum entanglement"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment ("heart carried the steady beat") gestures toward change but the transformation from dreamless void to emotional presence lacks on-page causality; we don't see what specific experience shifted him.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's interior is present but abstracted through philosophical musing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The translocation trait and gear handling provide some concrete action, but key moments lean on stock phrasing ("self-proclaimed stray philosopher," "consciousness itself had wandering feet"). The final transformation feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle; the gear rearranges "to match the pattern of Elian's neural network" without on-page cost or choice that forecloses a path. Name inconsistency (Elian/Elias/Elliot) breaks continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    The traveler remains a shadowy cipher throughout; no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is absent—we never enter the traveler's struggle or see choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The guides speak in identical elevated register ("gently persistent," "indirect routes," "unused courage") with therapeutic abstraction replacing character-particular thought. Agency at closure is passive reception (withdrawing light from a pool) rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bellhop's motivation to "understand the cost of safety" is signaled early but remains abstract; his discovery of the ledger triggers recognition rather than earned internal contradiction. Interior life relies on stock formulations: "heart raced," "mind racing," "cold, quiet fire." The final stance—"he would remain"—reads as acceptance but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path; we see resolve stated, not a choice that sacrifices something legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, but his interior life remains distant—we observe his actions more than inhabit his choices. The final confrontation shows agency (flicking the ink, speaking the rune), yet the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied; his emotional state under pressure is told more than shown. The "regally unpretentious" attribute is declared twice but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Backstory dominates the first half without anchoring in present micro-choices that tilt his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows consistent interiority tied to his past as a coral witness and present search for meaning, but his epiphany arrives through abstract pattern-matching rather than contradictory impulses forcing a costly choice. The protagonist endures isolation and reaches understanding, yet the final walk feels like release rather than foreclosure—no visible path is abandoned on the page. Embodiment is present (tapping rhythms, tide at ankles) but emotional progression leans toward philosophical acceptance without the friction of competing wants. The transformation reads more like intellectual discovery than character change earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior state is established through embodied detail (bare feet gripping concrete, opera glasses as physical anchor), but her emotional progression relies heavily on abstraction and label-like phrases ("awkwardly confident," "thunderous serenity"). The turn from doubt to purpose hinges on the stone circle hum, yet the mechanism feels ornamental rather than earned through prior contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her "spark" of purpose arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed, weakening the change's credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maeva's motivation to evolve tradition is stated clearly but her interior life reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The telepathic plant connection and her catering role are told, not shown through micro-choices under pressure. The final act of unsealing lacks visible personal cost—she succeeds without forfeiting anything on the page, and the "wave of potential" resolves too cleanly. Internal conflict is asserted ("insurgent spirit") but never dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's interiority is specific and embodied—the freeze response and trembling hands are somatically grounded. The trajectory from haunted survivor to placing the framed photograph reads as earned endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost. However, the emotional progression is too smooth; the leap from freezing in terror to transcendent stillness while transplanting sea thrift lacks the messy ambivalence or contradictory impulse that would push this higher. Therapy-speak touches ("somatic markers," "integrating") slightly flatten peak interiority but do not collapse the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The portrait artist's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("tapestry of what-ifs," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. The transformation from "crestfallen" to "something new, something remade" is asserted through repetitive declarations rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional progression reads as a smooth upward arc without the irrationality, hypocrisy, or self-deception that would ground the change. The final choice to paint "fractured truths" arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's obsession with time dilation is stated but his actions read as observation-driven rather than pressing choice under conflicting impulses. The "serene anger" is asserted repeatedly ("his anger simmering beneath the surface—not hot or loud, but serene") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The drone functions as extension rather than source of friction, and the ending epiphany ("Time slowed in crisis not because of physics, but because the mind fought to etch every detail into permanence") arrives as tidy realization without visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("he had lived too long in the margins, between what was seen and what was forgotten") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to provoke an unspoken conversation") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict; the phrase "bravely conflicted" appears as a label without embodied cost. Her decision to release the letter feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through on-page struggle—no micro-choices reveal competing values. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("her bravely conflicted soul," "the taste of freedom") instead of specific, embodied perception under pressure. The final "smile" and "heart finally at peace" resolve tension with convenient closure rather than felt ambiguity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear—she seeks peace through cultivation—but her choices never escalate into genuine dilemma. The piece tells us she's conflicted between her father's world and her own, yet no on-page moment forces her to choose between them with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("tranquil blaze," "weave continuity through chaos") rather than embodied contradiction. The final beat offers no forfeiture or earned renunciation, only a restatement of her existing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fisher's cool-headed nature is asserted rather than tested under genuine pressure; his emotions are transliterated into cosmic ritual without embodied contradiction or visible internal conflict. The motivation to catch the goddess's echo drives the ritual but lacks a dramatized cost that forecloses another path—loneliness is mentioned at the end rather than creating tension during the hunt. The final "satisfaction" arrives without visible trade-off or renunciation that would elevate the character work into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to discover hidden truths is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract through much of the piece. The "devotedly observant" trait is asserted rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to "print it" lacks embodied emotion or visible cost—she moves from suspicion to certainty too smoothly, without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The bent nib discovery and her father's teaching methods provide some grounding, but the character reads more as a vehicle for the mystery than a fully contradictory presence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orion's motivation—preserving his daughter's final sounds through haunted firmware—is embodied and specific, but the emotional arc is largely told through exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The guilt that drives him is legible, yet the key realization arrives via device translation rather than enacted choice under pressure. Micro-choices (touching the amber, preparing tomorrow's tattoo) are present but feel mechanically linked to backstory rather than wrestling with live contradiction. The final renunciation ("I tether you properly now") feels more ritual than a forfeiture that closes off a path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's socially perceptive trait and whimsical nature are asserted but her choices under pressure remain reactive rather than internally conflicted—she "needed to discover meaning" is declared motivation, and the mandala work reads as therapeutic process without visible competing impulses or trade-offs dramatized on the page. The tile flake drives her action but her decision to "interject into the unlearning" feels like a granted insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority leans toward labeled states ("lilac and anxiety," "reverent curiosity") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under stress. The ending smile and purpose-finding read as resolution without renunciation or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is evocative but remains abstract throughout; her contradiction as "gentle radical" is asserted more than dramatized through simultaneous competing impulses in scene. The retrocognitive trap functions primarily as background texture rather than constraining on-page choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("tessera's jagged edges bit into her skin") but interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("aberrant mercy") rather than concrete character-particular thought under pressure. The renaming action at closure feels more like ritual execution than a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    Arthur's encore-seeking nature is established early, but his interiority remains abstract—"rising nostalgia" and "encore-seeking nature transformed" are labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to place the coin feels unmotivated by prior struggle; no on-page micro-choice dramatizes the cost of letting go versus keeping the amplified power. The synesthesia trait is mentioned (tasting notes as citrus/chocolate) but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Emotional progression from despair to guardian feels summarized rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is established as an "affectionate skeptic" with a clear goal (map and silence the psychic static), but her interior remains abstract—she processes the telepathic intrusion through metaphor and art-project logic rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The somatic markers (chest tightening, thumb twitch) are mentioned but never dramatized as competing with her creative flow or forcing a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The final shift to "cartographer of the soul" reads as declared insight rather than earned renunciation, and no visible path is foreclosed with cost—she gains mastery without losing control, safety, or a prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to become the voice of the unknown") is clear and stated early, but her interior landscape defaults to stock metaphors ("purpose burned brighter," "heart pounding with newfound clarity") that flatten rather than embody emotion. The floating-fossil visions provide a micro-choice moment when she decides to move deeper, but the decision lacks contradictory impulses—she simply accepts the mystical event without doubt or cost. The laughing exclamation "She was no longer just a map maker; she was a conduit" reads as unearned epiphany, diagnostic self-labeling that shortcuts the struggle required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to spin a prophecy into raw possibility") but never tested by competing impulses or genuine costs. The button-cataloging method arrives as stated rather than discovered through struggle, and her "quietly inspired" stance remains label-only—no moment shows her suppressing excitement or choosing restraint over expression. The final turn ("fate was not a chain but a lattice of choices") reads as epiphany without prior misbelief dramatized on the page, and the "shared wisdom" mechanic bypasses her own friction entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (finding unused courage, fixing what's broken) is established but remains abstract through most of the piece. The core choice—creating a message for Althea and deciding to "vouchsafe" her freedom—arrives late and feels more resolved-in-reflection than wrestled-with on the page. Interiority leans heavily on philosophical abstraction ("unused courage waits, hoarded like a forgotten currency") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The renunciation carries stated weight but minimal dramatized cost; we're told he feels "whole" without seeing what he forfeited to get there.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman's interiority remains abstract and labeled rather than embodied—"spindrift serenity," "distill complexity into essence"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The brother's deathbed charge and the figure's arrival are told rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile feels unearned; no visible cost forecloses a path, only relief that the vigil has ended. Motivation stays declarative; we're told he waits to fulfill a promise but never see him wrestle with doubt or impatience that would make the choice credible.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to understand why places resist change is consistent and shapes his observation-led actions throughout. The interiority leans heavily on poetic abstractions ("phototropic to kindness," "zen patience") that risk label-only characterization, though the final choice—offering calm presence rather than force—aligns with established traits. The piece lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; Kael reads as wise and patient from start to finish, with no competing impulses to test his commitment. His final act is renunciation of repair in favor of understanding, which fits the arc but feels predetermined rather than hard-won under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The gardener's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains thin—no contradictory impulses emerge under pressure, only a single-note sensitivity about darkness. The "protected vulnerability" is asserted rather than dramatized through competing desires. Micro-choices (adjusting mirrors, packing tools) advance the project but reveal no internal cost or trade-off. The ending change—neighbors adopting his practice—feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract contemplation ("brittle awakenings," "crystalline shell around her heart") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final decision to "translate her knowledge" is declared rather than tested by competing pressures. Embodied emotion is absent; we get labels like "isolation" and "sorrow" but no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under stress. The single-POV frame is maintained, but the protagonist reads as a vessel for theme rather than a mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("thread that connected all things," "filament of pure meaning") rather than concrete, embodied contradiction. The climactic realization—that secrets are "tesserae" in a mosaic—arrives as declared epiphany without prior on-page struggle between contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ghostwriter profession is mentioned but never constrains a choice; we see no client interaction, no letter-writing pressure. Embodied emotion is thin: "felt a pull," "warming in his hand," "flood" of secrets—all tell rather than show physiological specificity under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a functional protagonist but lacks embodied contradiction or internal conflict. Her choices flow smoothly from competence to victory without genuine struggle or cost—she discovers the solution, implements it, and succeeds without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The "cautiously hopeful" attribute appears only as a label in narration rather than constraining decisions. Interiority relies on summary and telling ("she had to interfere") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    The explorer's claustrophobia is repeatedly stated but never constrains a choice or forces a visible trade-off; she simply "fights her instinct to flee" without embodied cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("wistful rebellion," "fierce determination") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character executes a complex technical procedure with no missteps, blind spots, or struggle beyond vague emotional hedging, reducing tension to declaration. The final "small smile" and neat transcendence undercut any genuine renunciation or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's face blindness creates a compelling structural irony—he reconstructs cold cases through fragments because he cannot recognize living faces. His methodical approach and the ritual of arriving "after the evidence disappears" establish consistent character traits. However, his motivation "to awaken dormant empathy in a world that had forgotten how to grieve for strangers" feels asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; we see him work but never struggle with whether this act matters or costs him something tangible. The final decision to leave the portrait anonymously lacks visible stakes or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to honor his ancestor is signaled early and shapes his choices, but his internal life relies heavily on abstract labels ("nervously confident," "spongey dread") rather than embodied contradictions. The decision at the climax—twisting the nail to dangerous coordinates—feels somewhat unmotivated because the journal's warning about silence versus discovery is gestured at but not dramatized as a genuine dilemma with visible cost. Interiority often tells emotional state rather than showing perception under pressure, and the final choice reads more as plot mechanics than character-driven renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "dynamically observant" trait is claimed but rarely constrains action with visible cost. Her decision to pursue the mystery feels unmotivated beyond curiosity—no competing need, fear, or internal contradiction shapes her choice to return daily. The hitchhiker and later glass-fragment collectors remain generic figures who apply no relational pressure. The ending's turn to "bridge between possibilities" arrives as an epiphany unearned by prior struggle or sacrifice visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jasper's polished calm is established consistently, but his internal contradictions remain abstract rather than embodied in scene. The father's legacy motivates investment and sanctuary-building, yet pivotal choices (investing the inheritance, leaving the startup) occur with such smooth detachment that the visible cost is muted. Elena's arc from visionary to manipulator is told efficiently but lacks the friction of on-page conflict that would dramatize her pressure on Jasper's stance. The final weeks-later reflection with Elena offers conceptual closure but minimal embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions is established, but her choices remain reactive throughout—she witnesses, asks, listens. The professor drives the key revelation; Elara's "healing words" trait is asserted twice but never dramatized with visible cost or constraint. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from anxiety to understanding without embodied struggle or micro-choices that foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The druid's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("layers of wilderness wisdom," "frozen confession") rather than embodied contradiction. The guilt-driven motivation is told in summary at the climax ("he had loved and lost, and the guilt had frozen him in place") instead of emerging through micro-choices under pressure. The "guarded heart now open" resolution feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is largely linear summary without credible irrationality or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal state shows embodied contradiction ("anxious elation, a buoyant dread"), and his scar-matching choice at the oak is earned by prior visions. However, the moment of insight at the nexus—"the future hadn't broken the covenant out of malice; it had broken it because it was lonely"—reads as convenient diagnostic clarity rather than struggle. The resolution (holding up his scarred hand as "proof of connection") operates more as symbolic gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward poetic label ("root-bound visionary") without sufficient micro-choices under pressure to ground transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's recklessness is asserted ("reckless idealist") but his choices feel guided by ritual mechanics rather than internal conflict. The stranger's soul appears only as echo without genuine dramatic friction. Emotional states are labeled ("heart heavy," "resolve hardening") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation ("soul no longer tattered but stitched") arrives without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("wrest this story from the silence," the memory of gaffer-taping torn cloth). The epiphany that his career ended "when he'd stopped caring about what happened after the applause" arrives abruptly without prior contradiction or micro-choices showing him torn between technical perfection and soul. The final resolve feels slightly unearned because the "after the applause" realization is declared rather than dramatized through a visible renunciation or trade-off that forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dr. Maris exhibits consistent traits (methodical, analogical thinking) but her emotional arc relies heavily on label-speak ("touching distance," "renewed purpose") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to plant the seed feels predetermined rather than a choice that forecloses a visible alternative path. Interior reflection dominates over dramatized micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values with cost. Hamid's spectral presence is told retrospectively without creating on-page pressure through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    The librarian exists primarily as a vessel for worldbuilding rather than a character who makes choices under pressure. The identity-shifting (Elias/Elara) is told rather than dramatized—we're informed they "had been" and "would become" but never witness a migration that forecloses options or creates visible cost. The interiority consists almost entirely of abstract reflection on their centuries-old existence rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful decision alters the librarian's state by the end; they simply complete a ritual loop that preserves the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivations remain abstract—"abandoned hopes" and "walls between hearts" are told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The pearl "works its magic" without dramatized internal conflict; his shift from isolated inspector to community facilitator feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on thematic labels ("professional armor," "emotional fortresses") instead of concrete, character-particular thought. The final choice to continue carrying seashells lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's internal state is clear—grief, the fog of medication lifting, the need for self-forgiveness—but key choices feel more symbolic than dramatic. The accordion toss lacks setup as a genuine trade-off; he releases it without prior dramatized attachment or a scene where keeping it would cost him something concrete. "Daringly methodical" is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible friction. Embodied emotion appears (spray misting his face, cold metal on knees) but the epiphany that forgiveness is "something to become" arrives as neat articulation rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains an abstract observer without embodied conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "understanding" and "observation" are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final realization that "she had been part of the library all along" arrives as assertion without prior causal grounding in her actual decisions. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply steps back through with the watch ready to guide her again.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clementine's research-driven interiority is present but her peak choice—leaving with the violin—feels insufficiently motivated by prior on-page causality. The telepathy with plants appears as a label with one functional beat (blooming acceleration) but doesn't generate contradictory impulses or visible cost in the decision to flee. Internal conflict is asserted ("weigh a dream against an empire") rather than embodied through competing desires acting simultaneously under pressure. The final act forecloses a path, but the choice reads more as plot necessity than earned character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The beautician mortician's motivation ("to capture one last spark") is clearly stated but not tested by competing desires or internal friction. Her practiced method unfolds without meaningful doubt or cost to herself—no skill failure, no personal price for the extraction, no visible tradeoff. The voyager is inert, so no relationship pressure exists. Interiority remains abstract ("profound quiet," "familiar weight") rather than embodied contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caretaker's motivation (seeking contentment) and core trait (kindly decisive) remain label-only across most beats; interiority consists largely of abstract reflections ("forgiving the unforgivable," "cycle of rebirth") without embodied contradiction or moment-to-moment choice friction. The epiphany at the tree ("contentment isn't something to be found… it's something cultivated") arrives as direct statement rather than earned through specific struggle, and the final welcome to the new soul reads as generic rather than character-particular. The protagonist's decisions do not foreclose paths with visible cost; she performs ritual actions without internal conflict or consequence that would validate the claimed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's "cloak of doubt" is established as both condition and tool, but remains somewhat abstract; his interior during the chime-selection beat shows professional care yet lacks embodied contradiction acting simultaneously. Lyra's "sincerely insincere" trait is declared more than dramatized—her tears and posture shift read as performed emotion rather than contradictory impulses in conflict. The brother exists only in reference, which limits relational pressure. Minor penalty for diagnostic phrasing ("protected vulnerability" as method label).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's backwards aging remains ornamental—it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Elara's motivations are told ("patience a match for his cryptic lessons") rather than tested under pressure. The epiphany ("to vanish is to become the ripples") arrives without prior contradiction or visible cost; she simply watches and then understands. Interiority is thin and arrives in abstract declarations rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his characterization as a "harmonic stone skimmer" is consistently filtered through his perceptual signature. Interiority remains specific ("he felt their vibrations, their place in the grand, silent song") but the final epiphany ("navigation without movement wasn't about seeing; it was about attuning") reads as somewhat over-articulated enlightenment rather than fully embodied discovery under pressure. The shift from captivity to freedom via insight lacks visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the ending suggests liberation without credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his embodied responses during mist walking carry adequate texture ("cold air stinging his lungs"). The final choice—placing the keystone—is set up by years of searching but the on-page cost is largely conceptual ("memory of authentic creation") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece tells us he's found what he seeks without dramatizing a meaningful sacrifice or a renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orion's motivation is told rather than tested in scene—his quest to "discover the color of sound" anchors the entire arc but his internal contradiction (grief versus obsession) never forces a costly micro-choice on the page. The final synesthetic breakthrough arrives as a delivered epiphany ("a soft violet blue that hummed with crescents of gold") without embodied struggle or forfeited path. The brother's death remains backstory scaffolding; no present friction makes Orion choose between competing goods. Interiority relies on abstract descriptor phrases ("the only honest measure of human intention") rather than concrete, character-particular perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt") rather than embodied contradiction. Her decision-making at closure—casting lots to encode prophecies—feels more like cosmic ritual than a choice constrained by competing impulses. The "wavelength finally aligned with cosmic purpose" resolution reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a renunciation or endurance with visible cost. Motivation remains declarative throughout; no micro-choice under pressure reveals her hierarchy of values with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    The reaper's grief is embodied through physical trembling and breath hitching, and the naming ritual forces concrete choices under pressure. However, the interiority frequently slides into abstract label-speak ("Longing," "Regret," "Despair") that reads diagnostic rather than lived. The final transformation—"no longer broken, but scarred—tougher, softer, human"—arrives as assertion rather than dramatized contradiction. The micro-choices (placing the page, naming each monster) do narrow options incrementally, but the emotional progression feels more like therapeutic stages than ambiguous struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's "lukewarm magic" and "brittle devotion" are label-asserted rather than earned through contradictory on-page impulses. His motivations remain abstract ("cosmic imbalance") without visceral stakes that force trade-offs; the drip-rate method feels like a device rather than a constraint arising from character limits. The ending choice—walking away after partial success—lacks visible cost; we don't see what path is foreclosed or what he sacrifices beyond effort already spent. Embodied emotion is thin; his "heart racing" and "breath hitching" are generic reactions rather than character-specific physiological signatures under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The warden's motivation to "spin stories into shared meaning" is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("expunge the past," "collective storytelling") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ritual of placing photographs proceeds without visible internal friction or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The final smile and departure feel resolved without the protagonist having foreclosed a live option through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are consistently rooted in her three-decade pursuit of harmonizing logic and intuition, and the "secretly sentimental" trait appears when she notes the crystal's anniversary significance. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical claims ("pure, unadulterated understanding") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final transformation choice feels inevitable given her stated goals, but no visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path—she simply succeeds, and the "no longer afraid" declaration tells rather than dramatizes internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    The seeker remains an abstraction—"attentively inventive" and "motivation pulsed beneath their ribs" are labels without contradiction or embodied choice. The leap at the end feels like demonstration rather than a decision earned by prior pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("preserve trust under pressure") and stock phrasing ("prayers, revisions of a life spent watching"). The parachute buckle relic is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to defeat numbness is asserted but rarely embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The clone exists primarily as philosophical mirror rather than applying immediate relational pressure; their exchange feels thesis-driven ("You feel nothing" / "You feel too much") rather than goal-pursuit with subtext. The final choice to "pour his will" into the jar reads as abstract exertion without the bodily cost or tactical trade-off that would ground it. Interiority leans heavily on diagnostic phrasing ("ego death survival," "emotional numbness," "fugue of disbelief") in place of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's grief-driven motivation is established early and his physical actions (yanking cord, singing, pressing closer) are embodied. The "mournfully eager" contradiction operates on the page through simultaneous desperation and hope. However, the final sequence—motes of light simply floating home while he watches passively—undercuts agency at closure; he becomes observer rather than active participant in the resolution. The grandmother's wind-remembering method is mentioned but never tested or complicated by doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sylvan's motivation is articulated through internal contradiction ("make friends with uncertainty"), and the pendant encounter forces a micro-choice to internalize rather than shatter. However, the character remains abstract—we observe his philosophical stance but lack embodied emotion or a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "content" declaration feels asserted rather than earned through struggle. The piece operates more as essay than dramatized agency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior state is established through his "stoically sensitive hands" and thirteen years of failure, but the characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("hopeless alchemist by trade and birthright") rather than concrete contradictory impulses in scene. The turning point—his realization about creative destruction—arrives as a declared epiphany ("the clarity that only comes when desperation finally shatters illusion") rather than emerging from a specific on-page choice that forecloses a prior path. The final stance feels asserted through reflection rather than earned through visible cost in action, and the protagonist's agency reads more as internal narration than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior voice is consistently established through his interpretive lens ("Silence isn't absence...It's information too"), but motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The "find the beginning in every ending" desire is stated but never tested against a credible cost or alternative path; his trajectory feels like a predetermined meditation rather than a choice under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin—no visceral contradiction or struggle surfaces when the signal resolves, just confirmation. The ending's smile and understanding arrive without prior friction that would make renunciation or acceptance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elijah's motivation is stated clearly (merge timelines), but his interior life remains thin—polishing brass, adjusting frequencies, reassuring passengers—without embodied contradiction or a hierarchy of competing impulses. The "resiliently positive" trait is labeled repeatedly rather than tested by a micro-choice that reveals cost. The final satisfaction ("genuine satisfaction, his mission accomplished") feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a credible alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Siran's internal state is conveyed through abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"itching to touch," "chest tight with awe" are serviceable but generic. The arc from precision to abandon is stated more than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The "fever dream architect" role remains a label; we never see the occupational detail constrain a choice or reveal hierarchy of values through gesture. The final smile and walk-away read as summary rather than a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear internal motivation—volunteering for the starlight navigation program—but his interiority trends toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The students remain undifferentiated, functioning as audience rather than applying pressure through status dynamics or conflicting goals. The final moment where Elias "felt the somber marvel of their situation most profoundly" tells rather than dramatizes the emotional shift, and his decision to teach has already been made before the story opens, leaving no on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria's "persistently curious nature" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic discovery (documents in the music box) arrives via her equipment rather than through a choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("profound gratitude," "incidental heroism") instead of embodied contradiction. The final moment summarizes her emotional state rather than showing a micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eliza's claustrophobia is mentioned but never constrains a choice—paradoxically she feels "free" underwater, which undercuts the trait's dramatic potential. Her mentor's disappearance and the codex provide backstory motivation, but her decision to "dissolve" and join the trapped consciousness lacks embodied hesitation or visible cost in the moment; the transition reads as acceptance without struggle. Internal contradiction is present (spelunker fearing confinement vs. finding freedom in pressure) but remains告知 rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The final "calling" feels declared rather than earned through on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to help Aris defragment memories is clearly established, but his interiority remains thin throughout—heartbeat counting is a label-only trait without visible psychological cost or trade-off. Aris as a digital ghost supplies concept more than character pressure; her miscalculation backstory is told rather than dramatized through on-page contradictory impulses. The final exchange ("count my heartbeats too") gestures toward emotional closure but lacks the embodied tension or micro-choice that would earn it. The piece fulfills basic motivation but misses the internal contradiction and hierarchy of values required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and sustained—preserving a dying language through texture-to-sound translation—but remains largely unopposed by internal contradiction. The copper veins provide embodied specificity, yet choices feel predetermined rather than forced under competing impulses. The final "smile" and understanding arrive without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Competence overwhelms struggle; Kaelen succeeds smoothly, which undercuts the Q1 quick test for contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (sister's loss driving his quest to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") is established but remains abstract; the final drop of the arrowhead feels more resigned than earned through on-page contradiction. The Jester's "gravitationally playful influence" turning rage into fizz reads as convenience rather than dramatic struggle. Lyra's sudden recognition and her line "I thought I buried that for good" arrives without prior setup, weakening her credibility. Internal conflict is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The violinist's interior life is present but largely declarative ("she had forgotten why she played"), lacking the embodied contradiction that would elevate pressure. The decision to play and stand her ground reads as motivated by symbolic logic rather than a specific hierarchy of values with visible cost. Emotional states are asserted through metaphor ("grief sharpened its edges like a blade") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to drop the shell and walk away feels thematically complete but misses the micro-choices under duress that would make the stance crystallization earn its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and embodied through his actions with the shuttle, the bottle, and the concealed book. Interior contradiction appears when his "quiet constant drum" to heal broken promises drives him to methodically break rules, creating respectful rebellion that reads as character-specific. The tissue-sample mission demonstrates micro-choices under pressure with visible cost (risk of detection, spent storm-bottle). However, the brother's absence remains tell-only backstory that anchors motivation but never complicates a present choice or creates friction within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation to restore and reclaim silence is established, but the transformation from silent carpenter to singing feels unearned—no prior micro-choices or internal friction dramatize why this particular moment breaks decades of silence. The interiority leans heavily on abstract language ("silence had become both his language and his canvas") rather than embodied contradiction. The halo fragment acts as a convenience device that instantly grants voice without visible psychological cost or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    The librarian remains a static cipher throughout; her "sanely eccentric" nature is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The scarf's tightening and the portal crossing are narrated rather than felt as stakes that foreclose options. Interiority consists of abstract metaphysical declarations ("The stories lived here, not as words, but as living geometries") rather than character-particular perception. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost emerges—she completes her "mission" without any trade-off or genuine struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    The librarian remains abstract—his choices never embody contradiction or genuine internal conflict. Motivation is declared ("to capture a runaway dream") but never tested by competing desires or costs that force a visible trade-off. The palette's success arrives without struggle or failure; no blindspot drives a compounding mistake. Interiority relies on stock poetic phrasing ("luminous absence," "liquid memory") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith remains abstract—"unassumingly bold" is asserted but never tested through a difficult on-page choice with visible cost. His humming method proceeds without internal conflict or risk; the breakthrough arrives via stated resonance rather than earned struggle. The client's absence removes relational pressure, leaving the protagonist unopposed. Interiority consists largely of ornamental perception ("impossible color," "glass harmonica note") that describes process without revealing contradictory impulses or a hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are established (recover stolen memories, understand her draw to this place), but interiority leans heavily on expository reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The climax choice—"I'll help"—arrives via exposition dump from the light-beings rather than earned dramatized struggle. Emotions are often labeled ("chronic curiosity," "eager anticipation") instead of shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final alignment of "both selves" reads as tidy resolution without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to mentor through exile is established, but her interior remains thin—backward walking functions as a label more than embodied constraint. Marcus materializes with "thoughtful lines around his eyes" but no contradictory impulses or struggle in the reunion beat. The reunion dialogue ("You banished me to save me") names the epiphany rather than dramatizing resistance or cost, flattening what should be the pivotal character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elianor's motivation to preserve the Chroma Blossom is clear and rooted in generational purpose, but her emotional journey remains largely serene without internal contradiction or struggle. The "insatiably creative mind" is asserted in line 2 but never manifests as a micro-choice under pressure—she proceeds smoothly through a practiced ritual. The final "fierce, quiet joy" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or visible cost. No flaws or blind spots complicate the execution; the protagonist operates with flawless competence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias displays consistent motivation (mask restorer who sees beyond surfaces) and the final act of freeing spirits is earned by his methodical approach. However, interiority relies heavily on tell ("lucid unrest churning in his chest") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. Anna's role feels functional rather than pressured; her pacing and explanations serve exposition more than personal stake. The shift from "his" to "I saw them daily in my shop" breaks POV discipline mid-paragraph without structural justification.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is characterized through his occupation and "methodically curious" trait, but these remain largely label-only. His motivation "to interpret silence with empathy" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The final "discovery" moment lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives—he simply perceives what he sought. Internal conflict is absent; no competing desires complicate his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life shows analytic focus and a clear quest pattern, but his motivation remains abstract—"understanding release" feels label-heavy rather than rooted in embodied contradiction. The shift from studying transmissions to accepting "some threads aren't meant to be untangled" reads as an epiphany delivered rather than earned through competing impulses acting in scene. Arthur functions primarily as a foil who articulates insights rather than applying pressure that forces micro-choices with visible cost. The final "quiet tiredness" softens rather than complicates the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The balladeer's motivation—articulating unspoken needs—is established but remains abstract rather than embodied through conflicting impulses. Interior state relies heavily on stock mystical imagery ("driftingly alert," "suspended in that strange timeless moment") without character-particular contradiction. The ghost relationship is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending returns him to prior state with a smile, suggesting satisfaction rather than earned renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "warmly inquisitive nature" is asserted but never acts as a constraint or generator of micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" arrives as declaration in paragraph three without prior embodiment or conflict. The final step through the elevator doors reads as acceptance of a pre-scripted role rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("affectionate detachment from the pain") rather than particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is given a conceptual obsession (categorizing clouds by emotion, proving empty spaces remember) but his moment-to-moment choices remain observational rather than pressured. The father's death and the cable severance are told in flashback or summary, never forcing on-page contradiction or trade-off. The final whisper and journal entry assert resolution without dramatizing a cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical declarations ("spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (paint the impossible sky, cope with face blindness through pattern) is stated but never meaningfully tested or contradicted. The "discovering limits" premise could have forced a trade-off—time versus perfection, safety versus completion—but he succeeds without visible cost or internal friction. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart pounding," "hands trembling" are stock phrases that flatten peak moments. The final walk-away reads as declarative summary rather than earned transformation rooted in on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined primarily through labels ("diligently curious," "sociable isolation") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His discovery unfolds as intellectual epiphany without embodied struggle or visceral cost—the "trembling hands" gesture remains token. The final transformation from apprentice to "keeper of stranded luminance" is asserted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on abstract motivation ("unshakeable motivation to chart") without micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation remains abstract throughout—"rhythm of repair" never crystallizes into a concrete decision with visible cost. Her interior life consists of poetic declarations rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene: "she'd been searching for this moment forever" tells us drive without showing the friction that would make it credible. The closure choice (assembling gears) feels unmotivated because no prior beat established why *this* locksmith would succeed where others failed, or what personal capability she risked. Tears freeze on her lashes as pure sentiment without embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The Gardener operates entirely as told-through device; no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle. Elara and Kael are names attached to functions (noticer, decoder) without distinct interior texture or embodied stakes. The "becoming family" premise and final choice to tend gardens lack visible cost or prior friction—the transformation is asserted across years in summary, not earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Motivation remains label-only altruism with no dramatized tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The adjuster's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("bruised awe," "profound privilege") rather than embodied sensation. No meaningful internal conflict appears; the character executes a predetermined task without hesitation or cost to his own stance. The final "thought" is pure summary rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Tomas exhibits agency through constructed device and blood-curse manipulation, and his "nearly-living" state generates internal tension. His competence ("offhandedly exact manner") is dramatized through assembly work. However, interiority leans toward label-heavy constructions ("morning sickness had never quite left," "curse-birthed paradox") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final choice to gather the device and return lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—he simply continues the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her decision to create the variant polymer demonstrates agency with cost. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract scientific metaphors ("symphonically minded," "molecular structures as melodies") that read as labels rather than embodied thought under pressure. The crucial insight at the ravine arrives through observation rather than conflict-driven choice, and the grief that "loosens" lacks the contradictory impulses that would make the transformation feel earned. The brother Marco remains an off-page stake without relationship dynamics to test Elena's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias exhibits minimal internal contradiction; his role as "keeper of endings" is established but never tested by genuine conflict between want and cost. The two customers function identically—both extend hands, both receive incisions, both leave blank—flattening any sense of individual motivation or embodied struggle. The woman's question "Do you ever regret this?" lands as pure exposition rather than earned inquiry, and Elias's reply ("Regret is just another story waiting to be bottled") reads as thematic placeholder rather than character-specific thought under pressure. Interiority remains abstract ("his clean slate untroubled by the trade") with no micro-choices that reveal competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is clearly established (need to dull specific memories), but his actions largely unfold without embodied contradiction or struggle. The gift of tasting memories and emotional contagion remains label-only until the closure; no on-page micro-choice tests these traits under pressure before the pavilion scene. Interior texture defaults to stock phrasing ("heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird") and therapy-adjacent exposition ("desperate need to sandpaper rough memories"). The final return grants relief without a visible cost or foreclosed path—his gift remains, the pain is dulled, but no dilemma or renunciation accompanies the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's characterization is label-heavy ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetically decisive") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation to "construct bridges from silos" is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no internal friction appears on the page. The fifteen-year backstory and her nightly ritual are recounted but never tested by a live choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Emotional states remain static and summarized rather than embodied through action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara remains purely cerebral throughout—her "helix-minded" approach and "quaking reverie" are asserted repeatedly but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The text tells us she's "designed not for this world but for what this world had been unable to become" without dramatizing the cost of that alienation. No relationship pressure exists; no secondary character tests her conviction. The transformation is declared complete rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "prism-mind" is deployed as label rather than lived contradiction; we see observations refracted but no competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her motivation to "restore balance to a world tilting toward dangerous myopia" arrives as abstract thesis rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final paragraph claims "expanded consciousness" without on-page cost or foreclosed path—she walks home carrying prize boxes with no visible trade-off. Emotional progression is telescoped through therapy-adjacent phrasing ("latent blaze of purpose") that replaces embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eliara's motivation is stated but never tested through meaningful conflict or contradiction. Her "empathy in motion" and "symphonically minded" traits appear as labels rather than enacted tensions that complicate choice. The ending resolves without visible cost or change—she fulfills her motive without forfeiting anything, and the sculpture will "sing again" with no indication that her stance or knowledge has shifted. The hedgehog and grove remain decorative rather than applying relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains largely static throughout, observing and meditating rather than making choices that alter his stance. His interior life is told through abstract labels ("thoughtfully precise," "hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "peace" arrives as assertion, not earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Therapy-speak phrases like "channel each feeling into understanding" flatten what should be a decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silen's interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("eclectic pacifist," "theatrical yet sincere") repeated as summary rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The motivation to catalog silence is asserted but never tested by a conflicting desire or limit that would force a visible trade-off. Micro-choices (adjusting knobs, hovering fingers) exist but carry no felt cost or consequence beyond advancing toward the unlocking. The final "trembling hands" gesture and smile feel performed rather than earned by prior struggle, and no path is foreclosed with on-page weight.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's herbalist identity and olfactory gift are established, but her choices remain largely observational rather than forcing trade-offs. The multi-month time compression reduces embodied stakes to summary ("Three weeks passed"), flattening the pressure that would make her devotion feel costly. Finn's introduction and the village's gradual involvement provide relational texture, but the lack of internal contradiction or meaningful resistance—everything unfolds as hoped—prevents the final "understanding" from reading as earned transformation versus reflective narration. The closing seed-distribution feels generous rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to discover the orchard's resilience source is signaled early and drives her navigation, but her interiority remains abstract—"her mind racing with implications" tells rather than embodies thought under pressure. The arrow-tip discovery triggers a visible plant-growth surge, yet her response is largely observational; no micro-choice forces a trade-off between competing goods. The final "promise of resilience forged in chaos" reads as unearned epiphany rather than embodied cost, and the therapeutic framing ("a lesson," "a student of the echoes") flattens agency into passive reception.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is defined primarily through his occupation and retrospective framing rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior texture relies heavily on his "rapidly adapting mind" and "hazy precision" labels without embodied tension—these become thesis statements rather than dramatized traits. The final discovery sequence shows professional competence but no visible cost or foreclosed path; he remains in observer mode throughout. The flight engineer's patch appears as symbolic freight rather than a character-specific choice driver.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("their synesthetic soul at peace") and therapeutic self-awareness ("certify wonder as essential") without embodied struggle. The bell ringer's actions follow a straight line to success with no genuine flaws complicating the task; there is no internal conflict operating simultaneously in scene, only serial description of sensory perception. The final "task complete" moment arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Keeper's motivation is clear—seeking understanding from past failure—and the internal contradiction between shame and determination operates throughout. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("harvest insights from failure," "understanding required not contemplation but confrontation") rather than embodied, moment-to-moment tension. The realization about rigidity versus flow arrives as an epiphany delivered in summary rather than earned through dramatic pressure. The character's micro-choices (placing driftwood, uncasing the flute) do advance the journey, but the pivotal shift happens in exposition rather than through conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Silas's core trait—borrowing personalities—is present but underexplored at pivotal beats. His motivations shift between transposed empathy as mathematical framework and genuine connection without clear internal friction. The climactic moment when he "feels his borrowed personalities peel away" reads as told epiphany rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. Embodied contradiction is absent; he processes revelation smoothly without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courier's nervous energy is established early and transforms purposefully by the end, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("profound connection," "seeds of memory") rather than embodied contradiction. The mentor's absence shapes motivation, yet the courier's choices feel more receptive than driven by competing impulses—he adjusts straps, encounters a hare, meets a hermit, all without visible internal conflict in the moment. The final transformation is declared ("moved differently now") rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Backstory exceeds the default allowance but remains anchored to present stimuli; however, the reflective mode flattens on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has a clear scholarly motivation to prove objects absorb emotions, and the piece grounds him physically (bare feet on stone, forehead against quartz). However, his interior life relies heavily on abstract mystical language rather than embodied contradiction—he feels impressions and catalogs sensations without genuine struggle or cost until the end. The final "certainty that settled deep in his bones" reads as an unearned epiphany; no visible foreclosure of a path occurs, and the "truthful lies" framing suggests he constructs his own proof without dramatized tension between want and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to reach her brother is declared but never tested by on-page choices that force trade-offs. Her "wistful" quality and the brother's disappearance are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or specific memory that shapes present action. The weaving sequence describes effort ("fingers bleeding") but never shows what she risks or forecloses—no decision point where she must choose between competing goods. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("wistful resolve," "latent sacrifice") rather than concrete thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is signaled early (meek blacksmith with "quietly determined fire"), but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels: "azure defiance," "bartered awakening," "quietly determined nature." The cavern work unfolds through summary rather than embodied struggle—"hours passed" compresses the transformation into a single declarative beat. His final posture shift ("not meek, not proud, but purposefully transformed") reads as diagnostic label-speak rather than an earned contradiction shown through micro-choices. The piece withholds on-page emotional contradiction or genuine vulnerability that would make the change costly.

    Kael's motivation to discover withheld truth is stated but never dramatized through competing impulses or visible internal conflict. The younger-self encounter lacks embodied emotion—he observes and nudges probability without visceral hesitation or cost beyond "agonizing" pull-back. Interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("cartographer of his own soul," "profound resonance") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final shift from haunted to "solid, real" is told rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Jonah's reticence is established but his interior world consists largely of observation without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "warmly observant nature" trait remains label-only; we're told he notices details but never see a moment where this trait constrains a choice or creates friction. The final action—placing sea glass and stacking stones—feels like symbolic gesture rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. His emotional progression from isolation to connection is asserted through summary reflection rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kaelen remains largely abstract—a collection of labels ("storm herald," "laughing") without contradictory impulses driving scene choices. His "motivation" to influence humanity is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma that forces a visible trade-off. The piece tells us he performs routine for a thousand years and finds "elation," yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values or embodied emotion. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("beautiful chaos," "ancient wisdom") rather than character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is specific and embodied through his dye-master observations, with his heart's rhythm quickening at the wing's shimmer providing concrete physical anchoring. The progression from question to purpose is earned through weeks of sustained attention. Minor deduction: the donor remains abstract—no contradictory impulses complicate his inquiry, and the final shift feels more cerebral than visceral. The renunciation of "motivation to solve" for "compulsion to honor" lands cleanly but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation to discover what trees witness is clear and sustained, but the protagonist remains observational rather than conflicted. Internal contradiction is absent; Elian proceeds methodically through research without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The final "trembling hands" gesture attempts embodied emotion but arrives too late to establish a pattern of contradictory desire under pressure. No meaningful cost forecloses a path—Elian continues maintenance work unchanged, smiling at secret knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper's motivation to rekindle the realm through song is established but remains abstract; his scattered memories are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The protagonist's final choice to release the light feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through visible internal conflict. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("his scattered memories sharpening into focus") without embodied sensation or character-particular thought patterns. The mention of prior failure adds stakes but is summarized in a subordinate clause rather than shown as a живой wound that complicates present action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's empathetic nature is established but remains largely label-driven rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. The backstory about the therapeutic mistake is told extensively rather than filtered through present pressure. The final choice to attend the gathering feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle—she moves "with deliberate acceptance" without visible cost or competing desire actively tested in scene. Internal conflict is summarized (isolation vs. duty) rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory actions.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's character is established through her role as "creeping normality noticer" and her ritual behaviors, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract observation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The baker's arrival offers potential for genuine interaction, but their exchange remains surface-level—she offers bread, he takes it, no competing impulses complicate the gesture. The final "stirring of something like hope" reads as a label rather than a dramatized shift earned through on-page cost. Motivation is present but not tested by meaningful internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "gently meticulous nature" is asserted repeatedly but never forces a trade-off or creates contradiction. Her work proceeds without obstacle, internal conflict, or cost—she simply measures vows and succeeds. The final "gently meticulous hand" reprise reads as label recycling rather than earned character revelation. No embodied emotion or micro-choice under genuine pressure appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emmie's motivation is clear and consistent—protect the community and avenge her father—but interiority relies heavily on summary ("her determination unwavering") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "comforting unease" label appears without dramatic texture showing what that paradox feels like in a charged moment. Internal conflict is asserted more than enacted; we're told she's steadfast but don't see her wrestle with doubt or cost until the final decision, which lands cleanly but arrives late. The three failed attempts feel mechanical rather than psychologically distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "luminous skeptic" label is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her shift from skepticism to acceptance arrives through exposition ("finally understanding") rather than embodied choice under pressure. The weather-carrier concept remains abstract—skin glow and taste changes are described but never constrain a difficult decision with visible cost. Internal voice relies heavily on explanatory narration ("her body's natural response," "subconsciously") that tells rather than shows embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to reclaim his art is clear, but interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("hollow ache," "fierce, cathartic release") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to resume his art feels inevitable from the opening, with no visible internal conflict or competing impulse dramatized in scene. The mnemonic gift is label-only; it never constrains a choice or creates a tactical problem on the page. Emotional progression is asserted through metaphor rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's physical wilting response to dishonesty provides a concrete constraint, and her decision to distribute the messages shows agency under pressure. However, her internal contradictions remain underdeveloped—the piece tells us she depends on candor but doesn't dramatize competing impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments. Marius's confession arrives conveniently late, and his motivations (hoping she wouldn't find the fragment while visiting her workspace regularly) lack embodied tension. The final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    The bell tuner remains abstract throughout; "seasonally mute" is declared but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority consists of generic observations ("his heart pounding a rhythm") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist observes and arranges rather than making a difficult decision that forecloses a path, leaving motivation label-only. No internal conflict dramatized; the piece tells us he preserves wonder without showing what he sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    L-734's internal conflict is present but often told through abstract labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The android's "emotional subroutines were fragmenting" and "inner static" are diagnostic labels that flatten what could be embodied tension. The final shift—"not a deletion but an integration"—arrives without sufficient prior causality showing how fear transforms into "protective membranes." Micro-choices exist (retrieving the box, placing the seed) but the cost of each choice remains vague, undermining the earned-change requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation—"to prove that listening heals"—reads as thesis rather than embodied contradiction. His "discerning curator" role generates no internal friction or cost; the neighbors' tales arrive as convenient data points without resistance or misunderstanding. The final vow to continue Mrs. Leclair's work lands as declarative resolution with no visible foreclosed path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("sharp motivation," "comforting weight") and the epiphany arrives unearned, lacking the prior causality of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear—liberating her mentor—but her execution feels competence-without-struggle. The guards' "momentary trance" and the dice rolling "exactly the sequence she needed" strip agency from meaningful friction. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through obstacles as if choreographed rather than choosing under genuine pressure. The "calm defiance" reads as label rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to recover lost memories is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on mystical-systems exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The recovery process unfolds without meaningful internal resistance or cost—she performs the ritual and seventeen memories return by dawn with no visible struggle or trade-off that alters her stance. The final paragraph's "universal longing to reclaim what has been lost" reads as thematic summary rather than earned insight from specific struggle. Micro-choices during the ritual (chanting, pouring coffee grounds) advance plot mechanically without revealing competing impulses or forcing a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The summoner's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("tranquil blaze," "mapping silence") rather than embodied contradiction or concrete micro-choices under pressure. The prophecy motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; we see only smooth execution without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "satisfaction" reads as summary rather than earned change through on-page friction. No secondary character is present to test relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor's motivation to listen to buildings is clear, but her interiority remains generic—"her heart raced" is stock phrasing. The relationship with Elias serves mainly as a vehicle for exposition rather than a crucible forcing contradictory impulses. The final choice to share the secret lacks visible cost; Elias simply accepts and listens, creating a soft resolution without foreclosing options or testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to understand quarantined memories is clear, but her interior remains abstract—"charmed skeptic" and "ghostly resolve" are labels more than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ritual unfolds without genuine struggle or mistake; she moves through the steps competently, and no cost is paid until the very end when "isolation transmuted into independence" is asserted rather than dramatized. Embodied emotion is sparse; we never feel her chest tighten beyond the opening line, and the peak beats (activating crystals, walking through memories) lack visceral stakes or embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through craft details (the ink formula, the forged confession), but her interior contradiction remains largely told rather than acted. The heritage rose thorn functions more as symbolic trigger than a choice-constraining object. The final "lighter than she had in years" reads as therapeutic resolution rather than a flawed character navigating genuine ambiguity. Micro-choices exist (pricking her finger, adding blood to the seal) but the emotional arc smooths too quickly from bitterness to relief without on-page struggle at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaelen's perceptiveness is established but operates mostly as observational talent rather than generating contradictory impulses under pressure. His choices—singing the warning—flow predictably from his skillset without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The final stance ("people echo when they refuse to be silenced") reads as arrived-at insight rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing wants. Embodied emotion is present in "reed-blown melancholy" but remains a static descriptor rather than evolving through contradictory feelings.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's occupation and gift are established, but her interior remains abstract—"whisper to ghosts" and analyzing dreams are told abilities without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final paragraph gestures toward renunciation ("see you soon") but no prior choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the director's investigation happens off-page, so agency is displaced. Motivation is stated ("salvage something pure") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Diagnostic self-awareness ("they leave echoes," "weaves truth carefully") flattens interiority into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and present throughout, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization is delivered as summary exposition ("she realized then") without dramatized micro-choices showing the shift. Her action—following fireflies—demonstrates agency, but the internal arc feels more like stated appreciation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's professional skepticism is established early and her sharply observant nature drives the letter reconstruction, but her interiority reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from debunker to truth-excavator is declared rather than earned through on-page tension between competing impulses. Her final stance arrives via exposition ("she now understood") instead of a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece tells us she's changed without showing the moment of renunciation or decision that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority contains contradictory impulses (old astronomers vs. Maren's movement, shadow vs. light), and his final descent shows renunciation with cost—leaving the observatory after decades. However, the protagonist's key choice at the climax (altering radio frequencies) feels passive and cerebral rather than embodied under pressure; the decision moment lacks visceral contradiction or micro-choices that let us feel the war in his heart. Motivations are stated more than dramatized through agonized micro-choices ("His allegiance had finally settled" tells rather than shows the tipping point). The internal conflict is rich conceptually but underperformed at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's initial characterization is vivid (calloused fingers, vagrant penny poet), but his transformation occurs too suddenly—the music box shifts him from observer to "translator between generations" via declared epiphany rather than earned contradiction. The final paragraphs stack emotional labels ("gleaned redemption," "lonesome splendor") rather than embodying them through micro-choices. Internal conflict is thin; his doubt or struggle never complicates the preservationist calling once he finds the music box.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    The engineer remains an abstraction delivering orchestrated interiority rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. "Logically emotional state—the mind's precise calculations harmonizing with the heart's unyielding resolve" is diagnostic label-speak that names rather than embodies the trait. No genuine internal conflict emerges; he executes a plan without friction, cost, or mistake. The final stance feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The "wildness that roiled beneath her skin" and "restrained wildness" are label-only traits without embodied contradiction acting in scene. Her final alignment feels abstract and unearned—no visible internal conflict between impatience and patience forces a difficult choice with felt cost. The ending's shift "from impatience...into endurance" is told as smooth transformation rather than shown as struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared but rarely tested through embodied choice under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("watchful calm was a mask," "fortified vulnerability") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father backstory surfaces as exposition rather than friction that alters a present micro-choice. The final "smile, the first genuine one in years" reads as an unearned epiphany, not a renunciation or endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (the deliberate handling of components), but his interior life remains somewhat abstract. The key choice—whether to trust Anja and proceed—lacks genuine contradiction; he never wavers or doubts. The final stance (guardian of beauty) feels declarative rather than earned through visible cost in the moment. Anja functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    Zephyr's "yearning algorithm" functions as a label rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The cart glider's interiority relies heavily on abstract machinery metaphors ("internal yearning algorithm," "steadily curious energy") rather than embodied choice under pressure. The pivotal decision to pursue the Silent Bell emerges from stated desire without visible internal conflict or trade-off—no path is foreclosed with felt cost. The overseer appears briefly but applies no relational pressure that forces Zephyr to alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—he's obsessed with the cold case—but his characterization remains predominantly observational and analytical without embodied contradiction. The final choice to broadcast the file is significant but arrives swiftly without visible internal conflict or cost; the shift from "keeper of memory" to "avenger" is told rather than shown through competing impulses. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("gnawed at him," "haunted by") and the climax lacks the micro-hesitations or bodily resistance that would ground the stakes in felt experience. The piece needed at least one on-page moment where professional duty and revolutionary impulse collide in a dramatized micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    Shael's interior life is largely told through abstract labels ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The core choice—reconstituting the crystal—unfolds through procedural description of method rather than a struggle between competing impulses with visible cost. The shadow-laced fingers and empathy-mapping rhetoric remain decorative rather than constraining tactical decisions. Motivation is declared but never tested by a moment where desire conflicts with fear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arthur's motivation is clear and philosophically coherent—seeking the sound of endings rather than silence—but his interior life relies heavily on abstract formulations ("fold in patience," "cumulative texture of a thousand small surrenders") that label rather than embody contradiction under pressure. The parasol tip functions as an anchoring object, yet his engagement with it remains observational; no on-page micro-choice visibly alters his stance until the final realization, which arrives as epiphany rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The other volunteers are sketched but apply no relational pressure; Arthur remains a solitary observer whose change feels more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    The sentinel lacks genuine interiority or agency—it observes and arranges but never confronts a choice with cost. Lila and Marc receive minimal characterization beyond their spatial positioning; their reconciliation feels unmotivated because we never see what they lost or why they turned away. The sentinel's motivation "to nurture intersubjective understanding" reads as prompt-label therapy-speak rather than embodied desire. No contradictory impulses act in scene; the sentinel executes its mission without friction or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The line walker's motivation is stated clearly but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His "strangely honest nature" is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice with visible cost. The consecration actions proceed smoothly without genuine resistance, misbelief, or complication—he kneels, traces symbols, succeeds, then does it again. The mask is left behind in the final line, but this renunciation arrives unearned by prior hesitation or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is stated but never tested through meaningful choice under pressure; he selects photos and layers them, but these actions encounter no resistance or cost that would reveal character depth. The "staggered back" moment at the climax reads as reactive awe rather than an earned decision that forecloses a path. Interior language leans on stock phrases ("heart thrumming a rhythm," "moth in a jar") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("collective healing," "transmute pain") without embodied contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scholar's motivation is established early (decode the pattern of growth) and embodied through his interaction with the crystal. His reticence is claimed but not dramatized through genuine internal contradiction—he moves smoothly from hypothesis to experiment to understanding without visible cost or struggle. The "weathered innocence" feels label-only; his choices flow linearly without the friction of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final acceptance of his role as "final witness" lands as epiphany rather than earned renunciation with foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's "precognitively forgetful" trait is established early and shapes his reliance on the chalk, but the contradiction never constrains a concrete choice with visible cost—he moves through the ritual without meaningful internal conflict between competing impulses. The motivation ("capture the sound of growing older") remains abstract; we see him arranging objects and drawing, but no micro-choice reveals what he's sacrificing or risking in this moment. Embodied emotion is present ("shaking hand," "shallow, expectant bursts"), yet the interiority leans toward poetic summary ("tidal longing," "a ghost flitting at the edge of his vision") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final act of drawing feels more ritual completion than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's profession as camera repairer remains ornamental—he never repairs cameras on-page, and the skill transfers zero expertise to clock work or orbital mechanics. His sudden leap from "methodical" tinkerer to astrophysics savant who can "redirect frantic energy" into "controlled thrust" lacks embodied struggle or visible cost. The leaf-timing method arrives as mystical fiat rather than earned insight from his craft. Interiority cycles through stock metaphors ("luminous ache," "bitter echo") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elijah's "decisively kind nature" and "serene" demeanor are label-only; no internal contradiction or embodied emotion surfaces. The motivation to "execute a flawless goodbye" is stated but never tested by a competing impulse or mistake. Mr. Hale's softening is told rather than dramatized through contradictory action. The final choice—playing and symbolically reunifying the record—feels unmotivated by prior causality; Elijah simply does what the scene requires without visible cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives her actions throughout, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"her resolve quietly deliberate" reads as a label rather than embodied contradiction. The shadow entity confrontation offers a moment of genuine pressure ("heart hammered, but her hands remained steady"), yet the closing choice feels inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict. The "quietly deliberate" trait appears as repetition without constraining a choice where hesitation would carry cost. Emotional progression is mostly linear; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's professional skepticism combined with openness to the impossible reads coherently, and her final choice to surrender the tooth carries visible cost (losing her anchor to the Fae world). However, the decision feels inevitable rather than conflicted—no competing impulse acts against it in the moment. The child's abstract pronouncements ("I'm what remains when the exchange is incomplete") replace embodied stakes with exposition, and Eleanor's interior remains descriptive rather than contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara exists primarily as a vehicle for ornamental description rather than contradiction or agency. Her "promise to the sky itself" and orphaned backstory arrive as summary labels without on-page friction or cost-bearing micro-choices. Interior states remain smoothly poetic throughout, with no credible irrationality or flawed impulse that complicates her polishing task. The motivation to "share light without using fire" faces no dramatized obstacle or trade-off—she simply executes a method she has already mastered.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's internal life receives sustained attention through the amber pendant and her response to public exposure, but her choices remain reactive rather than driving pressure. The meeting with Maya feels arranged rather than earned through Elara's agency; their shared trauma creates instant understanding without friction or cost. Interiority occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("grafting new meaning onto old wounds") that flattens emotional complexity. The final "watchful dreamer" stance crystallizes but doesn't foreclose a visible path with felt cost—both characters simply agree to share the sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The novelist's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("lucidly watchful," "sacred space") rather than embodied contradiction. The collecting action shows some purpose-driven movement, but the ephemeral characters function as props without applying genuine relational pressure. The final shift from "conflicted" to resolved reads as asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Therapy-speak phrases ("solemnize this moment of your becoming") and diagnostic self-awareness flatten what should be crisis-state perception.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias exhibits consistent motivation (restore sacred practices) and his actions align with his tinkerer identity, but interiority remains thin—mechanical adjustments and whispered commands do not reveal contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The cricket's success feels too smooth; no dramatized obstacle tests his commitment or forces a choice with visible cost. Tears at the end assert emotion rather than earning it through conflicted micro-choices under pressure. The vine tendril's silent confirmation and the arbor's personified listening flatten agency into ambient magic rather than character-driven stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen demonstrates embodied patience through the tweezers-and-frequency work, but interiority remains largely expository rather than contradictory or viscerally felt. The motivation to "translate heartbeats into maps" is told through inheritance and family history, not dramatized through an on-page micro-choice that reveals cost. Emotional states are labeled ("weathered," "steady") without embodied tension, and the seventeen-year backstory flattens present urgency. No decision-point forces Kaelen to weigh competing goods or suffer visible loss; the ritual proceeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and stated early, but his characterization relies heavily on summary and abstract description ("peripherally focused attention," "working like the locks he designed") rather than concrete embodied action. The weeks of work are compressed into exposition rather than dramatized choices under pressure. His final decision to preserve the crystal feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible internal conflict; there's no moment where he weighs competing goods or faces a meaningful cost that alters his options.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to collect emotional burdens is declared but never tested through on-page choice or contradiction. The calcification process unfolds as predetermined ritual rather than decision under pressure; no competing impulse or visible cost shapes her agency. Interiority remains abstract ("fractal-weaving senses," "dimensional angles") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The transformation earns a static vessel state rather than alteration through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is established through concrete action (carving) and embodied grief responses, with the calloused hands detail anchoring her transformation. The motivation to carve while processing loss feels genuine, and micro-choices (lifting tools, tracing the mane) reveal hierarchy of values. However, interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("to re-member, to physically gather what scattered in shock") that reads more conceptual than character-particular. The final renunciation—accepting that love "transforms but does not end"—feels somewhat delivered rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias remains more conceptual vessel than embodied character. His internal state is told through abstract labels—"chronologically confused time twisted his memories," "regret was a weight"—rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The micro-choices (kneeling, reciting borrowed memories, walking) lack visible cost or genuine resistance; he moves through symbolic stations without friction. The ghost functions as floating metaphor rather than pressure that forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's internal life consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical framing ("functionally creative nature," "stoic wonder," "equations for hope") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The sextant piece and water system provide tactile anchors, but her decisions—turning a valve, tracing lines—never reveal competing impulses or a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending gesture (slipping the sextant into her pocket) reads as symbolic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. Diagnostic label-speak ("curious civil engineer mind," "functionally creative") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("stoic wonder") flatten interiority at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's interiority relies heavily on summary and abstract labels ("buried longing," "old friend") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The key choice—humming a single note—arrives without prior embodied resistance or cost that would make the shift credible. Emotion is asserted through phrases like "heart fuller" and "make peace with" instead of shown through incompatible wants acting simultaneously. The final reconciliation reads as declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through embodied action: trailing his hand in water, feeling tremors in current, working against mud's grip. Internal contradiction appears in "craved the clarity" versus the death-like cost of releasing his life's work. The shift from treasure hunter to truth-seeker is earned through months of preparation and the final discovery, though the closing epiphany ("pursued the wrong ending to the correct story") edges toward articulated insight rather than purely dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve ancient methods is established, but his agency remains passive throughout—he observes, kneels, traces, watches. The weaver grants him access without any meaningful choice or trade-off on his part. "Infinite patience" and "philosophical seed collector" function as labels rather than embodied traits that constrain decisions. The final handing-back of the fulgurite carries no visible cost or alteration; Elias simply turns to leave with meanings "etched into his mind like scars," a claim rather than a dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is coherent (writing obituaries, understanding healing) but his agency never faces meaningful resistance or internal contradiction. The gardener remains a distant subject rather than a second character creating pressure; Elias observes and reflects without a single choice that forecloses an option or incurs visible cost. Interiority leans toward therapy-speak ("geography of healing," "integration") and the final act—writing the obituary—simply executes his established trade without struggle or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and stated early, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract reverie ("quaking reverie," "painfully sweet") rather than embodied contradiction. The prince makes a single large choice at the end—cracking the egg—without visible micro-choices that test competing impulses under pressure. His final tears feel labeled rather than earned through scene-specific bodily cost. No secondary character appears to apply immediate relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled early and her firefighter/arsonist's daughter duality is clear, but her arc is more declared than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The planting action feels symbolic rather than choice-driven under pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from the sapling decision itself. Interiority leans toward therapy-speak ("scars could sing," "unyielding compassion grafted onto the world") rather than embodied contradiction. The final walk away lacks a genuine alteration or renunciation that would register as earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael is labeled "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" but these traits never constrain a choice or create internal conflict on the page. His motivation (liberating memories) drives movement through the city, but there's no embodied struggle, no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he simply follows breadcrumbs until the box opens. The grandmother memory arrives late as exposition rather than earned discovery, and the final "smile" resolves complexity into tidy satisfaction without visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("sharp ache of loss," "hope rising in his chest") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    The sentimentalist's motivations are stated abstractly ("to share light without using fire") but never crystallize into a concrete, embodied choice under pressure. Interiority consists largely of passive observation and summarized emotion ("its heart ached," "felt both joy and loss") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile is asserted without grounding in prior causality; we're told the character has fulfilled its purpose, but no on-page micro-choice demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and philosophically anchored, with embodied emotion in his carving and sensory engagement with the greenhouse. However, his search for "the shape of collective grief" remains abstract—no on-page micro-choice tests competing impulses or costs until the final carving decision, which arrives without dramatic friction. The spectral mentorship functions more as atmospheric permission than as a source of internal contradiction or stakes. Grandfather's "presence measured in the rustle of leaves" reads poetic but does not dramatize a choice between competing values or impose visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and consistent, driven by shame and the pursuit of incremental absolution. His motivation remains coherent throughout, and the carved inscriptions embody his ritualistic penance. However, the emotional arc lacks embodied contradiction—his guilt proceeds smoothly toward peace without on-page friction or a moment where conflicting impulses act simultaneously. The final shift to "quiet, enduring peace" feels asserted rather than earned through a visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows consistent motivation (discovering the shape of intentions), but his interior life remains thin—label-only traits ("blithe nature") and diagnostic phrasing ("stubborn resistance," "seeking forgiveness") replace embodied contradiction. The core action (untangling Foster's thread) feels enacted without genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is tidy rather than irrational; Elias completes his task with "familiar warmth" but no struggle that tests commitment or reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    The cartographer's motivation is asserted rather than embodied—he "burns clear" to "seed innovation within a constraint," but this reads as thematic declaration rather than lived desire under pressure. Interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("ignorance now a map," "quiet confidence") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final descent feels like a victory lap rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; he simply walks away lighter, his work complete, with no embodied struggle or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation and reawakening—but his internal life remains generic. The progression from copyist to conductor lacks contradictory impulses; he simply succeeds at each step without meaningful hesitation or cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart pounded" and closing eyes are the sole physical markers in a story dense with abstraction. The final smile and completed work read as unearned satisfaction rather than a choice weighted by genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—to crystallize a fleeting emotion—is clear and sustained, and his trade as a "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" provides a particular lens. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("the quiet ache of missing," "brittle and beautiful") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to powder the mask feels more ritualistic than dramatically earned by prior micro-decisions with visible cost. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("acceptance of fragility") in the resolution lowers the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.2)
    Sebastian's philosopher identity is declared through epigrams and internal labels ("rationally rebellious," "philosophical duty") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The agonizing is told in summary ("Sebastian agonized nightly") with a Chinese-language dream sequence that feels ornamental rather than embodied. The final choice to emerge with the artifacts lacks visible cost—no on-page trade-off or foreclosed path—making the endurance claim feel asserted rather than earned. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("epistemological diversity," "manufactured consent") that flattens embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor demonstrates clear motivation and her hierarchical values (music preservation over administrative approval) emerge through micro-choices. However, interiority remains abstract—"expectant resignation" and "weathered fingers" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The students' transformation lacks granular resistance or individual texture; they shift from "self-consciousness" to "unexpected unity" without dramatized friction. The final "we are all instruments" speech edges toward diagnostic clarity that no teacher would articulate mid-crisis, costing embodied authenticity at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's core trait (tasting memories) is vividly established but never drives an on-page choice under pressure; it remains atmospheric texture. Internal contradiction appears only in the "no room for bitterness" moment, which reads as self-instruction rather than simultaneous impulse conflict. The climactic fruit harvest floods her with memories, yet no micro-choice emerges—she follows a predetermined plan (divide and plant) without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The final image shows outcomes but no dramatized renunciation or trade-off that tests her values.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's involuntary truthfulness is established early and causes visible friction ("You look nervous…" / the merchant flees), but the trait doesn't complicate the tower ascent or final choice—he simply retrieves a poem and gives the box away without internal conflict between honesty and his goal. The lacquer box is labeled "the one secret he'd managed to keep," yet no on-page cost or contradiction follows; the claim floats unearned. The girl at the end receives wisdom passively; Elias's final smile reads as satisfaction rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present (clutching the box, kneeling) but the peak beats lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to document living houses is told rather than tested on-page. The orris-root encounter triggers immediate understanding without contradiction or struggle; no micro-choice forecloses a live option. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("auditory gold," "cosmic pressure") and diagnostic self-awareness that flattens rather than embodies experience under pressure. The final "knowing" reads as declarative summary rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "welcome nuance into shattered certainty" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The embodied detail is strong—stone hand worn smooth, telepathy threading through the crack—but the peak choice (setting the ampoule down, striking the chime) feels more like a thesis demonstration than an earned renunciation with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized ("his true trial began") rather than shown as simultaneous, competing drives. The "incisively kind" label does not constrain a choice where kindness costs him something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's "grim optimist" stance is declared more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The dice-clutching and equation-writing show goal pursuit, but interior texture relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("texture of a missed opportunity," "perpetual motion that traps souls") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final laugh and healed-dice moment gesture toward change, but the path from regret-loop to freedom reads more as thematic assertion than earned agency with visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is consistent and rooted in a specific obsession—proving strangers remember kindness—but the piece relies heavily on abstract motivation ("methodically hopeful spirit") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. Her micro-choices (settling cross-legged, dipping the brush) advance action but remain illustrative rather than revealing competing desires. The final smile and "quiet triumph" feel emotionally complete but lack the visible cost or foreclosed path that would ground the renunciation. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slips into declarative summary ("a feeling: the slight warmth").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is vivid and historically grounded, with embodied emotion in the kneading scene ("her knuckles white") and micro-choices that reflect her curatorial instinct. The communal ritual creates pressure, but the ending choice—baking an "L" for the lost fresco—feels more symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (grief vs. determination) but remains somewhat static across the arc. The cast is appropriately sized and choreographed, though secondary characters like Kaelen function mostly as prompt-givers rather than applying sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The clockmaker's motivation is established but remains abstract—the "neatly inventive mind" and "counter-clockwise" motif are labels rather than embodied traits that constrain choices. Internal conflict is minimal; he moves through the ritual without contradictory impulses or genuine hesitation. The dissolution ending forecloses agency rather than dramatizing a choice with visible cost, and the transformation reads as externally imposed rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation remains abstract throughout—"trick fear into revealing its weakness" is never grounded in a concrete want that shapes moment-to-moment choices. Interiority relies heavily on label-only feelings ("trembled," "screamed to look away") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The "unbosoming" climax arrives without prior dramatization of what specific truths are being withheld, making the transformation feel asserted rather than earned. The whispering advisor delivers exposition but never applies pressure that forces the protagonist into a genuine dilemma with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prophet's interiority is poetic but distant—we observe their ritual actions without internal contradiction or pressure-tested choices. Motivation ("to turn obstacles into instruments") is stated rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The transformation process lacks embodied struggle; the prophet performs flawlessly without visible cost or genuine friction between want and execution. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—connect with the watchers, understand her father's fate—and her obsessive focus is consistently shown through her work. However, her character operates largely in observation mode; her months of study are summarized rather than dramatized, and the final whistle-playing feels more like executing a discovered solution than a choice with visible internal conflict. The embodied emotion is present in moments like "trembling hands" but much of her drive is told through labels ("quietly driven," "obsessive focus") rather than enacted contradictory impulses in scene. The closure renunciation—accepting she cannot pass through but can maintain connection—carries weight, but the path there lacks a moment where competing desires clash on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is characterized primarily through labels: "emotionally rational," "historian," "prided himself." His internal contradiction is told ("tested even his composure") rather than shown through simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene. The grappling sequence offers physical action but no embodied emotional complexity—his "heart pounding but his mind clear" reads as a neat binary rather than layered irrationality. The station master's sudden appearance and capitulation lacks earned causality; his shift from lunging attacker to slumped acceptance happens in two lines without visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is articulated through consistent behaviors (placing notes, documenting), and his grandfather's history provides concrete anchoring. However, his "stoically sensitive demeanor" remains largely asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to leave notes and mark the map feels predetermined by his established role rather than a moment where competing desires act simultaneously. No meaningful internal conflict shapes the closure; he executes his routine without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's choice to form an alternative hypothesis drives the investigation, and his decisions to correlate dates and heat the stamp show agency under pressure. However, his interiority relies heavily on tell ("tranquilly perceptive nature," "feverish determination") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of readjusting entries feels like task completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible personal cost, weakening the character arc's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his nightly ritual of polishing quartz cranes, with genuine internal contradiction visible in "a beautiful madness born of love and loss." The interiority is concrete and character-specific—his grief as "measured, focused energy, fuel for his craft"—and his repeated acceptance of delusion ("he knew it was a delusion") while continuing the work demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The piece lacks a second on-page character to test relationship dynamics, but the solo focus allows strong embodied emotion and micro-choices (selecting each stone, applying polish, scoring with precision) that reveal his hierarchy of values. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's slight drift toward summary rather than remaining in embodied present action.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is heavily abstract and conceptual ("cartographer of what never was") rather than embodied and contradictory. The drone strike backstory is summarized, not dramatized, and his motives remain declarative ("bleak exhilaration") without showing internal conflict acting in scene. The final choice to "hunt" is asserted through preparation gestures, not earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Therapy-speak intrudes ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy") at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kai's interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("frequency of belonging," "resonance that suggested some universal language") rather than embodied contradiction. The perpetual surprise attribute is label-only; it never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. Motivation remains stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—Kai follows the mission smoothly without internal friction that would force a difficult micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and particular—the watch hand as tactile anchor, the ritualistic driftwood carvings—and his guilt is embodied rather than labeled. The internal contradiction between manufacturing false memories to avoid his own is compelling. However, the final choice to invite Mara to the shore feels insufficiently earned; the shift from years of paralysis to suddenly opening his method lacks a visible on-page trigger that would foreclose his prior isolation. Mara's motivation remains underexplored; she functions more as pressure vessel than as a character with contradictory drives of her own.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Julian's interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("transformation, not just transaction," "liminal space so thin it could only be measured in breaths") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The drawer pull functions as a touchstone but his engagement with it remains static—squeezing it repeatedly without evolving cost or tactical constraint. The final "untether" moment is asserted as a shift but not earned through on-page struggle; no live choice forecloses a competing option with visible price. Mellor and Roshni appear but apply minimal immediate pressure; the exchange proceeds without dramatized friction or risk that tests Julian's flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior state is richly drawn with embodied contradictions—the "merrily melancholic" facade versus the tremor in her hands, the pull toward water despite professional ruin. The apprentice's death and her responsibility are felt, not merely labeled. However, the final turn ("let one gravitate naturally toward the other") arrives through insight rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses a live path, muting the visible cost. The compass-pointing-toward-herself moment risks epiphany convenience, though the coastal draw and her ongoing attempts show credible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "kindle empathy" is stated but never enacted through concrete micro-choices under pressure. His interior remains abstract—"jaded wonder," "void where his memories once festered"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final submersion reads as passive surrender rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the "flicker of warmth" arrives by assertion, not dramatized struggle. The "clean slate seeker with dirty past" concept operates as a label rather than a lived contradiction shaping on-page decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to restore Shadowpaw is clear and sustained, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("paradoxically steady," "heart translating sounds") rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation sequence lacks micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; she proceeds through ritual steps without visible hesitation or trade-off. The "I don't want to become something else" line arrives too late and dissolves immediately without dramatized cost. Internal conflict is declared more than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer's grief and motivation are clear, but interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("hollowed her soul into a vessel") rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization about lost time transforming into "beauty that chokes" reads as an epiphany stated rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Agency is present in the unfastening ritual, but the protagonist's path from grief to acceptance lacks visible internal resistance or cost that would demonstrate genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's pacifist trait and her dedication to preservation are stated but never tested on-page; she confronts "fear, regret, doubt" via shadow work in summary rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her growing heaviness during stitching offers embodied emotion, but the final joy feels unearned—no visible cost forecloses a path (she "stayed" but this restraint arrives without prior temptation dramatized). The change lacks causal grounding in prior on-page struggle; interiority reads as label-heavy ("peculiar trait," "ghostly resolve") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is given abstract labels ("self-designated philanthropist," "orchestrates coincidences") rather than embodied traits shown through choice under pressure. His motivation to "understand the texture of transformation" remains declarative; the story tells us he seeks this but never dramatizes what internal conflict or contradictory impulse drives the quest. The climactic discovery—a box of petrified relics—arrives via passive following rather than an earned micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Emotional progression is missing: he laughs at the revelation without visible cost or renunciation that would make the change legible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's sentinel role is established but her interior life remains thin—she observes coded messages and makes decisions, yet emotional embodiment is largely absent. The final choice to join the revolution lacks earned contradiction; we never see her wrestle with conflicting loyalties in scene, only a summary statement that "loyalty lay with the commanders or with the truth." The bronze quill holder functions as a plot key but never constrains a micro-choice or reveals character under pressure. Secondary characters appear only at the end as exposition vehicles, applying no relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    The herder's interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("sacred patterns," "borrowed dawn") rather than embodied contradiction. Her precognitive curse remains a label that doesn't force dramatized mistakes or visible trade-offs in the climactic sequence. The final transformation floods her with understanding via passive reception rather than a choice between competing goods, and phrases like "born anew by borrowed dawn light" substitute lyrical gloss for earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    The poet's motivation ("to understand the cartography of scars") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The reflective interiority dominates without micro-choices that test his values under pressure; his decision to open the envelope lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. "Furiously tranquil" is named but never embodied in action or physiological detail. The final stance—descending as a cartographer—feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias and Lyra are introduced with vivid physical traits (the mechanical arm, sharp eyes), but their motivations remain largely asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure. The "duel" structure invites internal contradiction—each wants to "transform" rather than win—but this stance is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Elias's final smile and relaxed arm signal resolution, yet no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges; the endpoint reads as mutual satisfaction without struggle. Lyra's entrance and circling gestures add physicality, but her interior remains opaque, limiting relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's monthly personality molts are declared but never constrain a choice or force a visible tradeoff on the page. The relationship with Maya develops through shared activity, but interior contradiction remains thin—his helpfulness and literary passion feel consistent across the whole span rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final paragraph's transformation ("not into someone new, but into someone fuller") reads as therapeutic summary rather than an earned renunciation with dramatized cost. Motivations remain abstract ("beauty from anarchy") without micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    The pianist's motivation is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. His "steely longing" and wish to "surprise fate" remain abstract labels; we never see him hesitate, doubt, or pay a visible emotional price for manipulating time. The final peace feels unearned because no prior struggle or renunciation forecloses a path with cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "chest tight") without character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (protecting cultural memory) is clear and consistent, but his interior experience leans abstract—"luminous doubt" appears as a label more than embodied contradiction. The dream sequence offers symbolic gestures (woman weaving starlight, churning faces) without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final act (speaking "Unfinished" into the void) reads as a solved puzzle rather than a decision with visible internal cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kenji's motivation is clear and his interiority concrete through the bonsai work, but the emotional arc relies heavily on labeled feelings ("cerulean regret") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandmother's compass and lace provide external anchors, yet the pivotal moment—his acceptance of horizontal possibility over reaching toward Aiko—arrives through contemplation rather than a choice that forecloses a lived option with visible cost. The piece shows patience and measured grief but lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her background as a neutron star researcher, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as drawing the dust pattern for Mr. Gable.

No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; character feels specific and flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in his profession and personal history; his inadvertent stubbornness drives the plot and is embodied in his obsessive repair attempts. Interiority is concrete, such as his muttering "Impossible" at 3:17 AM, showing contradiction between weariness and determination. The final realization about his own lack of permanent rest is earned through his journey, with cost felt in the chasing stillness. Minor weakness: stubbornness is occasionally stated rather than fully shown, but it doesn't undermine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias and Lena exhibit concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, with Lena's shift from suspicion to purpose earned through dramatized actions. Contradictory impulses are shown in scene, such as Lena's fear mixed with curiosity. The final renunciation (bell's silence as mission fulfilled) is motivated by prior causality, with cost in the ongoing sanctions. Minor hairline slip: Elias's leadership verges on overly idealized, but flaws like initial stubbornness anchor credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His unique attribute of hearing colors and the goal to capture trust's sound drive credible actions, and the final imprint feels earned with visible cost, though minor hairline slips in emotional depth prevent a perfect score.

    Characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in yearning, not greed. Interiority is concrete, e.g., "trembling hands" and "chest ache with luminous disbelief." The final choice to leave the portrait is earned through the realization that it reflects his own longing, with visible cost in his lighter heart. Contradictory impulses act in scene when he hears silence but persists, leading to epiphany.

    Finn's motivation is clear and rooted in his contemplative nature, driving his decision to abandon the vase for the teardrop. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through actions like tracing the bookmark. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing the original project. However, minor over-articulation in self-narration slightly reduces immediacy.

His final choice to confront the betrayer is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his transformed view of vulnerability.

    Unit 734's motivation to find the origin of thoughts is clear and consistent, driving key choices like overriding the directive to play the violin. Interiority is concrete through robotic yet curious perception, and the final transformation to sentinel is earned with visible cost as consciousness fragments during amalgamation. The trait of being "remarkably composed" enables calm under pressure, but the robotic nature slightly limits emotional depth.

    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His internal conflict between low luck and persistent care is shown through actions like polishing marbles, and the final realization is earned by prior causality. The closure choice—recognizing the garden's reciprocity—forecloses his isolation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and personal, driving the experiment, with embodied emotion in his calloused hands and fascination. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped; his drive lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices under pressure, like lever pulls, reveal values, but the final subdued awakening feels earned yet slightly tidy. Dr. Chen applies secondary pressure, but her role is functional rather than deeply crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and earned change from skepticism to belief. The musician's interiority is concrete, and his decision to play the cello arises from prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority showing her insomnia and methodical hope.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a museum guide, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "felt each shift in the bedrock like a fracture in her own bones"). Her final choice to bake the initial for the fresco is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ritual. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her determination versus grief, under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in post-resuscitation trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's emotionally rational trait is consistently embodied, driving his composure under pressure and micro-choices like sidestepping the master. However, his interiority lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats, leaning toward steady rationality without credible irrationality, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.

Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with contradictory impulses (exhilaration vs. horror) acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's guilt is concretely embodied through rituals like tracing the watch hand and sifting driftwood, with contradictory impulses (can't stop manufacturing memories despite guilt) driving credible micro-choices. Mara's presence forces a decisive change, and his invitation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his cracked voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Julian's motivation is deeply rooted in past trauma, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as squeezing the drawer pull. His final untethering from failure is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. The trait of thoughtfulness constrains actions, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's interior contradiction is vividly embodied through trembling hands and a "merrily melancholic" facade, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., avoiding then using the compass) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation of earthly markers for celestial navigation is earned by prior causality, with the cost legible in her exhausted elation. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing undermines the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—letting go of the baseball—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as he submerges and feels a shift. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with internal conflict between reluctance and determination embodied in micro-choices like lighting the spices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and internal conflict shown through "willingly perplexed" choice. The final acceptance of transformed time is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the cracked saucer burden. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's pacifism and emotional gravity trait are consistently embodied, driving her choices; her final renunciation to not step through the portal is earned with visible cost. However, some emotions like "joy touched her heart" lean slightly abstract, and internal conflict during shadow work could be more dramatized with contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with micro-choices under pressure, such as following the escaped lightning bug. His interiority is concrete, though the stated ability to "orchestrate coincidences" feels slightly tell-y rather than fully dramatized. The final realization of transformation is earned with visible cost in his gained understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of being calmly inventive, driving key choices like investigating the sundial and joining the revolution. However, internal conflict between loyalty and truth is summarized rather than deeply dramatized with contradictory impulses, slightly reducing emotional depth. The final decision is earned by prior causality but lacks a strongly felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The herder's precognitive curse and isolation drive her actions, and her final realization is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting his mechanical arm while waiting. His diplomatic fierceness is shown through dialogue and action, and the final understanding with Lyra is earned through their duel. Lyra's sharp presence adds relational pressure, reinforcing motives.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's characterization is vivid with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as revealing the coffee tin's secrets. His personality molting is integrated into his actions and relationships, particularly with Maya, forcing choices that alter the library's state. Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes decisions like organizing the resistance. Minor weakness: the molting trait occasionally feels abstract but is grounded in on-page costs.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    The pianist's wistfulness and strategic creativity are consistently embodied through micro-choices, such as lingering on the keys and devising the clock fix.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied doubt and micro-choices. His final shift from doubt to certainty is earned by the dream navigation, and the cost of nearly missing the monsoon is felt. However, the luminous doubt occasionally edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly reducing embodied impact in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kenji's motivation to find the color of unspoken apologies is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., "cerulean regret washing over him").

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear, specific, and grounded in her neutron star background; her gentleness and preference for slow repair feel earned. The interiority is vivid and character-particular (“not a god with a lightning bolt, but a gardener with a patient hand”). However, she is under relatively little on-page pressure, and we see few contradictory impulses or micro-choices where her values are genuinely tested. The neighbor exists more as an object of concern than as an active relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation—shifting from survival and fear toward finding “purpose in the pauses”—is clear and consistently embodied in his careful, deliberate actions. His interiority is specific (the smell of ghosts, the “strange new patience”) and particular to an artisan, though his emotional conflict is more linear than contradictory. The final decision to embed soot in his glass feels earned by the earlier traits and discoveries, with a credible sense of cost and resolve. What’s missing, slightly, is a sharper on-page clash of impulses (self-protective withdrawal vs. investigative drive) under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Her drive to reclaim sound and her embodied grief/hope are vivid and consistent, with strong use of gesture and sensory deprivation to individualize her. However, internal conflict is relatively simple—she rarely seems genuinely torn or at risk of giving up—so her final triumph feels emotionally linear rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motivations are clear and consistent—professional duty, weariness, and “inadvertent stubbornness” driving him to risk his life and sanity to mend the lens. Interiority is specific enough to feel individual, especially in lines like his fixation on giving “rest a permanent address.” The internal realization about why spirits refuse to settle is earned by the ordeal, though the emotional contradiction (his own inability to rest vs. his service to the dead) could be pushed even harder on the page. Secondary on-page character pressure is minimal (Mrs. Hargrove is mostly off-stage until the end), keeping this largely a solo interior crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias and Lena are cleanly motivated—quiet survival via trust, and a suspicious girl gradually won over by action—and their choices (designing the runs, agreeing to deliver, eventually taking over) all align with those motives. Interiority is understated but specific: the line about Lena’s “sharp suspicion” and growing curiosity, and Elias choosing “amplified quiet” over rebellion, feel character-particular. Internal contradiction is present but mild (Lena’s resentment vs. her compulsion to linger by doors), so the arc lands more as steady clarification than wrenching conflict. The endurance/renunciation at the end (Elias ceding active leadership; both accepting anonymity) is credible, though not presented with much felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and textured—the mix of rational artist and tentative mystic feels credible, and his motives (spiritual curiosity, “pilgrim of sparks”) are clear and consistent. However, the internal conflict between skepticism and belief is mostly stated rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. His final acceptance of “learning to see between worlds” is earned but low-cost. The lack of another on-page character means his values are never truly tested in relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to understand time and his wife’s disintegration) is clear and consistent, and his final renunciation feels earned by the prior setup. His interiority is specific enough to feel personal, though often summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. The grief/attachment vs. release conflict is implied more than actively fought through concrete micro-choices. Strong, but not yet at the depth or messiness of top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—saving the seed vault at the cost of his own life—is clear and consistent, and his competence under pressure feels earned. The chained body, raw wrists, and controlled panic give him some embodiment, and his use of the chains as tools is a strong character beat. However, his interiority is relatively one-note (grim, selfless resolve) with little contradictory impulse beyond a brief flare of panic, so we lack a deeper, more idiosyncratic sense of him. The final acceptance of death is credible but emotionally under-complex for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to recapture the sound of trust breaking—is clear, specific, and tied to his history with his sister, and his choices (coming to the greenhouse, imprinting the sound, deciding to send it out into the world) all align with that drive. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, especially in his synesthetic perceptions. However, internal contradiction and live conflict are muted; he rarely wavers or struggles against himself in the moment, which flattens complexity a bit. The final stance feels more like fulfillment of a long-held project than a hard-earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thief’s motivation—stealing “illuminated moments” to get closer to destiny—is clear, specific, and drives every choice. His emotional arc from confident operator to shaken seeker to newly oriented wanderer is credible and tied to concrete beats (silence at the canvas, the woman’s eye-smile, his decision to leave the portrait). Interiority is particular rather than generic, though the realization borders on tidy clarity. The cost of change (relinquishing the fantasy of stolen destinies) is present but could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Finn reads as a specific, offbeat mind—his ritualistic narration, attachment to the bookmark, and care for "safe zones for inquiry" all align cleanly. His decisive abandonment of the vase for the teardrop is motivated and coherent, though the internal conflict around that pivot is more stated than fully dramatized. Emotion tends to be conceptualized rather than embodied, which slightly flattens the sense of contradiction under pressure. Still, we get a credible mini-arc from intention to revised, more truthful purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s fear/adaptability conflict is clear and embodied (claustrophobia in the rusted library vs. determination to decode the cast), and his need to reclaim a stolen identity motivates each beat. However, his inner life leans on generalized abstractions (“vulnerability is power,” “transformative betrayal”) rather than concrete, character-specific perceptions. The stunt-double profession is barely dramatized and thus feels ornamental. The betrayer is thinly sketched, functioning more as a device than a person, which blunts the relationship-as-crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s interior is coherent and particular—his “mild obsession” set against his predecessor’s madness gives him texture and a credible caution. His motivation (to complete the map before the last star dies) is clear and guides his choices. However, internal contradiction under pressure is only lightly dramatized; he never really wavers or fails, so the final readiness costs him little on the page. The result is strong but not yet deeply fraught characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    734’s motivation is clear and consistent (to understand consciousness and resolve the temporal mess), and its micro-choice to override the second chance directive is well-motivated. However, interior conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied—its “curiosity” and composure are stated more than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from janitor to “sentinel of time” lands, but the emotional cost of that shift is only lightly sketched. This keeps the character interesting but short of truly deep or idiosyncratic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The registrar is clearly sketched—a solitary, observant figure whose choice to break silence and offer tea marks a modest but legible change. His interiority remains somewhat generalized, with little contradiction or sharp specificity under pressure. The two other figures function more as symbols of mistrust and reconciliation than as individuated people, so the relational crucible never fully heats. The final sense of no-longer-being-alone is earned but emotionally low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and convincing: his low luck score, stubborn care for the vines, and marble ritual all cohere into a distinct psyche. Motivation is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction under pressure is mild—this is more quiet endurance than a fraught choice. His emotional response to the final revelation is a bit summarized rather than richly embodied, which slightly softens the impact of his change. The endurance/recognition arc is earned but could show more visible cost or conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent (prove sideways time), and his competence as a “sky mechanic” is nicely embodied in the ritual of the levers and gauges. However, his interiority stays fairly flat—there’s little contradiction or genuine doubt under pressure, so the final “small smile” feels earned but low-stakes. Dr. Chen functions more as a validating witness than as a source of pressure or relational conflict. The piece lands an arc of confirmation rather than a felt transformation or costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    The musician’s drive to decode and honor Isabella is clear and consistent, and his professional identity as principal cellist feels specific. However, his emotional life is relatively flat: he shifts from skepticism to belief with little resistance and almost no contradictory impulses on the page. The absence of real fear or panic about the flood weakens the sense of a genuine internal crucible. His final stance is credible but not deeply earned through layered inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s inner life is specific and textured—her weakness after fever, tactile engagement with the illustration, and evolving grasp of her brother’s erasure all feel grounded. Motivation is clear (to locate and define the “weight” of truth) and her actions (smudging, repositioning the drawing) align with that. Internal conflict is present but mostly one-directional grief and dawning clarity rather than dynamically contradictory impulses on the page. The final acceptance/naming of the burden is earned but could be sharpened by a more explicit tug-of-war between wanting to know and fearing the knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s combination of “religiously skeptical” rationalism and quasi-mystical cassette ritual is an interesting, specific contradiction, and his guilt-driven exploration feels motivated. His micro-choices—continuing into the tunnel, deciding to treat the wheel as his valve, turning it—track cleanly with that inner burden. However, the internal conflict between skepticism and reliance on psychic tapes is noted more than dramatized; he never truly struggles on the page with whether to believe. The final release of guilt feels slightly quick and untested by any real doubt or counter-impulse in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The keeper’s core motivation—“to observe change without judgment”—is clear and consistently expressed, and the figure is distinct as a solitary, quasi-mythic archivist. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotion are minimal; they rarely feel under genuine pressure, and their reality-looseness remains more a stated trait than a dramatized struggle. The key “choice” to seek respite at the refuge and then return to record “one more entry” reads more like routine than a high-stakes decision. As a result, the character is intriguing but not yet fully alive or tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s characterization is specific and coherent: the music therapist whose “cautious exuberance” and ritual with the locket clearly govern her choices, and Leo’s guardedness and slow thaw feel credible for the length. Her professional identity shows up in action (choice of instruments, not forcing contact) rather than pure label. Internal contradiction is modest but present—hope vs. wariness, healer vs. one who knows she can’t “fix” people. Emotional texture occasionally edges toward generalized sentiment (e.g., “pure potential”) rather than fully embodied conflict, which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s motivation as the “Last Human Archivist” driven to preserve dream-resonance is clear and coherent, and her specialized way of perceiving the world is particular rather than generic. However, her internal conflict is muted: she notes the “risks” of probing the diaries, but we don’t feel her torn between two live options in a charged way. The emotional cost of her work (isolation, possible futility, self-endangerment) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in concrete reactions or bodily responses. The closing stance shift—understanding the axis as metaphysical and sensing dragons’ return—feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is clearly defined—a cryptic, ethically ambivalent ex-spy who now manipulates information through fortunes—and his professional habits feel specific. However, he experiences almost no genuine internal conflict; he’s calm, competent, and largely untested. Emotions are more conceptual than embodied, and his “satisfaction” at the end comes cheaply. The lack of visible doubt or competing impulses undercuts depth at this ambition level.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The priest’s motivation and method are clear and specific, and his brief moment of wavering under the entity’s pressure gives him some dimensionality. However, interiority is mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized, so we don’t feel a complex web of conflicting impulses. His emotional journey reads as focused more on function than on textured, contradictory humanity. The endurance at the end is credible but not heavily costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ai’s motivation is vivid, specific, and consistently dramatized—“conductor of unheard symphonies” is a coherent throughline from first paragraph to last. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic, rooted in sensory triggers (cracks, icicles, flaws in the glass) rather than abstract labels. Internal conflict is quieter: he’s driven but not really divided, so we don’t see much in-scene contradiction beyond the awareness of coming exhaustion. The closing endurance—accepting his return to fortune-cookie work while having touched “a place beyond time”—reads as an earned stasis with a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s drive (“determined to conquer” the labyrinth) is consistent and his final loss of power/eternity is a real cost, but his psychology is abstract—more function than person. Interiority leans on generalized formulations (“he wasn’t sure he was ready,” “he had been here before, but this time, something felt different”) rather than particular fears or contradictions. The absence of concrete, idiosyncratic detail or embodied emotion keeps him from reading as fully human, especially for a story hinging on the “self.”

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is sharply defined and embodied in concrete, tactile actions (filing the needle, pressing her palm to the record), and her deafness is integrated into how she perceives the scene. The desperation to feel again is vivid, though her inner life leans toward a single dominant drive rather than a more layered web of contradictory impulses. The final shift—“the filament of hush inside her…snapped”—is credibly earned by the build-up of choices and sensory strain. A touch more conflict between fear of further loss and hunger for sensation could deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—meticulous, cautious, and genuinely compelled by storms and patterns—so his interest in the tube and his final decision feel motivated. The internal tension between “nurturing integrity in solitude” and responding to the rogue invitation is articulated. However, the story leans on label-y summaries (“credibly curious nature,” “integrity he nurtured in solitude”) rather than fully dramatizing contradictory impulses under real-time pressure. The final “he made his choice” lands, but the specific emotional cost of that choice is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand why certain scents unravel him—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to his profession and history. His interiority is specific (“aromatically cautious,” ambushed by the past via smells) and embodied through small choices with the tools. However, his internal conflict runs mostly in one direction; we don’t see much active push-pull between wanting the truth and fearing it in the moment, only a stated fear of the flower’s story. The final shift—from confused grief to clarified sorrow—is earned but could feel deeper if more contradictory impulses surfaced under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Langdon’s characterization as an “ethically playful” roadside poet with a tactile, almost religious relationship to objects and patterns is vivid and consistent, and his motivation to understand time’s texture clearly drives the story. His internal conflict—torn between knowledge-with-suffering and ignorance-with-betrayal—is articulated, but it’s held more at a conceptual than embodied level. We get rich worldview and metaphor but relatively little concrete emotional or bodily response in the climactic chamber. The final move (refusing the binary and braiding the rope) is motivated by his nature, yet the personal cost of that stance isn’t fully felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motivation—to transform an unbearable, purposeless hush into something alive—is clear and consistently rooted in her sensory and familial history. Interiority is specific (the hush as “a tone without harmony,” the tear that is “not sad”) and her progression from searching to speaking/playing reads earned. However, internal contradiction remains relatively gentle; she moves from grief to acceptance without much on-page resistance or messy ambivalence. The final stance (becoming the next note) is credible but could carry more visible cost or conflicting impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dealer’s interiority is specific and textured, with a clear professional ethos rubbing against an emerging, unwanted empathy. Motivation (to turn others’ pain into product) is consistent and credibly disrupted when the chemist’s determination surfaces. The final renunciation—choosing to amplify hope rather than distill grief—feels earned by prior beats, though the emotional pivot is a touch tidy. Embodied detail (“a familiar weight…in their own chest”) grounds the feelings well.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marla is clearly motivated by a consistent, specific value set (noticing and uplifting invisible contributors), and her professional background adds a grounded texture to that generosity. However, she borders on idealized: we get minimal contradiction or genuine flaw on the page, so she reads more as an emblem than a fully pressured human. Her “cautious exuberance” is told more than dramatized in moments of conflict or hesitation. The relationship with Frederick is warmly sketched but largely summarized rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s longing for community is clear and motivates both the search and the all-night sculpting, and Elara’s function as an anchor/guide is coherent. However, internal contradiction is muted—Kael rarely seems genuinely torn, just lonely then fulfilled. Elara’s “bold sympathy” never costs her anything or produces friction, which keeps the relationship dynamics somewhat safe. The final sense of belonging feels earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—rebellious preservation against inevitable erasure—is clear and consistent, and his final choice to sever the cadence grows logically from that drive. His interiority is vivid in places (the pendant as reminder of his loop, the desperation as the cadence falters), but his conflicting impulses at the end (self-preservation vs. freeing the echoes) could be more fully dramatized rather than compressed into a single sentence of dilemma. Emotional states are mostly embodied through interaction with tools and setting, which works well. The endurance/sacrifice at closure feels earned, but the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—using magical “mathematics of emotion” to process his sister’s disappearance—is vivid, consistent, and grounded in specific ritual behavior. His interiority is concrete enough (the chipped patterns as variables, the way he handles the eyes) to feel particular rather than generic grief. However, internal conflict remains relatively tidy: his shift from seeking explanation to accepting ambiguity feels earned but not deeply contested on the page, with little sense of simultaneous contradictory impulses. The closing acceptance borders on a clean epiphany, softening the sense of ongoing flaw or unresolved friction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a gentle, meticulous recluse with a coherent backstory and consistent behavior, and his quiet longing to connect via artifacts feels specific rather than generic. His motivation is clearly rooted in childhood experiences with his father and the archives. However, he faces almost no internal contradiction or live moral tension in-scene; his choices are all comfortably aligned with his self-conception. The absence of visible cost for his hermit-like existence limits the depth of his characterization at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsessive, quasi-monastic devotion to plants is specific and convincing, and his shift from clinical observer to embodied participant is clearly motivated. The conflict between his desire for control and his emerging empathy is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (the data logging, the failed plastic shield, then dropping the tablet). His “reluctant metamorphosis” at the end feels earned, though the psychological cost of abandoning his old framework could be shaded with a touch more ambivalence. Overall, he reads as a distinct, coherent individual under pressure.

    Elara is sharply rendered—her insomnia, artistic compulsion, and choice to remain on the island all align cleanly and drive her actions toward the convergence and the exchange. Her interiority feels particular (the way she reads rain trails, treats insomnia as a tool) rather than generic, and her final revaluation of insomnia is earned by the pattern of behavior we’ve seen. However, her internal conflict (burden vs invitation, solitude vs connection) is mostly articulated rather than dramatized in concrete, pressured choices on the page. The stranger functions more as an archetypal counterpart than as a fully pressured character, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s clairvoyance, recent silence, and draw toward the cave give her a clear core, and the irony of a seer “walking blind” is effective. However, internal contradiction and real struggle are muted; she moves from uncertainty to cosmic fluency with little dramatized resistance. Her transformation feels more bestowed than hard-won, which softens the sense of cost. The pilgrim functions mostly as a confirming presence rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are clear and specific, and her choices (accepting the valve, designing staggered intervals, creating games for children) arise organically from them. However, she experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction; she reads as almost entirely competent and benevolent. The lack of a dramatized personal cost or moral tangle at the end keeps the characterization from feeling fully three-dimensional at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s goal and temperament are clear, and his choices (following the arrows, stepping onto the tracks, using the punch, then walking away from the fortress) track well with his meticulous, pattern-obsessed nature. However, his interior conflict stays fairly generalized—“dread and exhilaration,” “bad habits and new starts”—rather than dramatized through more idiosyncratic, concrete fears or blind spots. The hall of mirrors sequence hints at real self-confrontation, but the emotional cost remains abstract (we’re told he’s facing truths, not shown specific ones). The final stance shift feels coherent yet slightly tidy, lacking a sharply particularized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to ease the village’s grief despite her skepticism) is clear, consistent, and nicely rooted in “courageously kind” rather than in self-interest. Her transformation from skeptic to believer in intangible truths is legible and earned by the contact with the tile. However, her inner conflict is relatively tidy—there’s little genuine resistance or uglier flaw—and she assimilates the experience with minimal struggle. The emotional embodiment leans more on lyrical summary than on sharply particular, character-specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The immortal’s boredom and existential curiosity are clear and consistent, and his drive “to discover what happens after goodbye” credibly motivates a self-annihilating choice. Interiority has texture (“beige repetition,” “patience…worn to a translucence”) and the final surrender reads as paid-for rather than arbitrary. However, internal conflict is largely conceptual; we don’t see him meaningfully hesitate or waver in the moment, so contradictory impulses never fully spark against each other in-scene. The emotional register stays lofty and abstract, keeping us slightly distant from embodied feeling and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s motives—atonement for her father’s legacy and a rigorous sense of “fair trade”—are clear and drive her choices, and the ink’s backstory personalizes the magic nicely. However, her internal conflict is more asserted than dramatized; we’re told she’s “brutally honest” and burdened, but we rarely see her pulled between opposed impulses in-scene. Elena is functional and sympathetic but thinly drawn, mainly a receiver of help and praise. The final choice to give away the ink reads emotionally coherent but could land harder if we’d seen Maya tempted to hoard or exploit it earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.3)
    Silas’s motivation—to preserve or recreate textures of lost times—is clear and consistent, and his occupational detail feels specific. However, he’s rendered more as a beautifully described function than as a fully conflicted person; we see little internal contradiction or cost, especially once he’s said to feel “no loneliness.” The piece offers almost no genuine micro-choices under pressure, so his “arc” is essentially a static portrait of competency and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The man’s motivation and inner lens are vivid and specific—“a man made of stories” erased by bureaucracy is a strong, character-particular frame. His actions (kneeling, tracing, pocketing the label, recommitting to his role) align cleanly with that drive. What’s missing at an elite level is sharper on-page contradiction or internal conflict; he rarely feels pulled between competing impulses. The final stance feels more like an affirmation than a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has clear, specific motivation (a myth buster desperate to prove his own theory) and a distinct temperament (“gloomy cheerfulness”). His interiority around ridicule and doubt is present but lightly sketched; contradictory impulses (skeptic vs. seeker) could be more pressured in-scene. The shift from frustrated debunker to joyful questioner is legible and rooted in prior beats but emotionally low-cost. Overall he reads as individual and coherent, if somewhat idealized and unconflicted in his breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation and internal contradiction (preservation vs survival, documentarian vs organizer) are clear and consistent, and her pattern-seeing trait meaningfully informs her tactics. However, much of her struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in specific pressured moments, so we rarely see her make a hard, on-page choice with visible cost. Emotions are largely conveyed through thoughtful description and stance rather than embodied, conflicted reactions in a single live scene. The evolution of her “dual allegiance” into synthesis is convincing but lands more as thematic statement than as a felt, contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motivation (to capture the final “lunar morning”) is clear and consistent, and the heirloom grain provides a concrete emotional anchor. However, his interiority remains relatively smooth and unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses under pressure, just a steady melancholy resolve. The text tells us he must “outlast” cold and exhaustion, but we don’t really feel his body or mind starting to fail on the page. The ending endurance feels earned enough for this length, but emotionally under-dramatized for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’ competence, gentleness, and tactile “sight” are clear and consistent, and his motivation to restore the drone’s purpose is explicit. However, he faces almost no real resistance; his skills never fray and he never doubts, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict. The emotional palette is narrow (calm → satisfaction) with little embodiment beyond “calm in his chest.” The final state is essentially an untested confirmation of who he already was, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is cleanly sketched: an atlas editor with dry wit, scholarly obsession, and a calm competence that feels particular rather than generic. His motivation—to decode the phrasebook and find the rivers’ true origins—is consistent and plausibly built from his history with the mentor. However, he faces little explicit internal conflict or emotional cost on the page; he wants something and simply moves toward it. The final choice (to depart at dawn) is credible but not deeply tested or complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The tuner is more function than person: we get no interiority, no contradictory impulses, and no sense of cost or doubt, only an imperturbable ritual. Motivation is clear (“to rebuild what was lost…restoring shared balance”) but entirely unpressured and untested. His unreadable face and “infinitely patient” nature flatten emotional texture rather than individuating him. The town itself has more arc than the protagonist, which limits character-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marina’s motivation (mentor, research, and the lure of “ephemeral energies”) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to integrate with the temple is foreshadowed by repeated mentions of overriding instinct. However, her interior conflict is mostly summarized rather than embodied in specific, character-particular sensations or irrational impulses. The fear of the diving suit and the destabilization of her body are strong but brief, so the final self-annihilating decision feels more conceptually than emotionally hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation—to escape, expose the warden, and break his inherited reputation—is clear and consistently dramatized, and his choice to pursue escape instead of further warnings is well motivated. His interiority is specific enough to feel individual (e.g., reflecting on how lies can become truth) but rarely shows true contradictory impulses under pressure; he reads more as resolute than internally torn. Emotion is mostly carried via atmosphere rather than embodied reaction, which slightly flattens peak moments. The closing shift from “son of the boy who cried wolf” to an autonomous figure is earned but lands more intellectually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost bride’s motivation (“repay a debt across lifetimes”) is clear and consistent, and her paradoxical emotions are named effectively, though more told than dramatized. The botanist is thinner, largely a vessel for shivers, glimpses, and a single recovered memory rather than a fully individuated psyche. Their shared past is summarized competently but doesn’t quite yield present-tense contradictory impulses or real choice on the page. Still, their emotional connection at the climax feels legible and earned within the piece’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s sensibility as a weaver and her pull toward the emptied sea are clear, and her decision to sew in the ruins tracks with her established curiosity and craft. However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or genuine struggle—her motives are largely aligned and unopposed. The emotional texture is more atmospheric than psychologically specific, so her shift from disturbed witness to accepting agent of transformation lands as graceful but low-cost. The characterization is strong enough for the piece’s lyric aims but not yet piercing or fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore her faith in her lineage—is clear, specific, and consistently tied to her actions and perceptions, especially in how she treats the sundial base. Her interiority is concrete and individualized (“warmly curious” against “guarded cynicism”), and the final soft-turn toward renewed faith feels earned by what she experiences in the tomb. Internal conflict (cynicism vs. longing to believe) is present but could surface more sharply in a moment of doubt or hesitation before placing the base. The arc edges toward tidy in its closing articulation of her “life’s greatest work,” but it doesn’t feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elliot’s occupation, ritual, and worldview are clearly sketched, and his motivation—to mine “meaning in the margins”—is consistent throughout. However, he faces no real opposition, and we see almost no contradictory impulses or genuine pressure that would force a revealing choice. His emotions are largely told in generalized, reflective terms rather than embodied in specific, stressed reactions. The piece ends with him satisfied, but that endurance or stance isn’t earned through struggle; it simply reiterates the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias has a clear role and worldview—wise fool, listener to “unheard stories,” using craft as covert resistance—but his interior conflict is thin and mostly summarized. We rarely see contradictory impulses in action; he’s always serenely purposeful, so choices don’t feel pressured. His decision to complete the chart and “postpone” the coup is not shown as morally or emotionally costly, just inevitable. Strong concept of character, modest depth in motivation and felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    The medium’s motivation is clear and particular—she’s meticulously seeking the fork where love turned to regret—but she often feels more like a ritual instrument than a conflicted person. Interiority tends to be summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses; we’re told her purpose more than we see it cost her. Her micro-choices (where to walk, when to press the shard, when to move into moonlight) follow the ritual’s logic smoothly, with little struggle or ambivalence. The closing sense that she has been changed is asserted but not deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn: a weary, hyper-competent translator trying to “escape the weight” of his work but unable to stop decoding hurt, which feels specific and credible. His internal contradiction—wanting numbness yet leaning into the girl’s pain via the code—reads clearly in micro-choices. The girl is more emblematic than fully individuated, but her presence as a mirror works at this length. His final reframing of ache as “a map, a direction toward something like peace” is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent—rediscovering lost joy—and her artistic method feels integrated with her psychology. We get embodied emotion (her breath “like tiny ghosts,” the warmth of the fragment) and a clear internal stance toward risk and wonder. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper contradiction or moral friction; her desire is never seriously at odds with any competing impulse. The final satisfaction is earned but relatively straightforward, more acceptance than complex transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and responsiveness to the surreal are clear and particular, and her link between restoration and wonder is well-motivated. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she yields to the garden’s pull almost without resistance—so the “exchange of certainty for curiosity” lacks much on-page friction. The final change in how she sees the mural feels earned but lightly priced. The rogue is effectively sketched as an archetypal guide but doesn’t exert much personal pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Silas is vividly sketched—mischievous, principled, and performative—with clear motives tied to resisting the Thought Tax, and his choices (propose the plan, refuse to撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤撤

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s core drive—to turn pain into art—is clear and consistently dramatized through his insomnia, endless drafts, and ritual with the postcard. His emotional life is embodied in setting and objects more than in complex internal contradiction, so we get less sense of competing impulses in the peak moment than of a long, steady endurance. The shift from hoarding pain to accepting its dissolution feels earned by the centuries of labor sketched in. Still, his interior conflict stays relatively narrow, limiting the psychological depth you could reach at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The caretaker’s core motive (preserving forgotten names) is clear and credibly drives every choice, and the foxglove-regret hesitation over the fragile chime gives them a real flaw. Interiority is textured but often couched in abstract or symbolic language instead of concrete, character-specific memories, which slightly blunts the cost of sacrificing their own past. The progression from dutiful technician to someone visibly emptier and more alone by the end reads as an earned endurance rather than a revelation. A sharper glimpse of a specific lost memory would deepen both their individuality and the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation (restore trust and love) is clear and consistent, and her arc from paralysis to action is legible. However, her interiority relies on generalized reverence/urgency rather than sharply particular, contradictory impulses under pressure. The “carefully reckless” trait is stated and lightly echoed (“gamble,” “leap into the void”) but not tested against a serious on-page risk or genuine temptation to withdraw. The man’s characterization is essentially absent beyond a remembered laugh and a wordless arrival, so the relationship crucible is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The machinist’s motives (duty to the town vs. guilt and filial loyalty) are clear and consistent, and his final decision to recalibrate the floodgate feels earned by what we’ve seen. Interiority is specific (his reaction to the chain, the letter, the basin) rather than generic, and his competence reads credibly. The internal conflict could be sharpened with more live contradiction on the page—he rarely seems genuinely tempted to choose wrongly, which softens cost. Still, for this length, he reads as a particular, dimensional person rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s grief-driven motivation—to preserve his sister’s “lost song”—is clear, particular, and governs every choice, from attic exile to risking the meteorite chip. His reinvention as an attic-dweller and obsessive mapper of dust motes reads like a convincing, flawed coping strategy rather than a pose. The internal shift toward trusting his own method at the end feels earned by prior obsession and secrecy, with the cost of long-term isolation still palpable. A slightly sharper dramatization of his contradictory impulses in the peak beat (terror of losing the chip vs need to let it go) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elea’s core motivation—understanding thresholds and honoring “necessary distances”—is clear and consistent, and her method of reading wood grain gives her a distinctive cast. However, her emotional life is rendered more as concept than as embodied conflict; we see almost no concrete bodily reactions or messy contradictions under pressure. The relationship with her father is potent material but mostly summarized in aphoristic recollections (“All mazes teach patience”) rather than dramatized tensions. Her final stance as “guardian” feels thematically apt but carries little felt personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—to understand belonging through pattern—feels specific and is consistently linked to her actions (studying maps, pursuing the feather’s mystery, activating the system). Her competence is credible, but she faces little genuine resistance and exhibits limited internal contradiction, which flattens complexity. Kaelen functions mostly as a witnessing presence rather than an active relational crucible. The closing realization is emotionally plausible but edges toward tidy rather than conflicted growth.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aelia’s vocation, drive, and temperament are clear and specific, and her investigative focus on disappearing paths gives her a coherent through-line. However, her inner life remains mostly single-note—curious, diligent, mildly melancholy—without much contradictory impulse or visible cost beyond fatigue and bittersweetness. Her choices shape the inquiry but don’t really force sacrifice or expose sharper flaws. The ending reads more as continued endurance than as a charged renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motivation—“to serenade monotony with creativity” by ordering randomness—is clear and consistent, and his small choices (placing the bishop, following the note) track with that. However, his interiority remains relatively smooth; there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle once the plan is underway. The woman is mostly a function (messenger/co-conspirator) rather than a fully pressured character. The final beat suggests continuity more than a costly change, so his arc feels like a reaffirmation of who he already was.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lyra’s vocation, loss under the Nostalgia Ban, and drive to become “living scripture” are clear and consistent, and her agency in choosing to fledge drives the piece. However, she experiences almost no contradictory impulses on the page—no visible fear of failure, ambivalence about leaving exile, or attachment to her former life—so the change feels willed but not deeply contested. Embodied emotion appears in a few images (veins of light, warming moonstone) but remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The final transformation is earned in logic but light on dramatized inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glazier’s motivation is clear and particular—“to illuminate value in the mundane”—and his interior lens on the world is consistently rendered through how he reads ripples and light. However, he encounters almost no real resistance or competing impulse, so we don’t see genuine internal conflict or a hierarchy of values under pressure. His role as father and artisan appears as color more than a live fault line that complicates his choices in the scene. The final stance (walking away clear, with purpose reaffirmed) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is richly drawn, with concrete history, embodied scars, and a credible blend of competence, shame, and tenderness. His motivations for firefighting and for carrying the bell are clear and specific. However, the internal conflict resolves a bit too cleanly into insight, and several key beats lean on abstract or therapeutic language (“reframing his relationship to it”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction under pressure. The final stance feels earned but slightly tidy for the amount of pain invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to derive “equations for hope”—is clear and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions, and the logical/dreamer duality is distinct. However, her internal conflict stays mild; she rarely holds two incompatible impulses in live tension, so the final resolution (to share her equations) feels aspirational more than hard-won. Emotional states are mostly articulated via concept rather than deeply embodied sensation. The arc reads believable but relatively low-cost for this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s core motivation is clear and particular—“to discover what walls dream about”—and his sensitivity comes through in tactile, embodied beats (fingers on stone, shiver of something ancient). His realization about the previous cartographer and his own role is coherent but leans on exposition rather than a dramatized internal conflict. The “to the point of ruin” line gestures at contradiction without fully testing him on the page. The final shift from burdened to “chosen” is credible but feels more told than earned through concrete micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The painter’s vocation, heart-exchange, and solitary ritual give her a distinct, memorable interior world. Motivation is clear and consistent, but she experiences little on-page contradiction or genuine doubt under pressure. The heart swap is thematically rich yet mostly reflective, not actively forcing a hard choice in the present. Her emotional state remains almost uniformly serene, which limits dynamic character movement.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated by guilt and a desire for redemption, and the decision to perform this ritual instead of negotiating external peace is coherent and rooted in his history. The interiority is specific enough—clipboard as “ledger,” terrace as former ceasefire ground—to individualize him beyond a stock guilty negotiator. However, his internal conflict stays fairly linear (regret → ritual → resolve) with limited simultaneity of clashing impulses in the live moment. The closing shift to “redemption as journey” is earned but emotionally tidy, softening the sense of ongoing, costly contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is sharply drawn as a self-made ecological villain with an almost religious tenderness toward extinct birds, and his core motive—self-implicating preservation—is clear and specific. The tension between his public amorality and private sentimentality is convincingly embedded in his choices (funding drought vs. preserving species). Some emotional beats lean on telling or cliché shorthand (“secretly sentimental heart breaking for the thousandth time that day”) rather than fully embodied contradiction. Still, his interior logic holds and the final endurance—accepting the loss of the last egg in exchange for an echo—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with a clear conflict between the “lullaby of conformity” and her hunger for self-definition, and her micro-choices while handling each thread feel motivated. However, her life as a “chaste courtesan” remains almost entirely symbolic rather than concretely dramatized, so the cost of change feels slightly abstract. The final self-redefinition is mostly earned but a bit neat, with limited lingering ambiguity about her flaws or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is sharply sketched: the urbane, serene calligrapher whose ethical unease pushes him into bars with a puppet stage feels specific and coherent. His motivation—to test what “ethical storytelling” might mean in practice—is clear and drives his choices. What’s missing at this standard is more embodied contradiction under pressure; his serenity is asserted more than tested, so inner conflict stays somewhat conceptual. The final shift toward “asking better questions” feels earned but pays an intellectual cost more than an emotional one.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation—honoring the last monarchs and overlooked histories—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through his ritualized building. Interiority is concrete and filtered through his aesthetic philosophy (“esoteric realist”), which gives him texture beyond a generic contemplative. However, his internal conflict is muted: there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; he mostly serenely enacts a worldview he already holds. The final “earned stasis” (continuing to move on, not preserving the work) fits, but the emotional cost of that renunciation could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The caster’s guilt and desire to preserve forgotten names are clear, consistent, and anchored in concrete vocation details, and his final realization about listening rather than creating grows plausibly from that setup. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized (we’re told he forgave himself years ago) rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses in the moment. The shift from burdened to light-hearted feels a bit too smooth and unresisted, with little on-page struggle once the ritual begins. Strong, specific interiority, but not yet at the rigor or ambiguity level of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s foresight-driven behavior, playful precision, and philosophical preoccupation with “paths” form a coherent, particular interiority, and his final acceptance of being “created by necessity” feels earned by the preceding setup. However, he experiences little genuine friction or degradation under pressure; the gift/curse of his perception never meaningfully pulls him in two directions in-scene. Emotional embodiment is mostly intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral. The closing shift reads as reflective clarity more than a costly, conflict-ridden change.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—decipher the tile and complete the ritual before the regime change—and his interiority is textured (the “encrypted devotion” and “empirically ironic” stance feel character-particular). However, he experiences little active internal conflict; once we enter the night, his certainty is never seriously troubled. His final change (the pact becoming part of him) is conceptually strong but emotionally under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s pacifist, quasi-mystic role is clear and consistent, and Leo/Maya each get a specific wound and visible emotional reaction. However, Elias is almost entirely unconflicted and saintly; we’re told his “scheming” became compassion without ever really seeing the schemer. The rapid, near-identical breakthroughs for each visitor edge toward unearned epiphany, with little messy contradiction on the page. The final note that he “healed parts of himself” is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s vocation, patience, and quiet obsession are convincingly rendered, and his motivation to reclaim the astronomer’s dream is clear and consistent. However, he faces little moral or emotional friction; we rarely see contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. His groundedness versus the dream’s elusiveness hints at a richer internal conflict that never fully sharpens into a difficult choice. The ending registers more as serene fulfillment than a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mender’s motivation—to repair an emotional breach using the tools of her trade—is clear, specific, and consistent, and her small choices (climbing to the rafters, planting the ribbon and relics) align tightly with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character-colored (“false, but functional” quartz eye; dirt-stained fingers) rather than generic. However, internal conflict is relatively one-note (she is sad but steadfast; doubt and resentment don’t really contest her impulse to mend), so the final stance feels more like affirmation than a hard-won shift. The relationship with the daughter is emotionally present but entirely off-page, so we don’t see pressures in that dynamic actively reshaping her behavior in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Margaret’s motivation—to pursue forbidden knowledge and understand the cameo—is clear and consistent, and her eventual acceptance of the curator’s role feels earned. However, her inner life is reported more than embodied; we’re told of “philosophical breakthroughs” and bewilderment rather than seeing specific, conflicted reactions under pressure. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear/sanity) are implied but rarely dramatized in-the-moment. The lack of other on-page characters also flattens relational pressure that could sharpen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation to find Kael is clear, consistent, and expressed through profession-specific tactics (treating the bookstore as language, using the diary’s syntax). Her interiority is vivid but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so we feel less moment-by-moment conflict or fraying under pressure. Kael arrives very late as an on-page presence and functions more as an object of the quest than as a full character, which limits relational complexity. The final beat—her speaking his true name—lands as earned but could benefit from a bit more prior emotional texture between them.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    The twin’s motive (find the garden / become whole / free the ship) is clear and consistent, and the chimera nature provides a built-in contradiction. However, interiority leans abstract (“unkindled solace,” “fractured soul”) rather than embodied, so the emotional cost of becoming whole is more told than felt. Their final acceptance of their wholeness and liminal identity arrives smoothly, without much dramatized hesitation or competing impulse on the page. As a result, the arc is coherent but somewhat under-textured for top-tier literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation (“translate confusion into clarity”) is clear and consistently drives his actions, and his archivist mindset is nicely embodied in how he “catalogs” rope configurations. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he moves from curiosity to solution with little emotional friction, so his change at the end feels more like an affirmation than a costly evolution. The warmth in his response to wonder is specific and appealing but largely untested under pressure. Overall, strong but not yet deeply conflicted characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lorne’s motivation (to restore silence and protect his home) is clear and consistent, and his profession as a “ripple-mark mapkeeper” gives him a distinct lens. However, he faces little internal contradiction—no serious doubt, resentment, or temptation to give up—so his emotional range stays narrow. His choices are mostly procedural rather than morally or psychologically fraught, which flattens potential complexity. The endurance at the end reads as principled but not particularly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s core motivation (to keep the beacon burning and prove coincidences have meaning) is clear and consistent, and his professional competence is well grounded in detail. However, his emotional life remains relatively smooth; there’s little on-page doubt, fear, or conflicting impulse under pressure. The final “cloak woven from starlight and silence” reads as a clean victory without visible ambivalence or cost. A touch more friction—self-doubt, weariness, or moral unease—would give the arc greater depth.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s vocation and core drive are clear and consistent, and his sensory attention is specific enough to feel character-bound. However, his interiority leans abstract and repetitive (“preemptively nostalgic”) rather than revealing sharp, contradictory impulses under pressure. His revelation about the fog’s timeline and his subsequent resolve register as a mild deepening rather than a change with real cost. The piece could reach higher if his nostalgia and duty pulled him in more visibly opposed directions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marlo’s vocation, philosophy about fireworks, and search for relief from hopelessness give them a clear, consistent motivation, and their use of the knot to reveal the mosaics is a coherent choice. However, internal conflict is relatively low-friction; we’re told of hopelessness more than we feel it embodied in contradiction or costly hesitation. The renewed purpose at the end is plausible but emotionally easy—no path is truly foreclosed or sacrifice made. Marlo remains more archetypal than fully individuated, which holds this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s interiority is rich, particular, and consistent, with their observational, tangential mindset dramatized through how they handle the impending conversation. The cost of that temperament—deferring direct engagement—is implied but could be made sharper on the page. Mara, however, remains somewhat underdefined; her unreadable expression and softening are clear, but her specific motives and contradictions never fully crystallize. The final shift toward speaking feels emotionally plausible but slightly under-costed because we haven’t seen more of what either truly risks losing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation and sensory way of experiencing the world are vivid, and the doll-linked compulsion feels specific rather than generic. However, she faces almost no conflicted impulses in scene—once the trellis appears, she simply does what she already wants to do. Claustrophobia and her relationship with her father are named but never meaningfully pressure or complicate her choices. The ending’s change (becoming a “vault of stolen quiet”) is evocative but carries little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to soothe and recalibrate the terrace’s silence—is clear and consistent, and the storm glass offers a nice window into her professional care. However, she faces almost no genuine resistance or meaningful dilemma, so we never see contradictory impulses or real strain. Her competence remains untested, which makes the final contentment feel costless. The characterization is specific but emotionally shallow for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s core motivation (decode shard, reach stairway) is clear and consistent, and his role as multigenerational lore keeper gives him a specific identity. However, interiority leans generic (“wisely adventurous,” “heart raced”) and largely affirms his nobility rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses under pressure. We rarely see real hesitation between safety and quest, so key choices (sneaking out, ascending, returning) feel foregone rather than wrestled with. The final renunciation of personal glory in favor of stewardship is thematically apt but not deeply earned through prior inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and conflicted—her urge to isolate versus her compulsion to heal through shared pain is clear and drives the final choice. The surgeon/necrotic tissue metaphor for cutting ties grounds her psychology in a concrete, character-particular image. Her final decision to reestablish a severed connection feels motivated by prior cost and miscalculation, not manufactured. Some emotion is summarized in slightly abstract terms (“motivation, the one truth that sustained her”), which keeps this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    Leo’s core motivation (healing from pyramid-scheme trauma) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it. However, his interiority leans on summary (“weight of his past was gone”) rather than conflicted, embodied emotion in the peak beat. The transformation feels somewhat easy and unopposed—there’s little sense of simultaneous fear/hope or doubt/need as he performs the ritual. Mara reads as a functional catalyst with minimal depth or pressure on Leo.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s core motivation—to uncover a hidden truth in his bloodline—is clear and consistent, and his engagement with the gramophone produces a credible internal shift. However, he encounters minimal resistance, and his emotional life stays relatively smooth; there’s little sense of genuine internal contradiction or messy, layered feeling under pressure. The revelation that his ancestors built “a prison” lands more as declarative insight than as a painful, dramatized reckoning. His final resolve feels earned but low-cost, more like the end of a prologue than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    The knight’s motivation (“to capture the shape of possibility”) is clear and carried through to the end, and his allegiance shift from king/cause to “what could be” lands as a genuine change. However, he feels more like an archetype than an individual; “withdrawn” is asserted but never really dramatized in behavior or contradiction. Internal conflict is minimal—he moves fairly serenely from curiosity to fulfillment without friction or self-sabotage. The final transformation to “keeper of what could be” is conceptually earned but emotionally under-textured.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his broken-heartedness, archivist sensibility, and quiet reverence for marginalia feel specific and credible, and his choices (opening the ledger, tracing Micah, pairing button and drawing) all arise cleanly from those traits. The interiority is concrete and character-particular rather than generic. The main limitation is a lack of on-page contradiction or real internal friction; his arc from hurt to slightly hopeful reads relatively smooth and low-cost. The final realization is earned but a bit tidy, with little sense of live alternative paths he might have taken.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maya’s core motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her role as an “underestimated rebel” is well established through her maintenance cover and tech scavenging. However, her emotional life is mostly summarized rather than embodied, with little contradictory impulse or felt fear around the very real risk she’s taking. Internal conflict is minimal—she never seriously wavers, which flattens her complexity. The closing endurance stance (returning to unassuming work while continuing resistance) is earned but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and burden are clear and specific—protecting the town’s memory through a private, costly ritual—and the link to his relationship with the dead composer gives him dimensionality. His interiority is grounded in concrete perceptions (dew, glass, light) rather than label-only feelings. However, internal conflict is relatively mild: we don’t see him pulled strongly between competing impulses so much as steadily fulfilling a duty he has already accepted. The final endurance choice (to keep returning) is credible but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has clear, particular motives (sorting, decoding leaves, building monuments) that feel organically tied to his work and world. His decision to prod the speck is motivated by folklore and curiosity, and his shift from sorter to keeper is coherent. However, his emotional life remains relatively undual—there’s wonder but little contradiction or visible fear/cost as reality upends, which keeps the arc from feeling fully lived-in. The transformation is compelling but a bit too frictionless for top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tinkerer’s motivations and contradictions (fixing time vs. accepting brokenness) are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in his choice to descend without tools and later to release the clock parts. Interiority is particular enough—his admiration for the “honest” compass, his attraction to uncertainty—to avoid stock psychology. The final shift from compulsion to fix toward accepting broken clocks reads earned by prior traits. Emotional life could be more embodied under stress; he remains slightly too composed and reflective during the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, and his profession as a “balanced alchemist” meshes cleanly with his emotional state. His motivations—to understand Lyra’s absence and his own failure—are clear and plausibly drive his choice to remake the coin. The final reconfiguration from self-flagellation to a more accepting stance feels earned by the preceding reflection. The main limitation is that his internal conflict is more articulated than dramatized in live, pressured choices, so contradictions don’t quite bite as hard as they might.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    The collector’s purpose and temperament are clear, and small embodied moments (“His chest tightened with a luminous ache”) keep him from feeling generic. However, his internal conflict is very low; nothing meaningfully tests or complicates his desire to heal, so we don’t see contradictory impulses in action. The spirits function more as catalysts than distinct characters under pressure. His final choice to leave the tooth is evocative but not deeply hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and particular, with the proprioceptive enhancement and phantom mask-pressure giving his psychology a concrete texture. Motivation (seeking the “mathematics of mercy”) is clearly rooted in his torture history and drives his consent to the procedure and his present struggle. The final shift—from “just a survivor” to “a pioneer” using his trauma as an instrument—feels earned by the preceding sensations and realizations. There is a mild tendency toward diagnostic labeling (“enhanced interrogation survivor,” “proprioceptively enhanced”) that flattens some emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The translator’s vocation, childhood obsessions, and present quest align into a coherent, motivated psyche, and her decision to turn from magical seeking to mundane writing is credibly earned. However, her interior conflict is more stated than dramatized; we rarely see genuinely competing impulses under pressure. Emotional texture leans on recurring abstractions (“anchor of intuition,” “overlooked histories”) rather than sharply individuating quirks or contradictions. The lineage revelation moment works, but the cost of accepting an ordinary fragment over a magical one could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The technician’s motive and worldview are clear and particular—his focus on ceilings and “imprints” rather than standard ghosts gives him specificity. However, his emotional life remains cool and mostly implied; we get little contradiction or real internal friction as he works. His competence is convincing, but the lack of genuine struggle or ambivalence undercuts depth. The final choice to pocket the barrel feels appropriate but not sharply costed on a character level.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias has a clear defining trait (秩序, ritual) and a concrete motivation (to compress eternity into a moment), and his micro-choices—pocketing the bottle, leaving the press, pulling the lever, leaping—track consistently with that. The contrast between his precision and the encroaching whispers gives him a credible internal tension. However, his emotional experience at the key turns (especially the final leap) feels somewhat summarized rather than fully embodied, muting the sense of real risk. The transformation from “letterpress operator” to “just a man” is conceptually strong but could use one more beat of conflicted interiority to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to reimagine a civilization through its quiet sorrows—is clear and integrated with his past as a failed revolutionary and his present as a marginal scholar. His choices (performing the mirror ritual, stealing the shard, rejecting the board) align cleanly with that motive. Interiority is specific and textured, but his internal conflict is relatively muted; we rarely feel true contradiction beyond sentiment versus institutional coldness. The final renunciation (no report to the board) is credible and carries some cost, though the cost remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, ethics, and quiet devotion are vivid and consistent, and his motivation to restore the town’s light is clear and rooted in backstory craft (parents, rust, invisible repairs). However, he faces almost no real internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; he never wavers, doubts, or chooses between competing values. His “gift” and competence are so untroubled that the final success feels more like fulfillment of design than a pressured character decision. This keeps the arc from feeling as psychologically rich as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically odd; his shift from “collector of traces” to “pursuer of the source” feels earned by the compass and the lagoon. Interiority is concrete and filtered through his sensibility (petrichor, “auditory clearing,” stone as interlocutor). The final renunciation—leaving the compass and returning to the surface—tracks persuasively with his reinterpreted lifelong drive and carries a quiet cost. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper on-page friction between competing impulses at the lagoon (to dissolve vs. to return) that makes his choice feel more embattled in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s vocation, sensibility, and “perpetually learning” mindset are consistently rendered, but she reads more as a symbolic figure than a fully contradictory, pressured person. Her major choice—accepting the slide’s guidance and completing the alliance—faces almost no resistance or moral friction, so change comes cheaply. Interiority leans thematic (“timewoven alliances,” “scaffolding complexity with simplicity”) rather than character-particular thought. The absence of real cost or mistake undercuts the feeling of an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s obsession is clear and consistent, and her quiet drive is convincingly shown across the seasonal progression and in her compulsion to decode the postcards. However, much of her inner life is summarized rather than dramatized in specific, pressured moments, so we get less in-scene contradiction or embodied emotional struggle. The final softening into contentment feels earned but relatively low-cost, with her “reckoning” more told than enacted. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at truly piercing depth.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s vocation and temperament (solemn civil-rights archivist) are specific and thematically integrated, and his choice to descend and then to remain the lagoon’s “translator” tracks cleanly with his motives. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: once the diary “turns his bones to water,” he largely complies with its pull without much on-page resistance or contradiction. Emotional states are often summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final stance feels earned conceptually but a bit easy emotionally, with limited visible cost beyond haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to rebuild a better civilization and refuses easy answers—and his process of weighing art vs sustenance, democracy vs elders gives him some dimensionality. However, his internal conflict resolves very smoothly with little felt cost or contradiction, and the emotions are often summarized in abstractions (“weight…like lead,” “deliberate act of love”) rather than rendered in more idiosyncratic embodiment. The final shift from “deserted alchemist” to “founder” is earned but emotionally under-complicated for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, gift, and obsession are sharply drawn and his final choice—to let the prophecy rewrite him—feels motivated by those established traits. The interiority is concrete (“fingers—accustomed to deciphering the delicate bones of dead words”) and particular, though we don’t see much true contradiction or irrational resistance under pressure. His decision to “immerse himself fully” arrives quickly and cleanly, with little sense of competing impulses or cost beyond implication. As a result, the transformation is compelling but somewhat too smooth for top-tier psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation and inner state (“furiously tranquil,” burdened with vortex inheritance) are clear and consistent, and her choices directly express those traits. However, internal conflict is muted; she rarely feels torn or genuinely imperiled, so the change from frantic archivist-lineage to serene keeper of balance reads more conceptual than emotionally costly. The brief interaction with the great-grandmother has symbolic weight but little relational texture (no history, no friction). The final transformation is credible but lands as a graceful step rather than a hard-won, contradictory choice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian is clearly sketched as a meticulous, quietly devoted technician with a coherent philosophy and believable occupational mindset. However, his inner life remains relatively simple: there’s little contradiction, fear, or genuine doubt under pressure, and the emotional range seldom goes beyond calm focus and satisfaction. His choices (testing, switching to the bell, logging data) are all professionally appropriate but not deeply revealing of conflicting values. The final stance—content preparedness—feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—spiritual curiosity and a desire to connect with forgotten cosmos—is clear and consistent, and her choice to embrace isolation is credibly rooted in those traits. Her inner life is present but leans idealized; there’s little simultaneous contradiction or genuine moral mess to complicate her serenity. The change at the end (reframing strength as acceptance of vulnerability) is earned by the preceding practice with the lantern. Still, the emotional register stays relatively even, so we don’t see her values tested under sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elisha is clearly drawn as a gentle, solitary interpreter whose actions—reading the box, moving it to the hive, choosing to mediate—are motivated and consistent with his character. His interiority is mostly filtered through perception and awe rather than contradiction, so we don’t see many competing impulses under pressure. The core choice to reaffirm the covenant feels earned but relatively low-cost, with little sense of what it would mean for him personally to fail. Still, his role as “astonished recluse, peaceful interpreter” is distinct and specific, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s core motive—understanding the “texture of time passing” while on borrowed time—is clear and consistent, and his choices (decoding the message trail, descending beneath the silo) align with it. However, his interiority stays mostly at the level of articulated purpose and awe; we get little contradictory impulse or embodied emotional struggle as he proceeds. The “borrowed time” condition is mentioned but never really pressures his decisions or behavior on the page. The final reconfiguration from curse to gift works conceptually but feels somewhat declared rather than earned through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s core motivation—finding beauty in the incomplete—is clear and consistently embodied in their choices (catching the kite, weaving feather and string, then relinquishing the sculpture). Interiority is specific and grounded in sensory experience rather than labels. However, internal conflict is relatively gentle; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses under real pressure, so the final “purpose” feels more like confirmation than a costly shift. The emotional arc is convincing but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motive (to unlock the temple’s secrets and foster interspecies respect before he dies) is clear and consistently expressed, and his occupational habits (the diary, methodical experimentation) give him specificity. However, his emotional range is narrow—he moves quickly to acceptance, with little felt contradiction between fear and purpose beyond a few “sleepless nights.” The final Earned Stasis (sitting in the orchard, accepting death) is credible but not deeply contested on the page, which keeps the character arc strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris is clearly drawn as a skeptical, intellectually proud figure whose inner stance shifts credibly toward belief, with the loss of the amber and his altered self-conception carrying real cost. His interiority is fairly specific (“luminous skeptic,” “Academically rebellious”), and his micro-choices—following the footprints, deciding to place the amber—track with that setup. The main weakness is that his epiphany (“Aris understood”) happens quickly and leans on abstraction rather than being fully dramatized through more conflicted, embodied hesitation at the pedestal.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    The coachman’s motivation (restoring a lost concord, turning a battlefield into a garden) is clear and consistent, and his weariness lends him some texture. However, his interiority stays largely emblematic rather than idiosyncratic—he’s more archetype than person, with little true contradiction or live internal conflict. Micro-choices under pressure are limited mostly to “whether and how” to scatter seeds, which are never substantially tested or doubted. The piece gestures toward ancient burden and loneliness but doesn’t dramatize those tensions in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (finding his sister, turning war-honed skills toward connection) is clear, consistent, and nicely embedded in his sensory focus on grooves and textures. Interiority is particular—his “kennel-bred instincts” and intuitive translations are vivid—but we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure or a hard trade-off; the piece stays in a gentle, contemplative register. His final decision to go to the bridge tomorrow is credible but low-cost, more continuation than rupture. Strong, specific characterization, but not yet at the level of complex conflict or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn: a “blessed pariah” whose grief, guilt, and peculiar competence all inform what he notices and how he reacts. His motivation to transform exile into exploration is clear and pays off in his choice to become a “cartographer of lost moments.” The main limitation is that internal contradiction is muted—his transition from isolation to purpose is emotionally smooth, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage. A touch more friction between despair and discovery at the moment of the shimmer would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivations (protecting the world’s wildness, conflicted loyalty to the Architect, love of abandon) are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (entering via the skylight, engaging in the ritual, relinquishing the sundial) track with those motives. The internal conflict between caution and abandon is named and lightly dramatized but could be embodied more viscerally under pressure. The Architect has a distinct presence—curious, playful, dangerous—but his interiority and the cost of his concession remain relatively underexplored. The closing shift from apprentice to “keeper of wonders” is earned in concept, though the emotional price of leaving the relationship could be made sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—the crisis actor / crisis survivor split and the “historian of small gestures” vocation give her a distinctive psychology. However, much of her conflict is articulated in summary rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured choices in scene. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting her nomadic penumbra as method) is emotionally plausible but carries limited felt cost on the page. More contradiction-in-action, rather than explanation of contradiction, would lift this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her motivation (escaping painful memory toward a reclaimed sense of home) is clear and consistent, and interiority is textured rather than generic. However, the piece leans on summary over in-scene micro-choices, so contradictory impulses under live pressure (fear of loss vs hunger for the new reality) are gestured at more than dramatized. The final stance—possibly not returning—is emotionally plausible and earned but could land with sharper cost if earlier ambivalence were more concretely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tutor’s guilt and need for redemption are clearly motivated and consistently embodied (especially through his “fidgets” and chess-pattern thinking). His final choice at the stalemated board is cleanly earned by the earlier setup of his past mistake. However, his internal conflict stays fairly one-note—remorse moving to release—without much simultaneous contradiction or moral ambiguity. The ending emotional resolution feels a bit too tidy for someone who has carried such weight “for years.”

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elaran’s defiance, curiosity, and guilt are clearly motivated and consistent, and his final choice to “refract” the truth into palatable verses grows logically from those traits. The internal conflict between artist and community member is well articulated but leans on summary rather than fully embodied, scene-level strain. His emotions skew conceptual (“terrible gravity,” “weight of knowledge”) more than physical or sensory. The cost of his choice remains mostly anticipatory, so his change feels intellectually clear but only moderately felt.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    The alchemist’s core motivation—to mend and make meaning from ruin—is clear and consistent, and his persistence during the wave gives him some lived texture. However, his “uncertainty” is mostly asserted rather than dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional states skew toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied specificity, so we rarely feel his fear or doubt in the body. The final realization lands, but it costs him little beyond exertion, which keeps the internal arc from fully earning its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s interiority is coherent and particular—his lifelong relationship with the quay, shell, and cracked mirror gives him specificity beyond a generic “old artist.” His core motivation (keeping an unbreakable memory/promise) clearly underlies both the painting and the final release of the shell. However, his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t feel him genuinely torn in the moment of submerging the shell so much as accepting an already-processed insight. The final acceptance feels earned but a bit smooth, without much mess or visible struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (to test his theory and reach a specific silent person) is clear and consistently embodied in his actions. Interiority is rich and particular—details like “screaming tenderness” and the ritualized regard for the cork make him feel specific, not generic. The internal conflict is quieter than it could be; we get more devotion than genuinely torn impulses, so the final calm costs him less overtly on the page. Still, his final relinquishing of the cork reads as an earned, vulnerable choice that forecloses clinging to certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The navigator’s grief, attachment to the censer foot, and dependence on the midnight calls create a clear, particular psychology. His choice not to answer the phone and to “walk…through” grief instead of around or back from it feels earned by prior beats. Interiority is specific and grounded in tactile detail (coat patches, censer heat) rather than labels. The internal conflict between clinging to the method and letting it go is present, though it could be sharpened with one or two more concrete, conflicted micro-choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s core motivation—desperate need for psychological safety despite believing in rational self-sufficiency—is clear and specific, and her choice to use the eye in front of a stranger is well-motivated. The involuntary truthfulness is nicely dramatized when her fear and suspicion spill into the stranger, giving her a real constraint. Internal conflict is present but a bit underdeveloped; we’re told she’s rational but don’t see that rationality significantly complicate or nuance her decision beyond “no better time than now.” The stranger remains more symbol than person, limiting the relational crucible and emotional cost of Elara’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Hemlock is clearly drawn—eccentric, burdened by inherited “borrowed memories,” and motivated by a need to witness others’ loneliness—yet he faces little genuine internal contradiction or hard choice. His emotional life is conveyed through some concrete embodiment (trembling hands, ritual gestures) and a lot of summary about his role as keeper of memories. The final “change” (adopting the Edelweiss ritual) feels emotionally apt but low-cost, more deepening than transformation. Strong, coherent characterization, but without the sharper edges or genuine ambivalence that would push it into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is clearly drawn, with credible loneliness, attentiveness, and a quiet hunger for meaning, and his micro-choices (following the ants, pressing the chip into the stone, touching his own map) track well with those traits. The internal shift from keeper-of-others’ stories to author-of-his-own is coherent and grounded in prior setup (Clara, the chip, his intimacy with maps). However, the emotional conflict is a little too tidy: we don’t see real resistance, fear, or competing impulses at the key moment, so the change feels smooth rather than hard-won. The piece would benefit from more embodied ambivalence when he confronts the map with his name on it.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The queen’s motivation (recurring dreams, disenchantment with rule) is clear and drives action, and her celestial identity reveal tracks logically with those set-ups. However, her internal conflict—duty to the kingdom versus reclaiming her true nature—never quite bites; the choice to abandon the realm feels too smooth. The seneschal’s loyalty and secret knowledge add an interesting relational layer but remain underdeveloped. A bit more embodied hesitation or contradiction at the moment of decision would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s vocation and worldview (“scientifically romantic,” obsessed with “density of presence”) are clear and consistent, and her choice to transform the moment into a star is motivated. However, she faces almost no genuine resistance—internal or external—so we see little contradiction or cost, and Kael functions mainly as a trigger rather than a pressure-bearing presence. The relationship has emotional potential but is under-exploited as a crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and self-contradictory: envy of past selves, dread of the grave, and a late reframing of his condition coexist on the page. His profession and coping methods feel integrated with his psychology. The emotional arc from bitterness to a wary, costly acceptance reads earned, if quiet. Slightly more embodied behavior under pressure would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her anosmia, tactile focus, and grief over her grandmother feel lived rather than labeled. Her motive for engaging the screw (to reconstruct a lost emotional and sensory lineage) cleanly drives the scene and culminates in the final stance shift. The emotional turn on discovering “L. 1923” is well prepared. There is some safety in how tidy the final hope feels; her contradictions and flaws under pressure could be sharpened further.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aeris’s motivation—to rework trauma into authored meaning—is clear from the outset and drives every choice, from gripping the quill like “a bit of night-sky” to writing the childish prayer. His interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic, full of rune-scholar logic straining against superstition. The shift from terror at his crystallizing hand to acceptance of the permanent, smoothed scar feels earned and costly. There’s room for slightly more contradictory impulse (e.g., a stronger urge to abort the ritual) under peak pressure, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eloise’s motivation (an overdue apology) is clear and compelling, and specific touches like her custom-built device and occupational lens give her texture. However, the emotional history with Alistair is only sketched, so her guilt and fear don’t fully complicate her on-page choices. Their reconciliation feels a bit too smooth; there’s little sense of her wrestling with contradictory impulses in the moment. Alistair’s character is mostly delivered through neat, confessional lines rather than dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is more archetype than individuated person, but his role as “end of history witness” is coherent and his motive—to repair fractured reality via language—is consistent. Interiority leans abstract (“sacrifice…certainty itself”) with little embodied emotional contradiction, so the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. His final unification with the dictionary registers as a change, but the preceding micro-choices and doubts aren’t sharply dramatized. The piece would benefit from one or two concrete, character-particular hesitations or blind spots under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is specific and credible: a long-serving technician whose odd habits (talking to clocks, squinting, logbook notations) coherently express his obsession. His motivation—to understand what clocks truly measure—is clear and drives his attention and small experimental choices. However, internal conflict remains relatively mild and largely abstract; we don’t feel much lived cost or contradiction beyond being dismissed as “peculiar.” The final realization is earned but emotionally underpowered, reading more as tidy insight than as something wrestled from genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and inner world are clear and particular—the “physics of letting go” and his spatial mapping give him a distinct lens. The woman’s complementary motive (measuring gaps) is also cleanly sketched and their rapport feels plausible. However, internal conflict is relatively mild; Elias moves from obsession to revelation with little resistance or cost. The final shift toward collaboration is emotionally credible but feels somewhat easy, without a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—probability-bred daughter versus compulsive, “theoretically rebellious” gambler—feels specific and drives her choices (subway quest, gift to her father). Her motivation to widen his perspective after the heart attack is clear and consistent. The father is sketched efficiently, and his emotional softening is believable, though his shift comes a bit quickly and tidily. Emotional embodiment leans more on lyrical description than messy, in-scene struggle, which keeps this short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Archie’s interiority is distinct—his “cultivated estrangement” and dependence on the loop feel specific, and the detail that he once was a caller himself adds depth. His motivation to keep serving callers instead of breaking the loop is coherent and consistent with his temperament. The late realization that he needs “connection at the right distance” and the hint of his own eventual final call provide a modest but earned internal shift. However, the story mostly summarizes his behavior rather than dramatizing a live, pressured choice, so his contradictions never quite combust on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief, vocation, and belief in the covenant produce a coherent, particular interiority, and his final choice to surrender the locket aligns with the long-built sense of duty and love. The archivist details (walnut-ink, conservatory, method) feel lived-in and character-specific. However, his internal conflict is underdramatized: he never seriously wavers between preserving Melina’s memory and offering the locket, so the peak decision feels inevitable rather than pressured. More on-page contradiction or hesitation at the jetty would deepen the sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orion’s mix of competence, evasiveness around gratitude, and "polite anarchy" gives him specificity, and his loneliness is embodied through small choices (talking to ivy, offering up the moon rock). His motivation—to seek a “cure”—is clear and consistent, and the final conceptual shift (loneliness as visitor, not resident) is earned by what he experiences in the cupola. The woman is thinly drawn but functional as a catalyst, with just enough enigmatic presence to pressure him. The main limitation is that his internal conflict (wanting an external fix vs fearing real connection) stays more implied than fully dramatized in scene, so the shift lands slightly more as essayed insight than as behavior-under-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is vivid and particular (“selfish and sacred”), and his embodied way of sensing the world strongly individualizes him. The quest to quiet his inner storm gives clear drive, and the invention of his own dowsing method adds character specificity. However, internal conflict is relatively simple—there’s little on-page contradiction or genuine risk that he might turn back or fail. The final change, while moving, feels more like a graceful slide into enlightenment than a choice with sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The interpreter’s motivation (to “fix” history while treasuring the resulting doubt) is clear and specific, and the central choice between erasing the seeds and reframing them feels earned. Internal contradiction is present—the longing for order versus the attachment to the messy garden of doubt. However, emotional experience skews abstract and conceptual; there’s limited embodied feeling or idiosyncratic physical reaction to deepen individuality. The arc lands, but it reads more like an elegant philosophical stance than a fully lived psychological moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    Julian and Lyra’s motives—to make the forgotten remembered by translating silence—are clear and consistent, with nice touches like the inherited camera and Lyra’s role as both collaborator and translator. However, their interior conflict remains relatively abstract; we’re told about “bittersweet joy” and “sorrow of loss” without many concrete, character-specific contradictions under pressure. The relationship has tenderness and shared purpose but doesn’t truly become a crucible that forces a difficult choice. The final stance (“your work becomes your ghost”) feels more like a statement of ethos than the culmination of a hard-earned internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply etched: a former arsonist turned archivist, driven by a vow to her mother and a complex relationship to fire and memory. Her interiority feels specific (“slow, volcanic tenderness of cooling lava”) and her choices—following the fragments, restoring the leader’s face, then burning the scroll—arise plausibly from her history. The final act of burning as both repetition and revision of her past crime is thematically apt, though the moment could use a touch more on-page hesitation or counter-impulse. Overall, the arc from destroyer to paradoxical restorer-with-fire reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s motivation—to preserve the shared dream and resist the experimenters’ erasure—is clear and consistent, and his choice to lean into resonance rather than submit feels earned. However, his interiority stays at a somewhat generalized, lyrical level; we don’t get many specific, idiosyncratic thoughts that distinguish him as an individual beyond “resilient conduit/dreamer.” Contradictory impulses (fear vs defiance, self-preservation vs sacrifice) are mostly implied, not dramatized in concrete micro-choices. The emotional cost at the end (“tears streaking his face,” a burden lifted) is present but could be sharper and more particular.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael has a clear, consistent motivation (prove his acoustic theory, explore the labyrinth) and a recognizable professional mindset, and his generosity at the end is earned by prior cues. However, his inner conflict is minimal—he never seems genuinely at risk of losing face, the coin, or control—so his final stance doesn’t feel like a costly shift. Jenna’s arc from scoffing rival to impressed collaborator is plausible but shallow and very fast. The sense that “the labyrinth is alive” is more conceptual than emotionally integrated into Kael’s psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian and Anna are clearly defined and their motives (his quiet vocation, her unresolved grief) are legible, with his long-term watching giving a nice sense of commitment. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized—Anna’s grief and the guardian’s empathy rarely manifest in concrete, character-particular thoughts or contradictions. The relationship dynamic is gentle but lacks a crucible moment; neither is forced into a difficult, value-testing choice. The final shift in Anna’s understanding feels earned but somewhat easy, with little sense of what it costs her beyond tears.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arthur’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and the unspoken-words ability gives him a distinctive inner life. However, he encounters little direct opposition on the page, so we don’t see him under real pressure or having to choose between conflicting impulses. The “once drove him to isolation” history is summarized rather than dramatized, which softens the felt cost. The ending registers as a gentle endurance/commitment rather than a hard, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is clear and specific—her grace versus the “brutish labor,” her guardedness, her ritual dives—and her motives around freedom and self-acceptance are legible and consistent. The internal conflict between conformity and her own nature is present but resolved somewhat too smoothly once the island appears, with limited dramatized resistance or error. The pivotal choice at the tree (to take a charm and “unlock” herself) is motivated, but the cost of leaving or changing her life is asserted more than felt moment to moment. Overall, she reads as a real person with a credible arc, but the transformation could use more friction and contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply drawn as someone performing compliance while quietly rebelling, with clear motivation rooted in grief and love for Maya. The contrast between their theatrical inner life and enforced blankness is compelling and consistent. However, their internal conflict remains relatively smooth—there’s little moment where fear of exposure actually shakes that poise on the page. The inspector never quite becomes a real relational crucible, which limits how far their characterization can sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael has a clear, consistent motivation (crossing the once-sacred boundary) and a distinctive identity as a “cloud-shadow poet,” but his internal conflict is minimal and mostly summarized (“his poet’s soul stirred not by fear but by the allure of the unattainable”). He rarely wavers or struggles; the transition from paraphrasing to dissolving into the colonnade is more told than dramatized. The final transformation into “a living embodiment of his art” reads as earned conceptually but lacks a sharply felt cost on the page. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly compelling psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Leo’s desire and worldview are clearly articulated and his choices (courting Lyra’s attention with flowers, accepting the bargain, using the reed) align with those motives in a consistent, character-specific way. His interiority—seeing the world as “values” and using plant symbolism as language—feels particular rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is underplayed: we’re told he values beauty in imperfection, yet his emotional conflict about radically “correcting” his perception is mostly implied rather than dramatized. Lyra functions more as an enigmatic catalyst than a fully pressured relationship, which keeps the crucible relatively mild.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The bell ringer has a clear, consistent motivation and a gentle, contemplative temperament, but they read more as an emblematic figure than a fully individuated person. Interiority is dominated by philosophical musing rather than concrete, character-particular contradictions. The “artificial pilgrimage” realization lands, yet it feels like an easy enlightenment without much dramatized struggle or cost. Embodied emotion is present in hints (vibrations up the spine, the smile), but remains largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian is specific and textured—a mourning jeweler whose grief has been transmuted into pedagogy—and his vocational details nicely reveal character. Motivation rooted in his daughter is clear and consistent, and his ongoing choice to recruit and teach others tracks with that. However, most of his transformation is recounted as already complete, so we don't see many live contradictory impulses or pressured micro-choices on the page. The emotional weather stays relatively even, giving less sense of messy, ongoing internal conflict than the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara is clearly drawn as patient, intellectual, and reverent toward her grandmother’s legacy, and her choice to confide in Chen and recommit to the work is motivated and consistent. However, her inner life stays mostly calm and confident; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt about the burden or risk of this knowledge. Professor Chen functions more as an appreciative witness than a source of pressure. The result is a solid but not deeply conflict-rich characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    Her core drive (forbidden knowledge) is clear and consistent, and the final acceptance of responsibility as “keeper” lands plausibly off that motive. However, interiority leans on generalized abstractions (“Knowledge, she had learned, contained its own form of self-preservation”) rather than character-specific thought, and contradictory impulses are mostly asserted in one line of “anguished joy” instead of dramatized through concrete choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role and motivation—to notice dusk-changes and preserve hope—are clear and consistent, and her embodied relationship with the stone gives her some specificity. However, she faces little on-page resistance; her “metamorphosis” reads more as a function upgrade than a pressured, contradictory internal arc. We don’t see genuine missteps, moral compromise, or competing impulses undercut her competence, which keeps the emotional cost of her final vigilance somewhat abstract. The luminous regret is evocative but not deeply individuated beyond its label.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maria’s motivation—to sift truth from deception and salvage her self-respect—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her professional habits, and the sister dynamic gives her something to push against. Her methodical reconstruction and refusal to “ignore what happened” show values under pressure rather than just telling us what they are. However, the internal conflict between anger, guilt, and compassion is mostly articulated in tidy dialogue instead of flaring into more contradictory, messy behavior on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya is specific, flawed, and motivated—her compulsion for closure, guilt over “displacing miracles,” and history with her father’s accident all feel coherent and drive her choices. The shift from scar-erasure to scar-translation is earned by the interior work on the page. Internal conflict is present (healer vs. eraser), though it’s articulated somewhat too cleanly rather than emerging through more fraught, contradictory impulses in scene. Samuel is a lightly sketched foil rather than a true crucible, but he suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gazer’s motivation—relief from a lifetime of unspent affection—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices. Interiority is rich and character-particular, especially his fixation on “where” unused love might be stored and his comfort with abstract spatial thinking. Internal contradiction is present but soft: he is desperate yet oddly clinical in his inquiry, and we don’t see much simultaneous push-pull beyond fear vs. curiosity. The final repricing of his own “unused love” as contribution rather than burden feels earned by the preceding obsession and vision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motive (freeing stifled creativity) is clear and consistent, and her embodied responses (trembling fingers, collapse, exhaustion) track. However, her interiority leans toward a single register of awed yearning without much contradictory impulse on the page—there’s little dramatized resistance or self-sabotage. The “cursed gift” of hearing unspoken star-words is conceptually rich but under-exploited for internal conflict within the scene. The closing shift to quiet and resolve is earned but emotionally neat given the depth of prior blockage implied.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The freight guard’s motives are clear and specific—his dreamlessness and commitment to “cultivate the sparks” give him a distinctive psychological profile. His actions consistently align with that purpose (learning to charm the archive, selecting and nurturing the seedling). What’s missing at this level is on-page internal conflict or contradiction; he rarely wavers or pays a visible emotional price beyond implied loneliness. The endurance of his dreamless state functions as a quiet cost, but it isn’t fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elian has a coherent desire (to understand their translocations and consciousness) and takes a few clear actions (following the hum, arranging the seven trees, choosing deliberate translocation), but they remain more emblematic than fully individuated. Interiority skews toward generalized philosophizing rather than idiosyncratic, embodied emotion, so pressure never quite personalizes. The early terror at waking elsewhere is summarized instead of dramatized, softening the sense of cost. Name drift to “Elias” and “Elliot” near the end undercuts character solidity at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The traveler remains more emblematic than individuated—no name, almost no interiority beyond “understanding beginning to crystallize.” Marek and Elara function as archetypal psychopomp figures with consistent but flat traits. Motivation (to find unused courage after the leash breaks) is clear but never really complicated by contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The final transformation reads more as an expected step in a ritual than as a hard-won, character-specific decision.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bellhop’s motivation—to understand the cost of safety and his own enforced silence—is clear and consistent, and his investigative choices follow from it. His sensory acuity and constrained role give him a distinct interiority, with nice touches like focusing on the piano’s “unpardonable silence.” However, his internal conflict at the climax (keep the ledger, expose it, flee, or comply) is underdeveloped; his decision to replace and relock the ledger feels more asserted than struggled through. The earned-stasis ending works, but could hit harder with more visible ambivalence or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his final act grows logically from his long, patient campaign. However, he is more emblematic than psychologically deep: we get scant interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. His “regally unpretentious” stance is shown, but we rarely feel genuine strain or doubt as he endures epochs alone. The pretender is effectively sketched as hollow arrogance but remains one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief, ritualized tapping, and history as a coral bleaching witness give him a clear, particular psychology. His motivation—to understand disappearing paths—feels organic and consistent with that history. However, his internal conflict is relatively undramatized; the shift from numb witness to hopeful participant happens smoothly, with little on-page struggle or contradiction. The ending change feels earned but low-cost for an elite-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stargazer’s motivation—adrift in a stalled rebellion and seeking meaning—is clear and consistent, and her choice to engage with the stone circle to reorient herself feels earned. Interiority is specific enough (bare feet, opera glasses, sensory attention) to avoid genericness. However, internal conflict is fairly one-directional: doubt → clarity, with little on-page push-pull or real ambivalence. The final steadiness lands, but without a strongly felt cost or contradiction being confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maeva’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—an aging insurgent committed to evolving tradition—and her choices directly track that drive. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or conflicting impulse; once she understands the kite’s message, her path feels straightforward. Emotional embodiment is present but relatively general (resolve, curiosity, quiet rebellion) rather than sharply particularized to her history or age. The final act feels earned but low-cost, limiting depth of internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s characterization is rich, specific, and embodied—her trauma responses, gardening competence, and the final choice to frame the photo all feel earned and internally consistent. The link between her past as a henna artist and current work with plants is especially strong. However, her interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-inflected abstraction (“somatic markers of trauma,” “integrating”) that slightly flattens contradiction in favor of articulated insight. The final stance leans a bit tidy, with less visible ongoing mess than her history would plausibly sustain.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    The artist’s emotional state and desire to rebuild are clear and consistent, and the shift from crestfallen to creator reads as a genuine internal turn. However, his interiority leans on generalized language (“fractured reality,” “tapestry of what-ifs”) rather than idiosyncratic, character-particular thought. We get little sense of specific history or concrete losses beyond the symbolic tarot box, which blunts the cost of his change. The arc is coherent but not deeply individualized or psychologically thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—his obsession with time in crisis drives every action, from deploying the drone to reading the ink. The “serene anger” is specific and embodied in small ways, like his measured movements and faint, reluctant smiles. However, interior conflict is relatively mild; he rarely wavers or faces a true dilemma that forces a visible trade-off. The final shift (anger “reshaped”) feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (spreading destabilizing truths) is clear and consistent, and we get embodied stress (“paper crinkling,” “breath hitched”), but her interiority leans on generalized formulations like “bravely conflicted soul” rather than specific, character-particular contradictions. Her choice to upload the letter and then flee is believable yet largely untested on the page, with little struggle between competing impulses beyond assertion. The closing sense of peace comes quickly given the enormity of what she’s done, softening the cost of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s pacifist vocation against her father’s violent trade is clear, specific, and grounded in tactile habits (sandbag scrap, velvet-sheathed knife, plant-whispering). Her motivation—to create beauty and peace after destruction—is well articulated and consistent. However, internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see contradictory impulses in live decision under pressure, only a settled stance. The ending offers endurance rather than a new, visibly costly choice, which slightly flattens her arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fisher’s motivation (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear, consistent, and tightly tied to his temperament and method, and his calm vs. raw-souled longing is sketched with specificity. However, internal contradiction under pressure is lightly handled; we’re told his soul is raw more than we see simultaneous conflicting impulses alter his choices in scene. His final state—satisfied yet marked—is credible and earned, but the cost remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her need to understand her parents’ deaths and to live up to her father’s investigative ethos drives every choice. Her “devotedly observant” nature is credibly dramatized in the desk search and in how she reads objects as evidence. However, her emotional experience skews cerebral and composed; there’s little visceral grief, fear, or genuine doubt under pressure, which flattens internal conflict. The final resolve to “write a new story” feels earned but low-cost, with minimal ambivalence or flaw confronting her.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orion’s guilt, tenderness, and professional competence are clearly motivated and cohere across the piece, with the late reveal about his daughter recontextualizing his work in a satisfying way. His micro-choices—buying the amber on impulse, deciding to tether this guilt into tomorrow’s client—track logically and show a credible inner life. However, the internal conflict is largely explained rather than dramatized in scene (e.g., we’re told the guilt has soured the equipment rather than feeling it through more embodied struggle). The final shift toward peace is earned but a touch tidy, with limited depiction of contradictory impulses at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to find meaning amid the unlearning and the emergent hush—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in taking and using the tile flake. Interiority is particular enough (chalk pastels, sand mandalas, sensitivity to sound) to feel individual rather than generic. However, she lacks real internal contradiction or moral tension; she wants something, pursues it, and largely gets it without visible ambivalence or cost. The final realization about the unlearning lands as slightly tidy rather than emerging from a deeply conflicted inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core contradiction—“gentle radical,” empathy in “arms of steel,” retrocognitive curse—feels specific and coherent, and her choice to rename the Lion of Judgment is clearly motivated. However, her emotional life leans abstract (“her mind looping back to the fire”) rather than being fully grounded in embodied, moment-to-moment reaction. Internal conflict is more told than dramatized; we’re informed of her torment and resolve but rarely see impulses in direct collision on the page. The final endurance choice (to keep renaming stones) is credible but could carry more sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arthur’s motivation (encore-seeking, then protecting the theater) is clear and consistent, and his interiority—synesthetic perceptions, weariness with repetition—feels specific. However, he encounters little real resistance or dilemma once the coin appears; his shift from encore-addict to guardian is moving but too smooth to feel fully hard-won. Internal contradiction (clinging to applause vs. letting go) is implied more than dramatized in on-page choices. The lack of another on-page character also limits relational pressure that might deepen his complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear from the outset—she wants to survive and make sense of the unwanted telepathy—and every choice in the scene (designing the light-painting method, enduring the session) aligns with that drive. Interiority is concrete and particular (somatic markers, physical exhaustion), and her shift from “victim” to “cartographer of the soul” feels earned by the work she undertakes. The affectionate skeptic trait appears explicitly and coheres with her solution being methodological rather than mystical. Internal contradiction is present but relatively mild; she adapts quickly, so there’s less messiness or self-sabotage than a top-tier score would require.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s vocation, sensory experience, and longing for purpose are vivid and specific, and her realization that she is a “conduit” follows plausibly from what happens. However, she faces almost no resistance—internal or external—and contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire, skepticism vs. hope) never meaningfully complicate her choices. The emotional progression is mostly linear: doubt → revelation → confidence, with minimal cost to her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear, and the tactile engagement with the buttons gives her some lived specificity, but her inner life remains largely unconflicted and smooth. The shift from believing in a fixed prophecy to embracing choice happens without much on-page doubt, resistance, or mistake. Emotional beats lean on summary (“quiet yet profound,” “her heart light”) more than idiosyncratic contradiction under pressure. The ending renunciation of fatalism is conceptually earned but feels too easy for the stakes invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives—penance, protecting Althea, “fixing what's broken”—are clear, stable, and drive all his choices. Interiority is specific enough (Prague, the fire, the training in the Carpathians) to individualize him, and his final renunciation is earned. However, his inner conflict is relatively one-directional; we don’t feel a live tug-of-war between self-preservation and sacrifice in the present moment. The emotional register occasionally drifts into abstract phrasing instead of fully embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coachman’s motivation (honoring a layered promise to his brother) is clear, consistent, and ties cleanly to his actions and final shift. Interiority is present and particular—his attention to sounds, the needle as grounding object—but remains somewhat generalized emotionally; we don’t feel much real ambivalence or resistance. The cloaked figure/brother is more emblematic than individuated, so the relationship never quite becomes a crucible under pressure. The final lightening of his heart is earned but feels gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand the anomaly rather than fix it—is clear, consistent, and rooted in his temperament as a patient, contemplative maker. His interiority is specific (“phototropic to kindness”) and his methodical choices (marking shadows, using smoke, offering calm instead of force) feel character-driven. What’s thinner is internal contradiction; he moves with serene rightness throughout, with little visible doubt or friction that might deepen his humanity. The final acceptance of loss (releasing the preserved moment) is earned but emotionally underplayed given the scale of what changes.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gardener’s motivation is clear, consistent, and tied well to his habits and tools, and his quiet sensitivity is convincingly rendered. However, he experiences little genuine inner conflict or contradictory impulse—he’s steady, competent, and self-effacing throughout. Emotional states are more described than embodied at key beats, and secondary characters remain purely symbolic presences. The final “change” is more communal than personal, so his own arc feels like a gentle continuation rather than an earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation (to transform isolation into independence) is clear and consistent, and her final decision to become a guardian of memory is logically rooted in what precedes it. However, her interiority leans abstract and declarative (“independence didn’t mean alone-ness, but self-reliance”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. Emotional conflict—grief vs. hope, self-pity vs. responsibility—is more summarized than dramatized. The change at the end feels earned conceptually but not fully embodied through specific, pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—finding the connecting thread—is clear and consistent, and his interiority is distinct (seeing the nest as “a map, a sigil”). The shift from burdened keeper of secrets to participant in the tapestry feels earned by the accumulated sensory and emotional pressure in the installation. However, his internal conflict is relatively smooth; contradictory impulses (doubt vs. belief, fear vs. desire) are implied more than dramatized. A touch more friction or embodied hesitation at key beats would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s professional competence and ethical drive are clear and consistent, and her motivation to protect humanity from manipulation is well rooted in her role. However, her emotional life is mostly summarized rather than embodied; we’re told she’s isolated and hopeful more than we feel those states in specific, pressured moments. Internal contradiction is light—she never seriously wavers between career risk and moral duty. The final “cautiously hopeful” stance is credible but comes without a strongly dramatized internal cost.

    The explorer’s core contradiction—crippling claustrophobia versus chosen duty to enter the nexus—is clear and motivates her presence and choices. We get some embodied stress (breathing, hammering heart, urge to flee) alongside competence and calculation, which gives her texture beyond a stock “chosen one.” However, her success feels relatively untroubled by real mistakes or hesitation, so flaws never materially endanger the mission. The post-victory psychological shift is more asserted than dramatized, softening the felt cost of her internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and rooted in his face blindness and ritualistic approach, and his choice to keep working and then leave the drawing at the museum feels coherent with that psychology. However, his internal conflict is relatively thin: there’s little on-page contradiction or real temptation to give up, which flattens what could be a sharper crucible. Emotional states are mostly implied through action and image rather than deeply embodied, which works tonally but keeps us at a slight distance. The final endurance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motives (honor the ancestor, escape exile, understand the station) are clear and consistent, and his final choice to accept the burden rather than expose the phenomenon is credibly rooted in those motives. The internal conflict between curiosity and respect for the ancestor’s silence is present but somewhat under-dramatized; we’re told his dread and resolve more than we feel them in embodied, character-specific ways. Repetitions like “nervously confident” do some work but also feel like labels rather than fresh emotional texture. The cost of his final stance—carrying a secret and responsibility—could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara has a clear role, voice, and motivation shift (from busker to custodian of “thin places”), and her observational trait is at least notionally tied to her actions. However, most of her arc is summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told her motivation deepens and that she “knew better,” but we rarely see her in concrete, high-pressure choices with visible cost. Internal conflict is muted—she accepts the uncanny relatively smoothly, with little simultaneous doubt/longing on the page. The final stance (embracing her bridge role) is emotionally plausible but not hard-earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jasper’s motivations (to understand cycles, to redirect his inheritance, to avoid his father’s literal path) are coherent and inform his major choices, and the relationship to his father’s “language of the road” gives him specificity. However, most key beats (investing in Elena, leaving the board meeting) are summarized rather than dramatized, so we rarely see him under acute on-page pressure making contradictory, costly choices. Elena has enough texture to avoid caricature, but her moral slide is sketched more as thesis than lived struggle. The final realization about habits vs. destiny is earned conceptually, but it lands more as articulated wisdom than as a viscerally hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara and Whitmore are clearly motivated—she by intellectual anxiety and duty, he by grief and protectiveness—but their inner conflict is gentle and rarely contradictory in-scene. Her “healing with words” gift is mostly told rather than deeply dramatized, though his posture softening is a nice concrete touch. The relationship does shift credibly from guarded mentor–student to collaborators sharing a burden. The emotional arc is coherent and earned, but not especially complex or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The druid’s guardedness, guilt, and desire to “discover what mirrors don’t show” give him a coherent, specific interiority. His fear vs compulsion to enter the vortex reads credibly, and the choice to step in is motivated by accumulated self-reproach. However, the emotional turn borders on tidy (“he had loved and lost, and the guilt had frozen him in place”) and leans on summary over dramatized contradiction in the peak beat. The arc is strong but not yet textured enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and textured—“anxious elation, a buoyant dread” is embodied and recurs meaningfully, and his root-bound lineage and scar give him credible motive to attempt a costly, intimate ritual. Internal contradiction (terror vs. compulsion, visionary vs. provincial) is present but under-exploited; he rarely wavers in ways that change tactics. His realization about the covenant’s true problem (“because it was lonely”) feels earned enough but slightly too neat conceptually. The closing shift from anxiety to grounded purpose reads as a believable, if somewhat smooth, evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to repair a past failure and “trammel fate”—is clear, consistent, and embodied in his careful, reverent behavior in the catacombs. His “reckless idealist” nature is shown through his willingness to barter his own destiny, not just told. However, there is almost no active internal contradiction or serious hesitation once the ritual begins, which flattens potential complexity. The final sense of peace feels earned but somewhat easy because his flaw is not meaningfully tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo’s interiority is specific, embodied, and rooted in his particular history with sound (“giant, broken drums,” “ghost of the noise he once loved”), and his final choice to pocket the cloth and leave the inventory unfinished is well-motivated. His flaw—hiding in technical perfection and devaluing the “after”—is clear and credibly confronted. The main limitation is that his inner conflict is articulated a bit too cleanly in abstract language (“He had been so focused on the technical perfection, the *before*, that he’d forgotten...”), which slightly flattens ambiguity around his realization. Still, the change from numbed appraiser to someone willing to re-engage with meaning in “broken things” feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maris’s grief, scholarly mindset, and inherited duty from Hamid are clearly motivated and consistent, and her analogical translator-physicist identity feels particular. However, her internal conflict is minimal: she moves from sorrow to understanding with little on-page resistance or contradiction. The choice to plant the seed never feels risky or contested, so the “cost” of her shift is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. This keeps the arc emotionally credible but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian’s interiority is distinctive—the migrating identities, the long history, the philosophical stance toward contradiction all feel specific. However, there is very little on-page pressure testing those traits; the ritual proceeds smoothly, so we don’t see contradictory impulses clash in a live decision. Motivation (“preserved wonder in routine”) is clear but largely asserted rather than dramatized through a difficult choice. The identity shift to Elara is interesting but not meaningfully contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, solitude, and buried longing for connection are clearly established and linked to his choices with the pearl and seashell ritual. His inner life, however, leans on abstracted formulations (“abandoned hopes,” “walls between hearts”) more than concrete, character-particular detail. The shift from isolated inspector to community midwife feels emotionally plausible but a bit too smooth, with little dramatized resistance or cost. Strong, coherent characterization, but the arc could use sharper contradictions and a more felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn—ink-stained, methodical, grief-saturated—and his history with the river and the bellows gives him particularity. His motivation (seeking self-forgiveness) is consistent and plausibly drives each action. Internal conflict is present (need for clarity vs. fear and guilt) but edges toward neatness rather than messy contradiction. The final renunciation (throwing the bellows) is earned, though the emotional transition is slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to find, explore, and document the library—but her interior life remains archetypal rather than individuated. Emotional states are mostly conveyed in conceptual language (“realization,” “understood then”) rather than embodied contradiction or stress. Her final insight is plausible yet arrives more as thesis than as the culmination of dramatized inner conflict. The cost of her choice (losing the library for now) is noted but not deeply felt through her particular psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clementine’s motivations (curiosity, ethical resistance to imperial appropriation, longing for “dream” over “empire”) are clear and consistent, and her professional and psychic competencies feel specific. The internal conflict—duty vs. desire—is stated rather than deeply dramatized in action, so the final choice reads slightly pre-decided rather than hard-won. Emotional texture leans conceptual (“mulberry ache,” “ache of what might have been”) more than bodily, which keeps her at a mild remove. Still, her final renunciation of the empire in favor of her own path is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Her vocation and purpose are clear and consistent, and the professional interiority around listening to “static” reads specific rather than generic. However, she is almost entirely defined by serene competence; there’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost, so we don’t see her under genuine pressure. The final reaffirmation of purpose feels earned but not hard-won. This keeps the characterization from reaching truly memorable depth.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The caretaker’s motivation—to find contentment after forgiving an old failure—is clear and consistent, and her rituals (climbing, handling the hairpin, tending the pool) reveal her values. However, most of the conflict is retrospective; the “unforgivable” act and its struggle are off-page, so we see the aftermath rather than her under live pressure. Her realization about contentment feels a bit tidy and declarative rather than emerging from visible contradictory impulses in the moment. Still, she reads as a distinct, coherent person shaped by long service and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s characterization as a “conscience for hire” with a perpetual “cloak of doubt” is specific and internally coherent, and his final reframing of that doubt feels earned by the preceding setup. Lyra’s “sincerely insincere” presentation and her later genuine gratitude trace a clear, credible emotional progression. The relationship dynamic—her guarded performance versus his professional, doubt-laden restraint—acts as an effective crucible for both characters. The only limitation is that their flaws aren’t tested under real resistance; everything goes a bit smoothly, limiting the felt cost of change.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael and Elara are clearly motivated (teach vs. learn), and their relationship is legible with a nice touch in the backwards-aging detail, though that trait doesn’t affect his choices. Elara’s inner progression from confusion to insight feels earned through attention to the ripples, but her emotional life remains fairly singularly focused on comprehension rather than torn by real ambivalence. There’s limited contradictory impulse or visible cost in her success, which keeps the arc somewhat tidy. Still, the master–apprentice dynamic is specific enough to feel alive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular—his fixation on “navigation without moving” and his reverence for bone and dust feel individuated rather than generic. Interiority is sensorial and grounded in vocation (harmonic skimmer) rather than label-speak. The main limitation is the relative absence of on-page contradictory impulses or a visibly costly renunciation; his shift reads as deepening of a long-held stance more than a pressured, ambivalent choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and specific—he wants “magic with soul” in an automated world—and his years-long quest plus the risk of the ascent feel consistent with that drive. However, his interiority tends to affirm a single stance rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses (fear vs faith, resentment vs reverence) in the moment of risk. The “underachieving mage” label is more told than shown; we don’t see him fail or doubt in scene. His change at the end is credible but somewhat summarized rather than emerging through a sharply pressured internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orion’s motivation—fulfilling a “luminous vow” tied to his brother and discovering the color of sound—is clear and consistent, and his ritualistic competence reads persuasively. However, he experiences little on-page internal contradiction or genuine struggle; the dive and ritual unfold without any meaningful self-doubt, fear, or competing desire. The “hides behind truth” trait is stated rather than dramatized, missing a chance to complicate his choices. The final shift in perception feels earned in terms of setup but not hard-won emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear—she’s the final decision maker encoding a warning or blessing—but her interiority leans conceptual rather than embodied, keeping her slightly abstract. The “stellar doubt” versus “quietly enthusiastic” tension is promising yet under-exploited; her doubt dissolves quickly into purpose with little on-page struggle or visible cost. Micro-choices (arranging coins, listening to static) express her nature but rarely feel pressured or morally fraught. The final alignment reads earned enough conceptually, but not deeply contested emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper’s grief, guilt, and duty are clearly motivated and embodied through concrete ritual (handling the atlas, speaking names), and his final choice to leave the monsters behind reads as an earned shift rather than a flip. Interiority is specific enough to feel character-particular—his fixation on stars, light, and duty—as opposed to generic “sad reaper” angst. There is some emotional tidiness (“his heart no longer broken, but scarred—tougher, softer, human”) that edges toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction at the end. Still, the internal arc from repression to a fragile acceptance is coherent, with visible cost in the act of naming.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s characterization as a “lukewarm” mage with “brittle” yet stubborn devotion is specific and consistent, and his micro-choices (using a nearly ridiculous method, persisting despite clear limits) feel motivated by that mix of doubt and hope. Interiority is concrete enough—he measures himself against grander mages, feels his magic “lukewarm,” and experiences real disappointment when the bell heals but the world does not. However, his internal conflict is relatively straightforward (self-doubt vs. hope) without a sharper contradictory impulse brought to a true pinch point. The final renewal of hope is credible but emotionally modest, limiting the sense of a deeply earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The warden’s vocation, burden of memory, and self-assigned mission are coherent and specific, and details like the salvaged flask and the ritual with photographs individualize him. The internal contradiction between “expunging” the past and actively curating it via story is interesting but under-dramatized in scene. Emotional texture is mostly inferred from atmosphere rather than from sharply conflicted impulses on the page. His final stance feels like a gentle reaffirmation rather than a pressured, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—harmonizing logic and intuition—is clear, consistent, and deeply embedded in how she works, from obsessive journals to bird-based measurements. We get a distinct sense of her temperament (rigorous, reverent, slightly secretive) and history. However, internal conflict in the present scene is minimal; she is not visibly torn or pressured into any difficult trade-off. The “final transformation” reads as a calm culmination rather than a choice with on-page cost, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The seeker’s motivations (pattern-seeking, preserving trust, honoring the lost jumper via the buckle) are clear and consistently dramatized through ritual and embodied detail. Interiority is specific—“their fingers tracing the bark as though reading braille,” “motions were prayers”—and not generic. Internal conflict between doubt (are the patterns real?) and duty (trusting the invisible) is present but remains somewhat abstract, with no concrete relationship or named counterpart tying the voice on the radio to a specific cost. The final easing of the “watcher’s burden” feels earned, but the personal stakes of that burden could be more sharply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—proving he’s the true survivor and escaping numbness—is clear and consistently drives his choices, especially his decision to vivify the brain rather than just fight the clone. Interiority feels mostly embodied (“heart rattled against his ribs,” numbness as “old ice”) and not just labeled. The internal conflict between wanting anesthesia and needing to feel is present but could be sharpened into more simultaneous, contradictory impulses in pivotal beats. The relationship with the clone as a mirrored self under pressure is strong, though the clone stays somewhat one-note emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a logic-driven puzzle maker whose curiosity and protectiveness toward “innovation” feel specific and consistent. His actions (testing the seed, then choosing to let it be) track cleanly with that characterization. Internal conflict is present but mild—there’s not much in the way of contradictory impulses beyond method vs. acceptance. The final stance (protecting the question) is earned but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief and “mournfully eager” drive are concrete and specific, with motives that cleanly power every on-page choice. Bodily strain (burning arm, slick pull cord) grounds his emotion. Internal contradiction (despair vs. hope) is present but could be pushed into one sharper, riskier doubt or temptation mid-ritual. The final sense of earned comfort is credible, though slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sylvan’s motivation—“to make friends with uncertainty”—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted, and his interiority feels particular (dimensional homesickness, the ache as a “phantom limb”). The internal conflict between his foggy lucidity and the pendant’s sharp certainty is well dramatized in his urge to shatter it versus his chosen stillness. The final stance shift from mere guardian to inhabitant is earned by prior beats of acceptance and interiorization. Emotional embodiment skews abstract rather than somatic at times, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s desire to break out of a preordained, humiliating destiny is clear and consistent, and his final internal shift feels earned by the thirteen years of failure and the successive approximations in this scene. However, his psychology is delivered mostly in abstract, thematic language rather than concrete, character-particular contradictions in action, so he reads more like an embodiment of an idea than a fully idiosyncratic person. The most vivid, specific touch is his trembling, “stoically sensitive” hands, but the piece rarely builds on that kind of embodied detail. The cost of his choice (beyond symbolically destroying the crozier) is underplayed, which slightly flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated, with a coherent inner life centered on listening and reinterpretation, and his micro-choices (using the fragment, discarding assumptions) align with that. However, his emotional texture is relatively smooth and contradiction-light—he never feels genuinely torn, threatened, or at risk of failing his task. The final “lesson” he draws is credible but comes easily, without much dramatized struggle. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet at a truly elite, pressure-tested level.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elijah is clearly motivated, competent, and likable, with a strong professional pride and a secret mission that fits his role. However, he experiences almost no on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his "resiliently positive" outlook never meaningfully clashes with doubt or fear. The mission's risk (“threatened to tear the grotto apart”) barely registers emotionally in him, blunting depth. As a result, he reads more as a well-drawn functionary than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Siran’s motive (discovering the “texture of connection” and making illusions permanent) is clear and consistently dramatized through his trial-and-error with the thread. The tension between precision/control and letting memories “breathe” gives him a real internal conflict. Interiority is specific enough to feel individual, though his final realization lands a bit neatly, with limited messiness or lingering contradiction. More embodied, idiosyncratic emotional detail would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias has a clear role and motivation, and his attachment to the chain link plus his volunteerism for the star project give him some specificity. However, he never experiences real internal conflict; everything he does feels aligned and untested. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, so we don't feel a cost to his choices. The students are largely a single, admiring blur with no crucible relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s core traits—curiosity, compassion, competence—are clear and consistent, and her profession-specific mindset gives her some individuality. However, she faces almost no real internal conflict or cost; she is never truly torn between options or values. Her “persistently curious nature” is stated rather than deeply dramatized through contradictory impulses. The result is a likable but relatively low-pressure interiority that doesn’t fully earn the weight of the closing gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eliza’s motivations (mentor’s legacy, need for answers, eventual acceptance of a guardian role) are clear and mostly consistent, and the claustrophobia vs. freedom inversion is a promising contradiction. However, her internal conflict around the final, irreversible choice to dissolve is under-dramatized; she seems almost pre-disposed rather than pressured into it. Emotion is largely conceptualized rather than strongly embodied. The closing shift into “this is where she belongs” feels slightly too smooth for the existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt motive and quiet tenderness toward Aris are clear and consistent, and the heartbeat-counting gives him a concrete, character-specific tic. However, his internal conflict remains low-contrast: he never seriously resists or questions the ritual, so change at the end feels more like gentle affirmation than a pressured choice. Aris reads more as a steady, wise presence than a flawed consciousness wrestling with her own error, which smooths away potential sharpness. The final beat (“And infinite for you, my friend.”) lands emotionally but with limited sense of cost or contradiction resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s vocation, temperament, and relationship to the “curse” are clearly and consistently motivated, and their micro-choices (returning to the canyon, trusting the dream-method, reinterpreting the diamond) all fit a patient, reverent intelligence. However, there is almost no true internal contradiction or emotional struggle under pressure; they arrive already predisposed to the conclusion the story grants them. The realization that the diamond is a gift rather than a curse lands, but with limited felt cost or self-risk. This keeps the characterization from feeling as deep or volatile as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s goal, grief, and skewed desire “to turn his own bitterness…into a cosmic joke” are clear and character-specific, and his embodied reactions (rage fizzing, arrowhead biting his palm) feel lived. The internal conflict between his need to study/control and the Jester’s destabilizing influence is strong but resolves a bit quickly into the “wound to be tended” insight. Lyra’s reaction to the arrowhead hints at deep history yet arrives late and is only lightly sketched, so her choice to “stop running” lands more as a gesture than a fully earned crucible. The final renunciation (dropping the arrowhead) is motivated and forecloses a path, but the cost could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The violinist’s grief, numbness, and reawakening are clear and specific, and her choices (sneaking into the orchard, playing as defiance, refusing to flee, dropping the shell) track cleanly with that arc. Interiority is evocative but somewhat generalized; we don’t see many contradictory impulses in the peak beat, just a smooth pivot from grief to purpose. The “gap between knowing and understanding” motif gestures at deeper conflict but isn’t fully dramatized in moment-to-moment thought. Still, the final stance—choosing ongoing, costly work rather than a single catharsis—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation (his brother’s broken promise) is clear and threads cleanly into his present choices, and his “respectfully rebellious” stance is credibly enacted in the tactical omission. Interiority is specific enough to feel character-particular, not generic, especially in how he frames his work as delivering “hope” rather than mail. Internal conflict is quieter than it might be; his doubts or fears don’t significantly pull against his chosen course on the page, so the final endurance lands more as confirmation than a hard-won pivot. Still, the implied cost—risking war and his own position—gives his calm actions some weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s characterization as a mute, solitary restorer drawn to decay is vivid and coherent, and his motivation (salvage and a deeper pull toward silence-as-possibility) clearly drives his exploration. The choice to touch and then claim the halo fragment, culminating in singing, feels earned by the groundwork of his relationship to silence and craft. However, his internal resistance at the crucial moment is underplayed; the shift from lifelong silence to singing happens with relatively little dramatized ambivalence or fear. A touch more embodied contradiction in the lead-up to song would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian’s core motive (to find where stories live) is clear and consistently expressed, and her perceptions give her a distinct, mildly obsessive interiority. However, her emotional life is relatively thinly rendered—there’s little contradictory impulse or embodied stress as reality bends. Her “sanely eccentric” nature functions more as a label than an in-scene conflict driver. The closing change (becoming the library’s “heart”) feels more declared than earned via dramatized, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.5)
    The librarian’s motivation—to capture a runaway dream for the archipelago—is clear and consistent, and his odd-hour, secretive work gives him some specificity. However, his interiority stays largely archetypal; we don’t see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. Emotional beats are mostly narrated as serene purpose rather than struggle, so the final “beginning” feels granted rather than hard-won. The closure is an earned stance shift, but without visible personal cost or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith is vividly sketched—"unassumingly bold" with a specialized craft and calm ritual—but he faces little internal contradiction under pressure. His motivation to free the trapped idea is clear yet untested by doubt or temptation, so his arc feels more competent than transformed. The realization of "enough" is described as his insight, but we do not feel him wrestling his way toward it so much as executing a known procedure. As a result, the ending reads more like a completed service than a costly personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is specific and convincing as a hands-on, aging folklorist whose lifelong curiosity and missing childhood days motivate her return. Her emotional life is partly embodied (thermos steam, gravel under boots, sensory flashes of childhood), but internal conflict is relatively low-friction: she wants answers and then agrees to help with little on-page hesitation or visible cost. The merge of “chronically curious child” and “methodical researcher” is effective but tidy. A sharper clash between fear, skepticism, and desire—especially at the decision to help—would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is specific and coherent—her backward-walking tic, shard-mirror vocation, and “combative tenderness” all align with her drastic but caring choice to exile Marcus. Marcus is less dimensional but still registers as someone tempered rather than broken by the experience. Motivation is clear (protective mentorship via exile), but internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in an on-page dilemma. The final stance—acceptance of her method and its cost—feels earned but not deeply contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elianor’s motivation (preserving the Chroma Blossom/“color of wonder”) is clear and consistent, and her competence reads persuasively through embodied ritual action. However, she experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction; her certainty and serenity leave the arc more like a confirmation of who she already is than a tested change. Emotional beats are mostly implied through setting, with only a few direct touches (“heart swelling with a fierce, quiet joy”). The final endurance choice—to leave the seed to sun and river—carries minimal felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation and temperament are specific and well-motivated, and his steady focus under pressure fits the work he’s doing. However, his interior conflict is underdeveloped—he moves from competence to insight without much dramatized hesitation or contradiction. Anna functions mostly as an exposition channel; the relationship never truly becomes a crucible that forces a hard choice. The final realization about his hands feels earned but a bit tidy because we haven’t seen him significantly tempted to stay in the safer “mask” role.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation and professional identity, and his actions—setting up equipment, aligning footage, performing the ritual—are coherently rooted in his perceptiveness and patience. However, his emotional life stays relatively narrow: we get “heartbeat quickened” and guarded receptivity, but little in the way of contradictory impulses or real internal struggle. The final realization about his “purpose” is thematically apt but comes with limited on-page cost or hesitation. Overall, he reads vivid but somewhat untested rather than fully crucibled.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a quietly analytic obsessive, and Arthur/Death has a distinct, weary presence; their exchanges reveal character rather than just deliver exposition. His motivation to study “release” is consistently rooted in his temperament and history (the snow globe, the transmissions). The final choice to be “done here” feels earned, though his internal conflict could surface in more embodied, moment-to-moment contradiction rather than mostly as a late realization. The emotional cost of relinquishing his quest is present but could be shaded with one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The balladeer’s motivation—to give voice to the ghost and his own unspoken needs—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (continuing to work as the window closes, deciding when to retreat) align with that drive. However, he remains somewhat one-note: devoted, tranquil, and fulfilled, with limited contradiction or friction on the page. His emotional states are more often declared than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The “seldom-heard balladeer” aspect hints at a richer internal conflict but is only lightly dramatized in the final humming beat.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core traits (curiosity, longing for “joy beneath anguish”) are clear and consistent, and her small choices—picking up the goggles, testing them on the diary, continuing to read as the elevator climbs—logically drive the scene. However, we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or a pressured choice; her arc moves smoothly from ignorance to prepared acceptance without a visible struggle or cost. The sense that the diary’s author has been preparing her “from afar” flirts with an unearned specialness that isn’t dramatized through her earlier failings or conflicts. The final acceptance of legacy feels conceptually earned but emotionally under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is vivid as a specific kind of obsessive sky-watcher, and his grief for his father plus his quasi-scientific cataloguing give him texture. His core motivation—proving that absence has presence—is clear and consistently expressed. However, his emotional state is largely one-note (serene, ruminative) with little contradiction or real degradation under the obvious physical danger, so internal conflict feels underdeveloped. The final “understanding” lands more as confirmation of a belief he already holds than as a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motives (to “mirror the sky inside these walls,” to locate a purpose beyond faces) are clear and consistently tied to his sensory bias toward texture and light. His face blindness is well-integrated into perception and action, not just labeled. However, he meets little resistance and his transformation from portraitist to “keeper of light” reads a bit tidy and untroubled, with minimal contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to earn respect through a breakthrough—comes through clearly and aligns with his meticulous, curious behavior. His interiority is reasonably specific (the phrasebook, his solitary weeks, his love of murmurations) but rarely conflicted; there’s little genuine tension between ambition, fear, and wonder. The emotional change from “apprentice” to “keeper of stranded luminance” is asserted more than dramatized under pressure. A bit more embodied hesitation or risk around revealing/guarding the discovery would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and specific—she’s here “to learn the rhythm of repair” and implicitly to mend her own past—and her actions track consistently with that goal. The brief memory of her father under a lunar eclipse gives her a human anchor and some credible pain. However, the internal conflict is relatively low-friction; she rarely hesitates or struggles in a way that complicates her choices. The closing sense of wholeness feels a bit tidy and under-costed for the scale of transformation implied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.0)
    Characters function largely as roles within a fable-like overview rather than as individuated people with embodied, conflicting desires. Kael gets a specific action (reexamining logs) but no interior texture; Elara is mentioned but not actually dramatized as a focal presence. The Gardener’s motivation is clear but presented declaratively, not tested under pressure. The community’s shift from “survivors” to “caretakers” is thematically apt but emotionally underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The adjuster’s motivation—to preserve meaning with his lullaby rather than merely delay the end—is clear and consistent, and the puppet head anchors his interior life in a concrete way. However, he experiences almost no contradictory impulse or serious hesitation about defying his mandate, so the central choice lacks real inner struggle. His emotions are richly evoked but skew toward a single register of solemn reverence, which flattens complexity. The final stance feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tomas’s sense of reluctant duty, guilt, and competence is clear and specific, with nice embodied touches like hair tangled with leaves and the “morning sickness” residue of the curse. His motive—to mitigate the orchard’s harm—is consistently dramatized through micro-choices (assembling the device, calling to the traveler, enduring frost). Internal contradiction (resentful burden vs committed caretaker) is present but could be pressed harder under peak pressure. The traveler is purely functional, but that suits this length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivation and conflict between contractual duty and love for Marco are clear and specific, and her polymer-centric metaphors feel character-true. The atonement drive and her professional guilt build coherently toward the decision to create an alternative polymer. Internal states skew a bit abstract at times (“grief… like a polymer chain”) instead of fully embodied, but the emotional throughline still reads convincingly. The final metamorphosis in her relationship with Marco feels earned by prior interior movement.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias’s motive (“to find the place where stories begin”) is clear but mostly told, not dramatized in his on-page choices, which remain professionally detached. The two customers feel like types (hollow woman, trembling young man) with minimal interior contradiction or specificity. His line “Regret is just another story waiting to be bottled” hints at complexity but isn’t backed by visible inner conflict about his work. The ending settles into endurance rather than a felt change, with limited sense of cost to him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation—escaping the acute bitterness of his own memories by overwhelming them with stored remorse—is vivid and particular, and it cleanly drives every action. Interiority is strong and sensorially grounded (“taste memories,” “salt on his tongue”), giving him a real psychological texture. However, his internal conflict is under-tested: once he decides to go to the pavilion, there’s no serious moment of hesitation or competing impulse on the page. The final change in him feels earned but a bit too smooth, with limited sense of moral ambiguity or cost for absorbing so much suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motive—to reconnect isolated farming communities—is clear and consistent, and her occupational texture as a “harmonious choral librarian” feels particular. However, she remains almost entirely competent and unconflicted; there’s little evidence of contradictory impulses or emotional cost on the page. The brief mention of skeptical directors hints at pressure but never forces a difficult choice. As a result, the final sense of fulfillment reads more asserted than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core drive and worldview are vivid—“helix-minded engineer” and “archaeologist of abandoned dreams” feel particular and consistent—but she faces almost no opposing impulse or real-time doubt. Her emotions are largely conceptual rather than embodied, so the peak moments (“quaking reverie”) stay a bit abstract. The big life choice (leaving Neuro-Tech) is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens potential internal conflict. Her closing stance feels plausible but low-cost, more confirmation than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and core trait (prism-mind, hunger for “forgotten combinations”) are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the story, but she faces little real resistance and almost no contradictory impulses on the page. Emotions are more labeled than embodied (“latent blaze of purpose”) and we rarely see stress degrade her thinking or create mistakes. The final change—now bearing the seeds and committing to protect them—feels earned but low-cost, largely an extension of her existing purpose. A deeper internal conflict (doubt, fear, competing loyalties) would push this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—“to create music in a silent world” and to prove “broken things could sing” grounds every action. Her interiority is mostly shown through tactile, sensory engagement with the sculpture and grove rather than abstract labels. However, she encounters little genuine resistance or internal contradiction, so we see more competence and tenderness than actual struggle under pressure. The ending shift (her repricing of the world’s “silence”) feels earned but low-cost, limiting the depth of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand his exile and find beauty in it—is clear, consistent, and well-rooted in his chess-trained pattern seeking. His interiority feels particular (the worry stone, the board as metaphor), but his emotional journey moves smoothly toward acceptance with limited on-page contradiction or genuine struggle. The exile’s political nature is intriguing yet underdramatized in his present-tense conflict. The final shift to “translator of silence” is credible but a touch easy, with little sense of what darker impulses he’s refusing or repressing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    Silen is vivid, specific, and motivated, with clear quirks (mismatched socks, peace-symbol earrings, frequency-obsessed pacifism) that align with their goal of unlocking the diary. Interiority is present but leans abstract and declarative, often articulating philosophy more than dramatizing contradictory impulses under pressure. The core motive—to access past thoughts as a map to empathy—is coherent and carries through to the end. However, there’s little on-page internal conflict or visible cost to their choice, which flattens the arc into a graceful execution of a plan rather than a pressured character test.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clear, consistent, and particular—her olfactory gift, unconventional journal, and corpse-flower project feel integrated rather than labeled—but she lacks real contradiction under pressure. Her ambition for “serenity within motion” is well-motivated and paid off in the ending, yet she faces almost no internal friction or moral ambiguity. The relationship with Finn is gentle and believable, but it never truly becomes a crucible that forces harder choices. The final shift—reframing wisdom as process and community—is earned but low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation as an intrepid, scientifically driven pilot is clear and consistent, and her reactions to the artifact and the core tree align with that. However, she experiences little genuine internal conflict—curiosity and ambition are never meaningfully at odds with fear, ethics, or loyalty. Emotional states are more labeled than deeply embodied beyond a few gestures (tightening her fingers, adjusting her harness, smelling the air). Her end realization feels earned enough, but it doesn’t cost her anything tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias has a coherent professional psychology (accident investigator, ex–flight engineer, “rapidly adapting mind”) and a concrete emotional hook via the patch, but we rarely see him under true pressure making ambiguous choices. His fear, guilt, and curiosity are mostly told in summary rather than embodied, so internal contradiction stays conceptual. The final “reckoning” with his blind spot is thematically apt but comes as a clean realization rather than a contested, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The bell ringer’s core motivation (“to certify wonder as essential”) is clear and consistent, and their synesthetic perception gives them some individuality. However, they function more as an archetypal vessel than a psychologically complex person: there’s almost no internal contradiction, doubt, or visible cost. The emotional journey from “quiet fervor” to “synesthetic soul at peace” feels asserted rather than struggled for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Keeper’s motivation—to confront and learn from a specific past failure—is clear and consistently carried through the scene. Interiority is specific enough (the trembling at uncasing the flute, the burden of guardianship) but tilts toward conceptual language rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure. We do get a credible change at the end (from being haunted by failure to being transformed through it) that feels earned by the journey. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper, moment-to-moment conflict between impulses on the page, beyond summary of what they’ve realized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas is sharply etched: a collector of personalities who treats emotion as solvable math, and his shift from borrowed personae to earned empathy is motivated by long-standing obsession plus the halo’s pressure. The embodied detail of his borrowed voices (“adopting the crisp cadence…”, “matter-of-fact tone of the accountant”) gives him specificity beyond a concept vehicle. His final choice to dissolve the fragment into his chest clearly costs him his protective distance, even if the pain of that loss could be shaded more viscerally. The interior conflict—control vs surrender to feeling—could tighten further under peak stress, but it’s legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courier’s interiority is specific—his jitteriness, attachment to the pendant, and sense of inherited duty all read as grounded and character-particular. His change from anxious transporter to intentional “wonder-weaver” is legible and causally seeded. However, his internal conflict rarely manifests as simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure; it’s more narrated understanding than dramatized struggle. The emotional cost of accepting the mentor’s legacy is implied rather than felt sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained, and his interiority is textured (scholarly rigor versus acceptance that his “truth” is unverifiable). The embodied details—bare feet on stone, prism in hand, forehead to quartz—keep his emotional state grounded. Internal conflict is present but relatively gentle; we don’t see him truly torn or risking something concrete beyond his own certainty. The final shift into private conviction is earned but could carry sharper cost or contradiction to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive—reaching her stolen brother—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (searching the sale box, recommencing weaving, choosing to continue at the end) align with that drive. However, she remains mostly a single-note figure of steadfast longing; there’s little contradictory impulse or real internal argument on the page. Emotion is embodied decently (bleeding fingers, collapse), but her inner life feels more archetypal than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent from the first paragraph through the closing image, and his internal shift from “meek” to “purposefully transformed” is credibly earned. His quiet resolve, financial sacrifice, and solitary labor all align with his goal. However, internal conflict is muted—he rarely hesitates or doubts, so contradictory impulses barely show on the page, which softens the sense of cost and struggle. The closing self-recognition (“rubble within himself”) is thematically apt but slightly stated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s core motivation (uncovering the withheld truth and clearing the void in his past) is clear and consistently enacted, and his sensory-focused way of perceiving reality gives him some individuality. However, his emotional life skews abstract and declarative (“debt paid to himself,” “cartographer of his own soul”) rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses or genuine struggle in the moment. The younger self and engineer are functional but flat, serving more as plot devices than relational pressure. The final shift to acceptance is believable but a little too smooth, with minimal felt resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jonah’s motives (duty to the lamp, need for safety, wary hunger for connection) are clear and consistent, and his reticence is dramatized rather than just labeled. His small but real change—from guarded solitude to the vulnerable act of stacking the three stones—feels earned by the letter history. However, internal contradiction (fear of connection vs desire for it) is more described than placed under sharp on-page pressure. The emotional life is textured but could use one concrete moment where his reluctance genuinely risks failing his duty or message.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s vocation, worldview, and long-term motive are clear and specific, and his relationship to the wick and the storms feels individualized. However, his interiority remains largely stable and contemplative with limited contradictory impulses or on-page struggle, so the “change” at the end is more restated acceptance than earned shift. Emotional states are described more than embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to understand why some people magnetize stories in the wake of his transplant—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his sun-tracking ritual. His interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (the donor heart as “a question,” the wing as “iridescent caution”), and his final shift from investigation to devotion feels earned. Internal contradiction (resisting donor memories yet obsessing over their ‘quality of attention’) is present but could be pushed harder under pressure. With no other on-page characters, the single-POV focus is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation (to understand what trees witness) is clear and consistent, and their occupational detail as a maintenance worker gives them a specific, grounded lens. However, interior conflict is minimal: they are never truly torn between duties and research beyond a brief note that their schedule is “stretched thin.” Emotions tend to be summarized rather than embodied, so we don’t feel their stakes viscerally in key moments like the stormlit experiment. The final shift is more conceptual than character-costly, so the internal arc lands as modest rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    The keeper’s purpose, burden, and past failure are clearly motivated, and his actions (choosing to try again, sustaining the song) align with that drive. However, his interiority is mostly archetypal—“burden,” “purpose,” “scattered memories”—with limited contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment. The brief nod to a prior failed attempt hints at fear and doubt, but this conflict is summarized rather than enacted. He changes from burdened to lighter and more whole, but the emotional cost of that shift is more told than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivations and contradictions are clear and specific: her empathy drives both her retreat and her sense of duty, and the backstory of the failed therapeutic experiment grounds her avoidance. The internal conflict between isolation and obligation is credible and sustained. However, some of the interiority leans into abstract/therapeutic language (“collective consciousness pressing in,” “psychological boundaries”) rather than fully embodied feeling in the moment of decision. The final choice to attend is believable but feels somewhat thematically preordained rather than pressured into messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is distinct, sensorially grounded, and her motives (absolution, sacred-in-the-ordinary, holding onto the bakery through bread) cohere cleanly with her actions. The old man is sketched efficiently with a credible weariness, though his inner life remains thin. Internal contradiction in Elara (guilt vs hope, noticing decay vs insisting on beauty) is present but not deeply dramatized under pressure. The final hopeful turn feels earned but slightly tidy, with limited sense of ongoing cost or unresolved flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear—she’s meticulous, dutiful, driven to preserve meaning—but her interiority remains fairly one-note and almost entirely in alignment with her task. We rarely see contradictory impulses or real emotional cost beyond a vague exhaustion, so she reads more as a function of the premise than a fully pressured person. Her “gently meticulous nature” is stated and reinforced but not meaningfully challenged. The ending doesn’t mark a clear internal shift so much as a completion of expected duty.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Emmie’s motivation (protecting the community and avenging her father) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her persistence across three attempts tracks well with the “steadfast” trait. We get some embodied emotion (clutching the watch fob, feeling the “comforting unease”), but her interior conflict—justice vs. preserving the community—is more told than deeply dramatized. Silas remains a functional antagonist rather than a fully realized person, with his off-page meetings limiting the relationship pressure. The final decision to preserve the truce is believable but could land harder if her ambivalence and cost were more viscerally felt earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara reads as a distinct, embodied consciousness with concrete quirks (tasting atmospheric shifts, her blue glow, the skeptical posture), and her motive—finding other weather-carriers and understanding herself—is legible. Her shift from skepticism to acceptance is motivated by the encounter and the sensory intensification, but the turn happens smoothly, with little visible resistance or cost on the page. The man functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully pressured counterpart, so their relationship never really becomes a crucible. The result is a well-drawn protagonist with a slightly under-dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s shame, self-exile, and longing to create again are clear and coherent, and his choice to reclaim art at the end is well motivated by what precedes it. Internal conflict between fear of mockery and the compulsion to draw is present but could be sharpened into more moment-by-moment contradiction rather than summarized feeling. His mnemonic gift and charcoal-stained hands give some individuality, though he still reads more as an archetype than a fully particular person. The cost of years of withdrawal is acknowledged but remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her skin’s wilting as a truth-meter is both a vivid image and a character-defining constraint. Her drive to uncover what’s been silenced, and her mixture of hurt and integrity in the confrontation with Marius, feel motivated and consistent. The relationship with Marius gives us a real crucible, shifting from trust to betrayal to uneasy alliance. The one limitation is that we don’t see much contradictory impulse in her at the peak—she moves fairly cleanly from discovery to moral resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    The tuner’s core motive—to preserve “the color of wonder”—is clear and consistent, and his actions (arranging the fragment, adjusting the lever, choosing to leave) align with it. However, he remains more emblematic than individuated; we get little in the way of contradiction, blind spots, or embodied emotional complexity. His seasonally mute condition is conceptually rich but never forces a difficult choice or visibly costs him something on the page. The final “brighter” smile hints at endurance, but the change is small and not sharply earned through internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    L-734’s motivation and arc are clear and consistent—resolve the inner static by confronting the box, compressing fear, and risking the controlled burn. Interiority is vivid but sometimes leans on abstract phrasing (“fragmented wholeness”) more than concrete, character-specific contradiction. The key choice at the burn feels earned but lightly costed; there’s little sense of risk-of-failure beyond conceptual stakes. Still, the transformation from captive caretaker to self-directed entity is legible and grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s core traits (curator of stories, motivated listener) are clear and consistent, and his choice to take up Mrs. Leclair’s work is causally earned. However, his interiority stays largely in noble, unconflicted territory; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt. Mrs. Leclair remains an idealized offstage figure rather than a person with edges. The final vow reads more as fulfillment of an intended archetype than as a hard-won, psychologically messy shift.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal and competence are clear and consistent, and her habits (journal, dice, dance) give her some individuality. However, her interiority stays fairly generic—“her heart raced” versus the cultivated calm—without a sharper contradiction or morally fraught choice under pressure. The bond with the mentor is told rather than deeply felt, so his liberation lands more conceptually than emotionally. The guards function more as scenery than as relational or psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motive—to reclaim erased memories and understand the gravity anomalies—is clear, consistent, and drives each major action (studying grounds, breaking into the institute, performing the ritual). Interiority is present and occasionally vivid (“a tear slipped down her cheek”), but we rarely see true internal contradiction or hesitation; she is almost uniformly resolute. Her professional identity as a lantern lighter adds texture but doesn’t significantly complicate her emotional calculus. The final endurance/return to routine with new knowledge is earned, but the cost feels relatively low-stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    The summoner’s motivation (to neutralize the prophecy) is clear and consistent, and his ritual actions align with that goal, but his interiority remains generalized and archetypal rather than sharply individual. We’re told he “had spent years mapping silence,” yet we rarely feel the cost or texture of that history in a concrete, character-specific way. There is little sense of internal contradiction or doubt during the ritual—his “mind a tranquil blaze” flattens complexity instead of revealing it. The ending choice to claim the silence as peace is therefore conceptually earned but not deeply dramatized as a personal, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tutor and Elias are both clearly sketched, with distinct roles (seer vs skeptic) and a lived-in rapport, and her secrecy versus his curiosity is credibly motivated. Her emotional life, however, stays relatively narrow—some anxiety, some relief—without much contradictory impulse under pressure. The final shift from lying to open listening feels right but comes cheaply, with little felt cost beyond mild vulnerability. Strong but not yet cutting or transformative characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation and arc from “charmed skeptic” to committed practitioner are clear, and her choices (building the grid, agreeing to “walk through them all”) feel earned by the presented psychology. The isolation/independence drive is well seeded and paid off. Internal conflict (fear of being overwhelmed vs. desire for integration) is present but largely asserted rather than deeply dramatized in messy, moment-to-moment hesitation. The ending transformation is credible, though a bit clean and untroubled for the weight of the material.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and grounded in history; her years of preparation and the focus on the ink and signature make her competence feel earned rather than convenient. The interior contradiction between revenge and “forgiving the unfinished” via justice is interesting, though it never quite bites hard enough to feel like a real, on-page dilemma. Emotional states are mostly embodied through the sanctuary, ink, and thorn rather than clinical labels, which works well. The change at the end—her felt lightness and willingness to move forward—tracks cleanly with what we’ve seen, but happens without a strong moment of active doubt or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s perceptual curse, vocation, and moral drive are clear and specific, and his decision to weaponize the canyon’s song reads motivated and consistent. However, he is largely defined by a single axis (sensitive truth-teller vs. corrupt power), with little on-page contradiction or ambivalence under pressure. Emotional embodiment leans more toward cosmic metaphor than felt, messy human reaction, which slightly flattens him at peak moments. The shift from haunted seeker to purposeful echo-bearer is present but not deeply costed in his interior life.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is vivid and particular—an aging wreck-diver with a specific, haunting vocation—but she rarely faces real internal contradiction on the page. Her motivation to “salvage something pure from the wreckage” is clear and consistent, yet her emotional responses skew toward summary rather than embodied conflict. The exhaustion after helping Nikolaus hints at cost but doesn’t deepen into a hard choice or moral ambiguity. Strongly conceived, but missing that next layer of messy, pressured interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s vocation and philosophical bent are specific and consistently tied to her choices, especially her decision to follow the fireflies and her response to the loom. However, her inner life is mostly aligned rather than conflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk in pursuing the moon paths. The final shift (greater appreciation of hidden patterns) is credible but arrives with minimal resistance or cost. A touch more contradiction or fear would deepen her beyond “contemplative seeker who gets what she wants.”

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s professional stance and observational competence are clear and consistent, and her shift from debunker to excavator of truth is legible. However, her inner life is mostly asserted rather than embodied—little sensory or conflicting emotion undercuts the weight of her final realization. The “sharply observant” trait is used functionally but not to reveal deeper contradiction or cost. The arc lands conceptually but feels emotionally low-friction for a supposedly destabilizing discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s divided loyalty between the old astronomers, Maren, and “the storm itself” is clear and consistent, and his ultimate choice to descend and side with the storm is motivated by that internal split. However, his emotions remain largely conceptual; we’re told of his turbulence more than we feel it in concrete, embodied ways. The key action—subtly altering the frequencies—happens quickly and without much dramatized struggle, softening the cost of his decision. Still, the interior contradiction is well articulated and carries through to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is clear, specific, and emotionally legible; his calloused ritual with jars and the reaction to the music box ground him as a distinct sensibility. His core motivation—to preserve fleeting beauty and become a “translator between generations”—tracks cleanly through his choices. However, interior conflict is minimal and largely idealized; we don’t see any true opposing impulse (apathy, despair, self-protection) pushing back against his redemptive drive. The shift from purposelessness to clear vocation is moving but a bit too smooth to feel fully hard-won at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he exists to protect the artifact via this ritual—and his embodied focus (breath, trembling, the feel of the key) gives him some specificity. However, there’s almost no internal contradiction or real struggle; his “logically emotional” stance is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The ritual never seriously tests him or exposes a flaw, so the final commitment feels like a continuation rather than an earned, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, ritual, and core motive are clear and consistent, and the “wildness beneath her softly purposeful movements” gives her a credible inner contradiction. However, she faces no real resistance on the page, so her internal conflict never forces a hard trade-off or mistake. The final shift toward endurance/patience feels earned but relatively costless. A relationship crucible or a more pressured choice would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s profession, family history, and emotional armor are clearly established, and her link between the current case and her father reads specific rather than generic. However, her internal conflict resolves a little too cleanly into empowerment (“The controlling influence was broken, and she was finally free”) without much on-page struggle or contradictory impulse in the peak beat. Some phrasing (“controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) leans toward therapy-speak rather than embodied, character-particular emotion. The final shift feels plausible but somewhat under-costed and over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to redeem an apology through concrete action—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices, and Anja’s calm expertise provides a strong relational crucible. His embodied unease around the heart is well-rendered, and the Silas relationship, though mostly off-page, still exerts psychological pressure. However, internal contradiction is relatively light: once the threat is understood, his path is morally straightforward, with little genuine temptation or error. The final “I understood my true purpose” moment edges toward neat epiphany rather than a more conflicted, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    Zephyr’s core motivation (yearning for the Silent Bell) is clear and consistent, and the “yearning algorithm” gives a nice quasi-emotional engine, but interior contradiction and embodied feeling are thin. The piece tells us Zephyr is “steadily curious” and driven toward Completion, yet we don’t see genuine struggle, doubt, or competing impulses under pressure. The overseer’s presence doesn’t become a true relational crucible; its single line of dialogue offers color more than active pressure. The arc closes on intensified purpose rather than a legible change or costly renunciation, which keeps the character work from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession, professional role, and moral line are clear and consistent, and his investigative choices feel rooted in that characterization. Interiority is vivid (“he knew the shape of what wasn’t there”), but contradictory impulses under pressure are only lightly sketched—his final decision to broadcast reads determined rather than genuinely conflicted. Emotional cost remains largely implied rather than embodied on the page. The character is strong for this length but doesn’t quite achieve full psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Shael’s motivation—to answer the Council and maintain balance—is clear and tied to their unusual capacity for empathy, and their methodical choices with the fragment and mirrors track logically. However, internal contradiction and emotional cost are underdeveloped; Shael’s “courageous anomaly” status is told rather than tested under real strain. Their calm competence flattens potential conflict, and we rarely see impulses in tension. The final act (“Equality”) feels earned enough conceptually but not deeply wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arthur’s interiority is vivid, specific, and consistent, from his “loosely” held reality to the tactile comfort of the parasol tip in his pocket. His motivation—seeking the sound of endings—is clear and threads through each choice (clinic, then disaster volunteering, then staying in the marina). The change at the end (reframing endings as endurance) is earned by accumulated observations, though it’s more contemplative than pressured. The main limitation is that we rarely see him make a hard, costly on-page decision; he mostly endures and reflects.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentinel’s motivation is clearly stated and consistent, but it’s largely told rather than dramatized, and its emotional life remains abstract. Lila and Marc feel more like roles (estranged couple) than individuated people; we never learn what specifically drove them apart, so their shift back toward each other feels generic. Their reconciliation is plausible but frictionless, with little sense of contradictory impulses or cost. This keeps the characters from fully supporting a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    The line walker has a clear, consistent motivation and professional specificity (“walking the line between worlds”), but he experiences almost no real internal contradiction or emotional volatility under pressure. His “strangely honest” nature informs one micro-choice (returning to the clearing) but isn’t deeply dramatized. The cost of his commitment is more implied than felt moment-to-moment, and his interiority skews functional rather than distinctive. As a result, the ending registers as steady fulfillment rather than a hard-won change or charged renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and inner texture (“a secret he carried like a moth in a jar”) are vivid and specific, and his actions align cleanly with his obsession to shape sorrow into art. However, he experiences very little genuine internal contradiction or testing of values under pressure; his calm, focused stance never really fractures or complicates. The final “choice” to remain as archivist feels more like continuation than a hard-earned pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scholar’s motivation is clear and specific—studying the silence and the “pattern of growth”—and his actions (salvaging the crystal, running the experiment, choosing to become a witness) align cleanly with that drive. Interiority is textured and embodied (“chill seeping into his bones,” “heart a slow, heavy drum”), but we see little true internal contradiction under pressure—his shift from analyst to witness is graceful rather than hard-won. Emotional cost is present but relatively understated: keeping the crystal as a “fragile testament” reads as acceptance more than a conflicted sacrifice. For this length, the arc from academic curiosity to solemn custodianship lands, but a sharper clash between his analytic impulse and the surrender to silence would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to capture the sound of growing older as an antidote to his precognitive forgetfulness—is vivid, specific, and consistently drives his actions. His interiority is textured and embodied (“sandbar eroding,” the tactile comfort of the chalk), and his forgetfulness concretely shapes his behavior. However, his internal conflict remains mostly one-directional (pure longing and loss of memory) rather than dramatizing sharply opposed impulses in the moment. The final “choice” to draw with the chalk lands more as fulfillment of a fixed drive than as a pressured, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael is clear, competent, and grounded in his craft, and his methodical temperament convincingly drives his choices under pressure. However, his interiority leans more toward functional description than contradiction or genuine internal conflict; he rarely feels torn, merely determined. The emotional cost is gestured at (“luminous ache,” fatigue) but not deeply particularized beyond stock formulations. As a result, the final quiet smile reads earned but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elijah’s role and motives are clear and consistent—his “decisively kind” drive to execute a flawless goodbye cleanly explains his actions. Mr. Hale’s regret over the unfinished arrangement is vivid enough to ground the scene. However, there’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; Elijah never faces a moment where his serenity is meaningfully strained. The emotional calibration remains slightly too tidy, with no visible cost to Elijah beyond a generalized poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core drive and competence are clear and consistent, and her calm under pressure feels character-specific rather than generic. Her motivation to understand and repair the world is well-grounded in both backstory and on-page action. However, genuine internal contradiction is only lightly touched—her fear surfaces briefly but never really complicates her choices. A deeper dramatization of conflicting impulses under peak stress would lift this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor is sharply drawn as a “forgiving skeptic,” with her clinical habits and quiet openness to the impossible feeling specific and believable. Her small hesitation before giving up the tooth is a real, if brief, moment of internal conflict that aligns with her traits. The changeling child is sketched with efficient, eerie authority. The main limitation is that Eleanor’s emotional arc moves very smoothly, with little real resistance undercutting the sense of costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to share a gentle, flameless light—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her history as an “earthbound star watcher.” We get concrete interiority through her relationship to the sea glass and stars, but her emotional journey is mostly smooth and contemplative, with limited on-page contradiction or real struggle. The final renunciation/fulfillment (leaving the glass behind, walking on “earthbound no longer in spirit”) is earned but low-friction. The lack of sharper internal conflict keeps this from a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives—seeking sanctuary from the viral aftermath while still needing to transform her grief—are clear and consistent, and the decision to hand over the pendant undercuts her protective instincts in a credible way. The pendant, her body responses (hand tightening, trembling), and awareness of online mockery all reveal layered vulnerability. Maya is thinner but still registers as a wary, similarly wounded counterpart whose presence meaningfully pressures Elara. There’s a slight gloss of “therapist language,” but it’s grounded enough in concrete behavior not to feel purely diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The novelist’s motivation (regaining purpose, overcoming block) is clear and consistently tied to his actions in the nexus. We get a solid sense of his exhaustion and pressure from publisher and fans, but much of this is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene under pressure. His shift from “broken vessel” to “conduit” is thematically apt but lands as a clean epiphany with limited on-page ambivalence or cost. The unwritten characters are evocative but remain largely symbolic rather than individuated personalities.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s goal and temperament are clear, and his tenderness toward the automaton and the vine gives him a gentle specificity. However, his interiority stays relatively one-note—reverent, purposeful, nostalgic—with almost no contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. The story tells us the “weight of tradition” is on him, but we don’t see that weight distort his choices or produce mistakes. His change at the end (relief, gratitude) feels earned but low-cost and emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s vocation, lineage, and purpose are clear and specific, and his actions align tightly with them, but we rarely feel contradictory impulses or real emotional strain under pressure. His “patience” is shown in concrete tasks (tweezers, sorting) rather than just told, which helps, yet there’s little sense of what it costs him or what he fears. The interiority stays mostly at the level of ritual focus and inherited duty, so the final act reads as a continuation rather than a pressured choice. This keeps the characterization strong-but-flat rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s competence and reflective nature are well realized, and his locksmith mindset maps cleanly onto the metaphysical task. Motivation is clear and consistent, and his methodical attention reads character-specific rather than generic. However, he experiences almost no visible internal conflict or contradictory impulse, so the emotional arc feels flatter than the conceptual arc. The final stance (conservationist of wonder) is earned but costs him little on the page beyond patience and solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s vocation and motivation are clear and particular—the drive to “collect the weights of different burdens” is distinctive and consistent with her fractal sensibility. However, she experiences almost no on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulses about calcifying herself, so her choice reads more as foregone ritual than pressured decision. The mentor’s warning is mentioned but never meaningfully complicates her stance in-scene. As a result, the ending functions more as completion of an intention than as a felt, costly turn in character.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmute grief into craft—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions and rituals. Her interiority is textured (“hauntingly practical response to loss”), with concrete habits (working as the kettle boils) that reveal character. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or live inner conflict; she feels already resolved rather than pushed into a new, costly choice. The endurance she lands on is credible, but the emotional turn is gentle rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is clear and specific—his regret, the ghost of his former self, and the barter of stories all feel motivated and coherent. The link between the brittle camera wheel and his “eroded” ambitions is an effective character-object mirror. However, the decisive shift (“The ghost was gone, and so was the regret”) moves a bit too quickly into resolution, with limited on-page struggle in the final beats. The internal conflict could use one more concrete moment of resistance or failure before the turn to feel fully earned at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara has a clear professional lens and motivation, and her actions (studying the pipes, opening the valve, redirecting flows) align with that. However, she reads more as an emblem of “engineered hope” than as a fully conflicted person; there’s little sense of competing impulses, fear of failure, or cost. Emotions tend to be summarized in abstractions like “stoic wonder” rather than embodied contradiction. The closing smile and recommitment feel gentle but not deeply earned through strain.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s interiority is clear, specific, and grounded in concrete sensory triggers—especially the way the droplets’ music awakens his buried longing. His core contradiction (devoted time-keeper vs. suppressed musician) is strong, but he rarely feels genuinely torn in the moment; once he goes to the forecourt, the progression toward reconciliation is smooth rather than pressured. The emotional arc from avoidance to acceptance is credible and earned, though somewhat tidy. The lack of other on-page characters limits relational pressure but fits the piece’s design.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation—shifting from treasure-hunting to dissecting a lie—is clear and consistently dramatized, especially in lines like “He was not hunting for treasure, but for the source code of the deception.” His interiority feels character-specific, grounded in tactile noticing and professional habit. The internal conflict between needing the legend for purpose and wanting to kill it is present but could be sharpened with one or two more moments of real hesitation or self-sabotage under pressure. The final repricing of his life’s work is earned, though it lands a touch smoothly, with little irrational resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has a clear, particular motivation (preserving forgotten knowledge) rooted in his background as a seed collector, and his actions—coming to the dock, decoding, offering the fulgurite—align with that. Interiority is present but largely serene; he rarely experiences real doubt or contradictory impulses under pressure. His “infinite patience” is asserted more than tested, so we don’t see him strained. The weaver functions more as a gatekeeper-symbol than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is specific and textured—a professional with an odd, coherent vocation whose way of seeing the world is clear. His emotional state (lonely yet nourished by the garden and his work) is well embodied through perception more than label. However, internal contradiction under pressure is mild; he rarely feels actively torn, and his arc lands closer to affirmation of preexisting beliefs than a tested shift. The gardener is vivid but entirely off-page, so the relationship pressure remains conceptual rather than dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to reawaken beauty in a dead mechanical world—is vivid, consistent, and credibly extreme given his isolation and tinkering. His interiority is concrete and particular (grease-stained prince, trembling hands, near-ecstatic theorizing), and his final choice to destroy the palace at the moment of rebirth feels earned. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: he moves fairly smoothly from hypothesis to sacrifice without much on-page hesitation, fear, or competing value, which would be needed at elite level. The absence of any live relational crucible (no other character to resist or tempt him) slightly flattens the pressure on his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and history—firefighter born from an arsonist’s shadow—are vivid, coherent, and consistently inform her present choices, especially the ritualized planting and coin offering. Interiority is particular rather than generic, with the ignition-point knowledge nicely repurposed toward prevention. However, she faces little on-page resistance and exhibits minimal contradictory impulse; she already fully subscribes to her credo, so the ending feels like confirmation rather than a costly shift. The lack of visible inner conflict undercuts what could be an even more incisive character study.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—to open the box and reclaim/understand his memories—is clear and consistently pursued, with the grandmother thread giving it emotional weight. His “luminous skepticism” versus rising hope is dramatized, especially at the sapling, though the internal conflict could be embodied more viscerally. The final shift from skepticism to “pure, unfiltered light” feels earned by the breadcrumb journey and his decision to leave the box behind. Emotional texture leans slightly toward summary and rhetoric at peak beats rather than detailed contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sentimentalist has a clear, particular motivation (the vow to “share light without using fire”) and a palpable internal tension between reverence for the garden’s patterns and fear of mechanized stasis. Its choice to integrate rather than destroy the gear is motivated and carries emotional cost (joy and loss in the final paragraphs). However, interiority stays relatively abstract—more archetypal than individuated—and contradictory impulses are stated rather than deeply dramatized in body or thought. This limits the depth of character change even as the arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is clearly motivated and particular—his craft, family ritual, and openness to “spectral mentorship” feel specific and consistent. His emotional life is mostly rendered through action (carving, walking, touching the stone) rather than labels, which helps. However, his internal conflict is muted; he rarely seems truly torn, more serenely aligned with his purpose. The final shift feels like deepening a stance he already holds rather than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt, diligence, and quasi-religious sense of duty are vivid and consistent, and his ritualized penance is well-motivated by the twelve-minute failure. However, some interiority leans on abstract labels (“ethically diligent by nature,” “searing reverie”) instead of fully embodied contradiction. His final easing of shame feels earned by prior setup, though the cost remains mostly internal and gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation and core motivation (“to discover the shape of intentions that kept certain spirits earthbound”) are clear and consistently expressed in his choices and perceptions. His competence and gentleness come through in concrete occupational detail rather than labels. However, he faces almost no internal contradiction or real doubt; he does not pay an evident emotional price for his calling. The ending’s reaffirmation of his role feels earned but low-cost and relatively untested.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cartographer’s core motive—using cultivated “ignorance” to plan futures—is clear and consistent, and his professional identity feels particular. However, he faces almost no real resistance, and we don’t see contradictory impulses or genuinely difficult micro-choices under pressure. Emotions are largely stated rather than embodied; his “quiet confidence” at the end isn’t strongly earned by struggle on the page. The result is evocative but emotionally and psychologically flatter than the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s core motivation (preserving and reanimating stories) is clear and consistent, and his profession as a copyist aligns well with his actions. However, interiority stays largely at the summary/idea level; we get very little moment-to-moment contradiction, fear, or doubt as he follows the broadcast’s guidance. His big choices—taking the crystal, singing in the hall—come without much felt resistance or cost. The final stance shift (from copier to creator/teacher) is conceptually earned but emotionally under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (“to crystallize a fleeting emotion”) is clear and carries through the scene, and his profession/history with ash and portraits roots his choices in something particular. Interiority is embodied enough (trembling hands, shallow breath) to avoid abstraction, and his self-description as a “charlatan” adds a welcome edge. However, internal contradiction under live pressure is muted—he proceeds with relatively little friction or ambivalence beyond generalized ache. The final acceptance feels earned but could carry more visible cost or conflict to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sebastian’s motivation—to preserve suppressed truth through archaeological work—is clear and coherently expressed in both action (mapping sewers, cataloguing narratives) and reflection. His identity as a sewer-dwelling philosopher is particular and convincing, with details like gas mask use and coded journals rooting him. Internal conflict around futility (“could one man…”) appears but is underdeveloped; he never seriously wavers or makes a costly trade-off. Emotions skew conceptual rather than embodied, with little felt stress or degradation under rising physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s motivation—to preserve vanishing musical traditions and heal inherited divisions—is clear, consistent, and linked to concrete actions (transcribing rosette notation, arranging rehearsals). However, her interiority leans toward thesis and summary rather than textured, contradictory impulses under pressure. The students and administration function mostly as abstractions; we’re told of board resistance but never see them exert live pressure. The final stance (quiet perseverance) feels coherent but low-cost on the page, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—using her rare sensory gift to resist the world’s deadened state—and her choices (especially not eating the fruit herself) align with that. Her interiority is vivid in how her emotions directly shape the plant, giving her an embodied, particular presence. Internal conflict exists (anger, bitterness vs. hope) but remains relatively gentle; she never feels truly at risk of failing herself. The final endurance choice is credible and earned, but not psychologically surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply sketched: his involuntary honesty, isolation, and tenderness toward the drones and the poem give him specificity and coherence. His motivation to preserve wonder is clear and his key choice—surrendering the lacquer box—tracks cleanly with what we’ve learned about him. Internal contradiction (comfort in secrecy vs. compulsion to truth) is present but could be dramatized more directly under pressure rather than mostly implied. The girl is more emblematic than individuated, but that suits the length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated by a longstanding obsession with “why some houses seem to hum with an inner life,” and his actions in the cottage are consistent with that trait. Interiority is textured through his sensory attention, but he remains largely unconflicted and faces little emotional cost or genuine risk in pursuing his goal. The final “confirmation” of his theory is more validation than change, so the internal arc is modest. Strong specificity of worldview, limited evolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s characterization is rich and particular—his perception of “fractures in things” and his reframing from mere guardian to interlocutor feel specific and earned. His motivation to move from static preservation to welcoming nuance is clear and tracks into his final choice to answer. Internal contradiction (wariness vs. curiosity, duty vs. vulnerability) is present but could be pushed slightly harder in-scene to heighten cost. The emotional states are mostly shown through his attention and choices rather than flat labels.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a grim optimist whose mathematical mind and regret over a single miscalculation drive every action. His fixation on "the texture of a missed opportunity" and the chipped die give him a particular, non-generic interiority. Internal conflict (despair vs. stubborn hope) is present but often told rather than tightly dramatized, so the emotional cost of his years on the staircase feels somewhat abstract. The final change—from self-punishing loop to self-forgiving agency—is credible and earned, but could land harder with more embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her insomnia, artistic frustration, and quasi-mystical belief in kindness as language feel coherent and grounded in concrete habits. Her motivation to test whether kindness leaves a trace is clear and drives every choice on the page. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction or visible cost—her desperation is stated more than it is dramatized through risky or self-damaging choices. The final shift to “quiet triumph” is earned but a bit too untroubled to fully deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her museum-guide mindset filters everything through erosion, cataloging, and preservation—and her choice to add an “L” for the fresco cleanly reveals her hierarchy of values. The bodily grounding (knuckles white while kneading, the taste of wheat and ash) keeps emotion embodied rather than abstract. Internal conflict is present but quiet: she clings to the emerald lens as a token of the old world yet ultimately sets it aside for communal ritual. Secondary characters (Kaelen, the child) are lightly sketched but functional, applying pressure rather than stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The clock maker’s ambition and temperament are clearly established, and his final choice to let go of the yoyo feels motivated by years of obsession rather than a sudden whim. However, his inner conflict is underplayed: he moves fairly smoothly from anticipation to action with little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse. The story favors archetypal “seeker of power” energy over idiosyncratic psychological texture. The cost to him is vivid, but more as a conceptual fate than as a deeply personal, specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s attraction/repulsion toward death and the funhouse is clear and consistent, and the internal conflict around choosing the “still dead” path feels motivated. Embodied detail (sweat, trembling) grounds the abstractions enough to keep the stakes felt. The advisor is more of a thematic mouthpiece than a character but does exert pressure. The final shift—from wanting to escape the curse to embracing it as artistic medium—reads earned, though the emotional cost is somewhat underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prophet’s vocation and worldview are vivid, but they function more as archetype than individuated person; interior contradiction and concrete emotional cost are underplayed. We’re told of transforming “loneliness into composition,” yet we never feel a live struggle between loneliness and its transmutation in a specific moment. Micro-choices (which fruit to strike, how to respond to the storm’s aftermath) are described, but none are framed as difficult or value-testing. The endurance at the end (“that was simply how survival made its music”) reads more as restated premise than an earned renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (curiosity, confinement, and her father’s legacy) is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially her obsessive mapping and eventual decision to use the whistle. “Quietly driven” is well dramatized in her long-term study of the watchers and social withdrawal. Internal conflict—fear vs. need to know, loyalty to the city vs. to her father—remains more implied than fully dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The final endurance choice (accepting her role as communicator rather than crossing the gate) feels earned but its emotional cost could be embodied more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and professional mindset are clear and consistent, and his “emotionally rational” trait shows in his calm response and tactical movement during the confrontation. Internal conflict (truth vs. peace) is mostly stated rather than deeply dramatized in scene, so the final stance feels a bit too straightforward. The station master has a legible arc from defender of the lie to reluctant surrender, but it turns quickly and remains lightly sketched. Overall, the characterization is solid but could use more layered, embodied ambivalence at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply defined: professional habits, family legacy, and his ritual of note-placing all cohere into a distinct, believable psyche. His motivation to document “abandoned dreams” is clear and consistent with his behavior. What’s missing at this echelon is a live, on-page internal contradiction or cost-bearing choice—he endures rather than being genuinely torn. The emotional palette is rich but largely one-note in its direction (reverent melancholy) rather than dynamically conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is cleanly sketched as methodical, curious, and quietly obsessive, and his indexing mindset credibly drives his actions. His emotional life is thinner: we get quickened heartbeat and trembling fingers, but little contradictory feeling or real cost to his discovery. The “tranquilly perceptive” label is borne out in his noticing anomalies, but it remains more descriptor than dramatized flaw. His final “change” is primarily intellectual rather than a pressured, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation is sharply etched and deeply embedded in action: every polishing choice and focus on a specific dream detail tracks back to his impossible goal of reclaiming Liora. The contradiction between knowing his project is a “beautiful madness” and persisting anyway gives him real complexity and an earned stasis at the end. Emotions are embodied through craft rather than labels (e.g., his trembling mind against sure hands). The only mild limitation is that his internal conflict doesn’t evolve much within the scene; it deepens rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief, isolation, and quasi-religious turn toward potential as a “resource” are clear and character-specific, especially in how the geode and the Mapper reflect his inner life. His motivation—to reframe loss into something he can map and harvest—reads psychologically plausible and consistent with his history as a drone-strike survivor. However, internal contradiction under pressure is mostly thematic (horror vs ecstasy) rather than dramatized as conflicting impulses that change his visible choices in-scene. The closing stance shift into “hunter” is interesting but lands a touch declarative rather than earned through on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai’s motivations (curiosity, prior military training, hunger for connection) are clear and consistently expressed, and their choice to override “conventional programming” is a credible turn. However, interior conflict remains fairly thin: the tension between obedience to the organization and surrender to the “frequency of belonging” is stated more than it is dramatized. Emotional response is often abstract (“resonance,” “frequency”) rather than bodily or specific, which keeps us slightly distant. The closing sense of “journey just begun again” is thematically apt but doesn’t carry a sharply felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is vividly drawn: his ritual with the driftwood, the watch hand, and his conflicted dependence on his illicit work all feel specific and psychologically credible. His guilt over both the grandfather and Mara’s brother coheres into a clear, pressurized motive for this conversation. Mara is somewhat less interior but still distinct, with her sculptor’s eye and measured physicality signaling a different way of processing pain. The final choice—to invite her to the shore and accept shared burden—feels earned, though their reconciliation edges slightly toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Julian’s guilt, professionalism, and philosophical bent are clearly established, and the drawer pull grounds his inner life in a concrete object. However, under pressure he never truly faces a difficult on-page choice; the exchange proceeds smoothly, so his “uncommonly thoughtful” nature is more observed than tested. Internal conflict is mostly retrospective (Zaatari) rather than dramatized in the present moment. The final “untethering” is emotionally plausible but comes a bit easily given the minimal present-tense friction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt, avoidance of celestial tools, and compulsive return to the sea create a layered, credible interior life, with concrete conflicts like using utility poles instead of the compass. The apprentice’s death and her professional fall feel integrated rather than bolted-on. The final shift—accepting that the issue is her relationship to her calling, not the tool—feels earned. The only limit is that her “merrily melancholic” facade is more told than dramatically tested against another person or live relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation (to recover a sense of empathy and understand his past) is clear and consistent, and his ambivalence—needing answers he doesn’t truly want—is credible. Interiority is textured and specific to his worldview, especially his “jaded sort of wonder.” However, the “dirty past” remains generic, with only broad hints of “violence,” which blunts the emotional cost of his final choice. The closing realization skirts the edge of being a tidy epiphany but is mostly earned by the preceding journey.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and inner conflict—yearning for Shadowpaw versus fear of losing her humanity—are clear and consistent, and her choices track cleanly to that tension. Her emotions are mostly embodied through sensory perception and small actions at the altar, not just labels. Shadowpaw is thinner but still individualized via “cosmic eyes” and voice quality. The main limitation is that her reluctance softens too quickly, so the final acceptance carries less visible psychological cost than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cartomancer’s motivation—recovering “stolen moments” with her daughter—is vivid, consistent, and drives each concrete choice (climbing, unfastening spells, opening the portal). Her grief is embodied through tactile rituals (inked fingers, hand-tracing, the saucer) rather than abstract labels. Internal conflict between wanting to reclaim time and needing to endure what remains is present, though it could be dramatized with one sharper moment of hesitation or error under pressure. The final stance (learning to inhabit what remains) feels earned by prior beats rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifism, training, and peculiar lightness trait give her a coherent, particular identity, and her motivation to open the locked dimension is clear and consistent. Her internal struggle during the stitching—confronting fear, regret, doubt—is effective but summarized rather than dramatized in specific, idiosyncratic beats. The final renunciation (opening the portal but not entering) is motivated and thematically aligned, though the emotional cost could be embodied more concretely. Overall she feels solid and non-generic, but not yet fully three-dimensional at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motivation and worldview are clear—his destitute philanthropy and hunger to understand “the texture of transformation” give him a distinct frame. However, his internal conflict remains thin; we don’t see genuine contradictory impulses or a real emotional price for his choices. His reactions to the dropped bottle and the discovery are convincing but not especially idiosyncratic. The ending realization feels earned enough but lightly bought, with little sense of what it costs him.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s role, competence, and basic moral conflict (duty to the commanders vs. pursuit of truth) are clear and consistent, and her inventiveness is decently dramatized through the sundial decoding and secret-panel choice. However, her emotional life is under-embodied: we get little visceral sense of fear, doubt, or stakes in her body. The decisive choice to side with the engineers comes quickly and with minimal felt cost on the page. Internal contradiction is present in concept but not richly dramatized in moment-to-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The eel herder is specific, competent, and clearly motivated by the inherited promise and the practical crisis of friction’s disappearance. Her interiority—especially around isolation, failed attempts, and obligation—feels grounded in concrete details (the prior collapse, the mentor’s disappearance). However, we see little true contradiction or messy ambivalence under pressure; once the ritual begins, her path is relatively straight. The final choice to become part of the geometry is thematically apt but arrives with limited psychological wrestling on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation—mapping scars of self and world under censorship—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his relationship to the envelope and poem. Internal conflict between safety in silence and the urge to defy it is embodied in the trembling hands and the tearing envelope. The final shift from “witness” to “cartographer” feels earned by the preceding vigil. The only limitation is that some emotional shading leans on reiterated metaphors rather than new, concrete complications.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias and Lyra feel distinct in speech, gesture, and status, and his relationship to the mechanical arm and needle card gives him some texture. However, interior conflict is minimal; Elias never seems genuinely at risk of losing status, belief, or control. The shift from tension to mutual understanding happens smoothly without a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses. The final rapprochement therefore feels pleasant but lightly earned on the character level.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is vivid as a vagrant poet with a covert activist streak, and Maya’s history as a prison librarian fired for “dangerous material” gives her clear, believable drive. Motivation is legible and aligned with actions (helping Ms. Harrow, revealing the tin, organizing resistance). However, the “molts personalities monthly” trait is mostly told, not dramatized through specific conflicted choices, so internal contradiction under pressure feels underused. The emotional cost of his shifting self versus enduring commitments is gestured at in the last paragraph but not fully earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pianist’s longing and quiet determination are clear and consistent, and his choice to risk the clock for a chance at “rewriting” time feels motivated. However, interiority leans on generalized mood (“wistful,” “at peace”) rather than concrete, character-specific contradictions. We’re told he is “strategically creative” more than we experience his problem-solving under real pressure. The final peace lands, but the emotional cost of what he’s risking or relinquishing never fully textures his inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s role and motivation are clear and specific—his “reality checker” function, reverence for the ridge, and need to protect collective memory all cohere. The luminous doubt gives him an internal texture, but it rarely generates real hesitation or a costly misstep; he moves rather smoothly from problem to solution. His emotional responses are mostly told via elevated abstractions rather than grounded in a few sharper, embodied moments under peak pressure. The closing shift from doubt to “nascent certainty” is plausible but feels a bit easily earned for an elite-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kenji’s interiority is specific and coherent—his patience, avoidance, and bonsai practice all align with his inability to speak to Aiko and his slow work of processing regret. The use of concrete rituals (tracing lace, tending the pine, testing out “I regret” to the breeze) grounds his emotional life. Internal conflict is present but understated: he wants to atone yet also clings to safety in solitude. The final acceptance of possibility over reconciliation feels earned, though the arc remains relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a static vehicle for the magic system rather than a character under pressure. Her motivation ("strip needless drama") is explained via summary rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or internal conflict in the scene. There is no active struggle; she simply performs her role without cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is abstractly summarized ("discover purpose in the pauses") rather than dramatized through pressure or distinct micro-choices. The trait "steadily adaptive" is inserted as a label for backstory survival without influencing a present-tense decision or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by a label ("The capsize survivor") rather than specific, contradictory internal traits. Her emotional arc is linear and devoid of difficult micro-choices; she moves from determination to success without genuine on-page struggle. The internal state is summarized via abstract nouns ("grief," "wonder") rather than dramatized through conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is stated clearly, but the character's internal landscape is delivered through summary labels ("inadvertent stubbornness," "obsessive refusal") rather than dramatized choice. The leap from a workshop repair to a life-threatening magical expedition feels like a plot function rather than a grounded character decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist functions as a fable archetype rather than a realized individual; interiority is summarized as general intent ("understood that survival depended") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or specific micro-choices in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elias functions as a passive vessel for the prompt's magical elements rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. His acceptance of the supernatural memory is frictionless, and his "trembling" signals emotion that is never operationalized into a dilemma or a decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Internal conflict is legible, but the characterization relies on abstract labels ("retrocognitively trapped") and melodramatic rhetorical questions ("salvation or his doom?") rather than embodied emotion. The wife functions as a prop for grief rather than a character with distinct memory-texture, reducing the emotional weight of the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clearly established, and his role as a "chained liberator" anchors the scene. However, his interiority relies on stock phrasing ("Panic flared, but he forced it down") rather than specific, contradictory emotion. The character functions as a vehicle for the plot but lacks the nuanced psychological depth or unexpected reactions required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a specific, embodied history, but his internal arc is static; he functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character forced to make a difficult choice under pressure. His motivation is explicitly stated ("singular and unyielding") rather than dramatized through struggle or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for philosophical abstraction than a living character; his motivation ("press his ear against destiny’s door") remains metaphorical and vague. The epiphany is triggered by external magic (the painting smiling) rather than an earned internal struggle or difficult choice. Interiority consists largely of "purple" longing rather than specific, grounded emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.1)
    Characterization relies on explicit labeling ("thoughtfully spirited," "singular motivation") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's dialogue is unnatural ("Behold"), and the internal conflict is abstract, lacking genuine emotional stakes or human specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by diagnostic labels ("adaptive," "phobia") rather than specific, embodied behavior; the "stunt double" profession does not shape his tactics or worldview. Emotional transitions are summarized ("cracked that resolve," "hope ignited") rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.0)
    Characterization relies on told labels like &quot;mildly obsessed&quot; rather than demonstrating the trait through costly action. Interiority is described with abstract metaphors (&quot;marbled hush within him&quot;) instead of embodied emotion, and the contrast with the predecessor's madness lacks dramatic weight in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clearly stated, but the character's transition from janitor to cosmic sentinel feels unearned by struggle or cost. The decision to override the program lacks internal friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by a single mood (quiet) rather than contradictory desires or specific traits. The emotional arc from isolation to "home" occurs instantly without earned vulnerability or hesitation, lacking the friction of genuine human mistrust. The registrar’s internal logic—deciding to "eavesdrop" on visual symbols—reads as an authorial conceit rather than a character-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elias is sympathetic, but his passivity at the climax undermines the character arc; he merely witnesses the resolution rather than enacting it. The emotional reaction relies on clichés ("trembling hands") rather than specific, embodied nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias acts as a functional archetype without internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his "personal" motivation is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks genuine internal conflict or a distinct personality beyond his role as a musician. Motivation is externally imposed via a "strange inspiration" rather than arising from character traits, and the ending offers a cost-free resolution where he gains a spiritual victory without sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara is defined primarily by the "fault-tolerant oracle" label, which functions as a plot device to bypass investigative agency. Her motivation is abstract ("find the weight"), and the emotional realization relies on asserted traits rather than dramatized internal conflict or struggle. The "oracle" ability flattens the human cost of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's "religious skepticism" is stated as a label but immediately contradicted by his frictionless acceptance of a supernatural solution, failing to generate internal conflict. The motivation ("swallowed truth") remains abstract and melodramatic, lacking the specific grounding needed to make the emotional release feel earned rather than performative.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist is an archetype with static motivation ("simply to observe") that faces no internal contradiction or meaningful struggle. The character functions as a passive vessel for the setting rather than an agent making high-stakes choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is clear, but the internal landscape relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("emotional reconnection," "shared vulnerability") rather than embodied experience. The breakthrough with Leo feels unearned due to a lack of genuine resistance or friction; he yields to the therapy immediately, making the protagonist's competence feel inevitable rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria functions primarily as a vehicle for the investigative plot rather than a fully realized character; her "oddness" and "sensitively perceptive nature" are stated traits that act as tools rather than sources of internal conflict. While her motivation to collect stories is clear, she faces no significant emotional or psychological struggle during the excavation, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist is an omnipotent archetype rather than a character under pressure; he faces no internal contradiction, struggles with no difficult choices, and pays no emotional or physical price for his actions. He functions purely as a device to execute the premise, lacking the vulnerability or flawed agency required for a literary arc. His "rare satisfaction" feels unearned because he encounters no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the prompt's concept rather than a fully realized character. There is no internal conflict, contradiction, or specific interiority; he performs the ritual without facing a dilemma that requires a meaningful personal choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is distinct and drives the action, though it relies heavily on the "chronological homesickness" label rather than dramatized longing in the early beats. The resignation at the closure—accepting the return to his mundane trade—provides a solid, character-specific grounding to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("gravity defier," "periodically eternal") rather than embodied personality. The protagonist's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" remains a vague concept, never grounded in a specific, felt desire or distinct stakes beyond the prompt's assertion. Interiority consists of melodramatic generalizations rather than specific psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal landscape is compelling, and her motivation—a physical hunger for vibration—drives agency effectively. The shift from the "filament of hush" to the "messy throb" provides a clear emotional arc, though the initial state relies slightly on labeling ("emotional numbness") rather than purely dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on adjectives ("meticulous," "credibly curious") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal state is summarized through abstract labels like "integrity" and "curious nature" rather than embodied through specific, idiosyncratic thought or action. The transition from caution to risk-taking at the end feels rushed and unearned by the prior interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is clearly drawn, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels rather than embodied experience, particularly at the climax. The realization about the &quot;conflation of absence&quot; reads as a summary of therapy rather than a felt epiphany in the moment, flattening the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.7)
    Langdon serves as a clear vessel for the story's themes, but his defining trait of "ethical playfulness" is stated rather than dramatized through pressure-filled choices. The backstory of the prisoner attempts to provide emotional weight but feels disconnected from the abstract, metaphysical stakes of the grotto, resulting in a character who observes rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lyra's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("absence of purpose") and standard emotional cues ("fingers bled") rather than contradictory, embodied struggle. The realization that resolves her grief feels epiphanic and soft—a gift of the moment rather than a hard-won psychological shift paid for with a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's shift from professional detachment to empathy relies on a told "unexpected pang" rather than earned causal pressure. The character functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's keywords, lacking the contradictory interiority or genuine struggle required for a high-quality literary arc.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("shrewd," "cautious exuberance") rather than embodied action. Marla's motivation is stated as a noble thesis ("uplift silent contributors") without the internal friction or selfish complexity that creates depth; she functions primarily as a plot device to enable connections.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminescence aching," "boldly sympathetic") rather than dramatized behavior. Kael's internal state is asserted through metaphor rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Elara functions as a flat device to deliver the moral and guide the protagonist, lacking her own agency or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear, high-stakes motivation rooted in his profession and worldview. The internal conflict between preservation (illustration) and release (breaking the loop) is well-drawn, though the final emotional beat—a "smile" while facing annihilation—feels slightly cliché and undercuts the tragic weight of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is summarized via labels ("buried optimism") rather than enacted through struggle, and the protagonist's internal state lacks the contradictory impulses required for depth. The resolution is an intellectual realization delivered by the magic system rather than a choice made under pressure, resulting in a character arc that feels told rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his "kindly methodical nature" is asserted as a label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure. The character remains static, acting as a benevolent archetype without personal cost or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the shift from observer to participant is a strong character arc. However, interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic labels ("frustrating, illogical emotion," "state of quiet desperation") rather than embodied sensation in the middle beats. The "pity" beat is a pivotal micro-turn, but it is told rather than shown through physical reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a vessel for themes rather than a distinct psychological entity; her internal state is described via repeated labels ("haggard awe") rather than demonstrated through specific, conflicted choices. The interaction with the stranger lacks genuine friction or status dynamics, reading as a transactional plot device rather than a human encounter. Motivation is articulated in dialogue rather than felt through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara observes rather than acts, with her primary "choice" being to touch an object that magically solves her internal lack. The narrative resolves her conflict through an external power-up ("unseen forces") rather than a character-defining sacrifice or trade-off with visible cost. The emotional arc feels unearned because the protagonist is a vessel for the magic rather than an agent of change.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("reactively visionary") rather than demonstrated traits. Elara faces no internal contradiction or meaningful opposition, resulting in a competence-heavy arc with no personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by labels ("meticulous," "analytically artistic") rather than demonstrated behavior. Interiority relies on summary ("dread and exhilaration") instead of embodied reaction. The emotional arc is generic, lacking the specific contradictions or human particularity required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by diagnostic labels ("sympathetic skeptic," "courageously kind") rather than dramatized choice, and these traits do not constrain action or create cost. Her skepticism dissolves instantly upon touching the artifact, removing agency from the pivotal moment and leaving the character passive.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to discover what happens after goodbye") is stated directly rather than dramatized through nuanced interiority, leaving the character feeling like a vessel for the prompt's concepts. While the "bored immortal" archetype is consistent, the emotional landscape is abstract ("delicious, terrifying treason") and lacks specific, grounded human reactions to the prospect of non-existence. The internal conflict is low since the desire for the goal is absolute, reducing the complexity of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    Character motivation relies heavily on abstract summary ("motivation was simple yet complex") rather than dramatized struggle. While the final renunciation of the object is a strong character beat, the internal conflict is largely told through diagnostic labels rather than shown in the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("guardian of moments," "archivist of feeling") rather than dramatized choice. Silas faces no internal contradiction or difficult decision; his motivation is stated in exposition rather than tested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; his motivation ("discover the texture of memories") is abstract and lacks embodied urgency. Internal conflict is absent, replaced by diagnostic assertions of feeling ("insatiable need") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("gloomy cheerfulness") rather than embodied behavior. The emotional arc is tidy and linear, resolving complex internal conflict with a sudden, unearned epiphany. Elias accepts the magical functionality of his tools without the skepticism implied by his "myth buster" role, weakening the trait's impact on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara is defined by role labels ("culture shock absorber") and stated motivations rather than dramatic action. Her internal conflict ("dual allegiance") is summarized rather than demonstrated through difficult choices in a scene. The character feels like a functional vehicle for a synopsis, lacking visceral struggle or on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized, relying on exposition ("motivation burned bright") and label-like traits ("purposefully curious") instead of embodied action. The emotional connection to the ancestor feels asserted to satisfy a prompt requirement rather than woven into the character's immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elias is an archetype of the "saintly artisan" rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The portrayal of his blindness is fundamentally flawed; he is described as blind yet relies on visual cues (examining "refraction patterns" in water, seeing "warm glow"), which shatters character consistency. There is no emotional cost or difficult choice to define his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on expository telling and epithets ("the atlas editor," "a man whose dry wit..."). The required traits (wit, subtle confidence) are asserted as labels rather than dramatized through behavior or dialogue. There is no internal conflict or embodied struggle; Elias simply observes and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a cipher, functioning as a plot device rather than a character with interiority or conflicting impulses. Motivation is stated ("to rebuild what was lost") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance. The lack of struggle or flawed humanity makes the "cryptic" nature read as emptiness rather than mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is stated rather than felt; the protagonist's drive relies on the repeated label "override instinct" rather than embodied struggle. Internal conflict is minimal, as the character functions primarily as a vehicle to execute the prompt's checklist items without genuine emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias functions as a vessel for the prompt's legacy rather than a fully realized character, with motivation that hinges on a magical convenience rather than grounded emotional struggle. His decision to "chase hush" reads as mechanical prompt-fulfillment, and the lack of a difficult, non-magical trade-off limits the depth of his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character motivation is declared via exposition ("to repay a debt," "desire was a paradox") rather than dramatized through struggle or choice. The protagonist's internal state is labeled with oxymorons ("mournful elation") instead of embodied, and the botanist serves as a passive receptacle for the plot rather than an agent; his recognition of her is immediate and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but she encounters no meaningful internal or external resistance. Her journey is one of smooth intuition rather than struggle, lacking the "visible cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("motivation was a fragile thing," "guarded cynicism") rather than embodied emotion or choice under pressure. The protagonist faces no difficult decisions; she simply executes a plan without hesitation or conflicting impulses. Emotions are reported ("warmly curious sensation") rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by labels ("pseudonym creator," "carefully inventive") rather than embodied choices or struggle. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Elliot performs a routine without facing a dilemma or revealing character through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a stock "wise fool" archetype whose internal state is described through high-flown abstraction rather than grounded emotion or specific thought. He lacks internal conflict, knowing exactly what to do from the start, and his "disguise" is mentioned but logically impossible to dramatize as he is alone on stage.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist functions as a detached vehicle for the ritual rather than a character with genuine agency or risk; her motivation is abstract ("needed to understand") and lacks personal stakes. There is no internal conflict or dramatized struggle, leaving her role purely functional and the emotional arc unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is articulated through abstract metaphors rather than dramatized friction or behavioral contradictions. The connection with the child feels idealized and instantaneous, lacking the grit of genuine interaction. While the motivation is clear, the character's journey is a smooth glide to epiphany rather than a conflicted ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated ("rediscover lost joy") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. Elara’s emotional arc is linear—she wants, she acts, she succeeds—lacking the friction of genuine interiority or character-specific logic. The "pensive mirth" acts as a label rather than an embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a passive vessel for the story's lesson rather than an agent of change; she accepts the magical transition without struggle or skepticism. Her motivation is diagnosed by a mentor figure ("You seek to exchange certainty...") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("rogue scholar," "charming," "disheveled") rather than a specific individual; traits like "glint in his eye" are stock clichés. Motivation is declared ("guard the spark") rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice with visible personal cost. The emotional arc is summarized with labels ("Silas's blood went cold") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is passive, defined by labels ("shyly unstoppable") rather than choices made under pressure. Internal conflict is summarized ("hoarded for ages") rather than dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses or difficult decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated and drives the narrative, but their internal life relies on repeated labels ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied emotion. The sacrifice of memory is asserted in abstract terms ("felt a little emptier") without dramatizing the specific loss or confusion, reducing the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined almost exclusively by inserted labels (e.g., "carefully reckless") rather than behavior; her "recklessness" is stated but not demonstrated through a risky choice with consequences. The emotional resolution relies on a magical proxy rather than interpersonal vulnerability, leaving the central relationship abstract and the "trust" unearned on the page. The male character functions merely as a reward for the completion of the spell, lacking agency or distinct personality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist relies heavily on the prompt label "slyly heartfelt," which is repeated verbatim three times as a tell rather than demonstrated through behavior. The motivation ("encrypted compassion") remains abstract, and the internal conflict is resolved via a puzzle solution rather than a character-driven choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elian is clearly defined by his obsession, but his motivation and backstory are delivered via explicit summary ("To preserve them was his motivation") rather than dramatized choice. The "reinvented history" remains an abstract label rather than a visible constraint on behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    The character trait "featherly determined" is repeated three times as a static label (fingers, heart, smile) rather than being dramatized, creating a mechanical artifact. Elea lacks internal contradiction or distinct embodied desires; her final choice to remain feels like a default setting rather than a decision forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara serves as a functional vehicle for the prompt's checklist rather than a living character; her motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") remains an abstract label never tested by genuine opposition. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she moves from curiosity to mastery without error or cost. The arrival of the colleague, Kaelen, adds no status dynamic or pressure, rendering him a prop for the final tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is passive, functioning as an observer who processes data rather than an agent making difficult choices. The "cheerful gloom" is a reported label rather than an embodied emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions more as a device to execute the plot than a character with genuine interiority or conflict; his motivation is stated ("serenade monotony") rather than dramatized through struggle. The interaction with the woman lacks organic friction, reading as a staged collaboration without emotional stakes or risk of failure. There is no moment where his competence is tested or where he must choose between conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype with stated motivations ("Her motivation was to pen...") rather than a character with internal conflict. She faces no difficult choices; the transformation is a planned procedure executed without doubt or struggle. The emotional landscape is described with abstract labels ("absolute surrender") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is a passive observer defined by abstract labels rather than dramatic agency. Motivation is explicitly stated ("to illuminate value in the mundane") but never tested by pressure or conflict; he faces no obstacles and pays no price for his insights.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("trauma," "shame," "purpose") and summary rather than embodied action or contradictory impulses in scene. The protagonist functions as a vessel for the theme, resolving his internal conflict through a tidy, rational realization ("sudden clarity") rather than a dramatized struggle or difficult choice. The "topographic lines of trauma" description typifies the distance; we are told his history rather than feeling his specific, present-tense friction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is defined entirely by labels ("logical dreamer") and abstract goals rather than embodied traits or struggle. She faces no internal contradiction; her success is achieved through a friction-less ritual where she feels "peace and chaos" without paying an emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's defining trait, "sensitively perceptive," functions as a declared label rather than a dramatized capability with trade-offs; he simply touches things and receives information. The emotional pivot from fear to feeling "chosen" occurs instantly in summary, lacking the on-page struggle or cost required to earn such a significant shift. "Sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin" is told but not shown; the "ruin" is never manifested in behavior or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she performs a ritual with "perceptively calm purpose" that negates struggle. The "borrowed heartbeat" is an intriguing premise, but its cost was paid prior to the scene, leaving the on-page characterization static and functional rather than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies almost exclusively on abstract labels ("forever war peace negotiator," "operatively gentle") rather than dramatized behavior. Internal conflict is summarized ("negotiate with himself") but lacks an on-page struggle between contradictory impulses; the protagonist moves through the ritual without a credible moment of doubt or decision that tests his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("amoral philanthropist," "secretly sentimental") rather than demonstrated behavior. The interiority drifts into melodrama ("heart breaking for the thousandth time") instead of grounding the emotion in specific, conflicted nuances.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist reads as a thematic vessel ("paradox draped in silk") rather than a grounded character with specific desires. Internal conflict is resolved via magical proxy (threads) rather than difficult choices, and the emotional arc feels asserted by the narrator rather than earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("urbane," "serene") rather than dramatized interiority or struggle. His serenity acts as armor, preventing him from paying any emotional price for his choices; he moves from epiphany to execution without doubt or error. The shift from calligrapher to puppeteer feels like a prompt necessity rather than a character-driven evolution, and the lack of internal conflict renders him a flat vehicle for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elias functions as a vessel for the prompt’s themes rather than a dramatized character. He lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle; his motivation is stated in abstract terms ("believing in the profound truth of fleeting things") rather than revealed through high-stakes choices. The lack of emotional friction or potential for failure makes his "esoteric realism" a label rather than a lived trait.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's journey is linear and internal, lacking the friction of genuine cost or difficult choice. The motivation is declared via exposition ("motivation burned clear") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the emotional resolution—forgiving himself—feels instantaneous and unearned, relying on "therapy-speak" labels ("guilt dissolve like frost") rather than embodied change.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael is distinct but suffers from super-competence that flattens tension; his foresight allows him to bypass the physical threat (the spark) without struggle. The internal conflict is resolved via intellectual realization rather than emotional crucible. His "burden" is stated but executed with an ease ("precisely playful") that undermines the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elias is a static protagonist whose competence faces no genuine test; he begins and ends the story in the same state of confident mastery. The defining trait "frugal" exists as a label and a descriptor of tool usage ("practiced economy") but never forces a difficult trade-off or drives a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by static labels rather than choices under pressure; the "scheming" trait is asserted in exposition ("what began as scheming") but contradicted by his purely benevolent on-page actions. There is no internal conflict or active struggle, as the magical object performs all the emotional labor for the characters. The secondary characters are archetypal victims who overcome deep trauma instantly upon hearing music, lacking psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elian functions as a coherent archetype with a clear goal, but he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His motivation is stated ("sensing that its fractured nature held the key") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices or personal risk. The character remains a vehicle for the concept rather than a living presence with distinct emotional embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the character lacks internal contradiction or active struggle; emotion is summarized ("stubborn grin") rather than embodied in complex action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and label-based emotion ("bewildered," "determined") rather than dramatized reaction in a specific moment. The protagonist's internal state is explained to the reader ("realized each piece of fruit contained...") rather than shown through conflicted action or sensory embodiment. Motivation is stated but faces no significant on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype defined by her profession rather than a fully embodied character. Her motivation is stated ("desperate point") rather than felt through contradictory internal impulses or difficult micro-choices. The emotional connection to Kael is abstract ("physical ache") and does not complicate her decision-making process on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("chimera twin discoverer") rather than embodied personality or specific internal conflict. Emotions are reported ("heart aching," "resolve hardened") rather than dramatized through distinct behavior, and the "sacrifice" of identity feels devoid of actual loss or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elias lacks genuine agency or struggle; his "methodical" trait is bypassed by a convenient epiphany where he "suddenly knew" the language, rendering the climax unearned. There is no visible cost to his choice or a moment where his "adaptable" nature is tested by failure, making him feel like a plot device rather than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lorne is defined solely by his function; his motivation is a flat vector toward the goal with no internal conflict or doubt. Emotional experience is labeled ("peace," "calm") rather than embodied, and he undergoes no transformation or costly choice. The predecessor is mentioned to fabricate stakes that never materialize in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.4)
    Kaelen functions as a plot device rather than a character under pressure; his motivation is stated abstractly ("to prove that coincidences have meaning") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he proceeds with certainty throughout. The ending lacks an earned emotional cost or renunciation, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction that leaves his character arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character; his motivation is stated in abstract terms ("sculpt identity") rather than embodied through conflicting desires. The repeated use of the label "preemptively nostalgic" replaces genuine emotional interiority with a static tag, preventing any deepening of character state.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character motivation relies on diagnostic labels ("gravity of hopelessness") rather than embodied struggle. Marlo encounters no internal contradiction or resistance, and the "serious playfulness" trait is asserted but not demonstrated in choice or demeanor.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s internal state is consistent and observant, fitting the "chronicler" archetype, but functions more as a philosophical mouthpiece than a character under pressure. The emotional processing is intellectualized to the point where the visceral cost of the impending breakup feels dampened. There is little internal contradiction; the "tangential approach" creates a smoothness that prevents sharper, messier character work.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation is stated via exposition ("Motivation was singular") rather than dramatized through struggle. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, reading more as a vessel for the concept than a person making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.6)
    Elara lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her motivation is explicitly stated ("to teach silence how to comfort") rather than dramatized through struggle. She faces no difficult choice or potential for failure, making her a functional vehicle for the prompt rather than a character with agency. The lack of embodied cost or risk leaves her emotionally static.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear and the protagonist acts consistently with his role, but the internal landscape is flat. The "wisely adventurous" trait is applied as a label rather than dramatized through struggle or contradictory impulses, making the final choice feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s internal conflict is legible, balancing the protective urge of isolation against the risky necessity of connection. However, her motivation relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic metaphors ("intimacy was sometimes a form of consumption") rather than dramatized experience. While the final choice is earned, the "shadow keeper" identity feels more like a title than a lived role until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist acts as a passive vessel for the prompt's backstory, lacking internal contradiction, doubt, or genuine struggle. The transition from "survivor" to "diamond maker" is instant and uncomplicated by human flaw or hesitation, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("dynasty ender") and stated motivation ("burned sharper") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. His internal experience is rendered through abstract metaphors rather than specific, embodied emotion, and he faces no genuine internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict, and his transition from withdrawn to purposeful feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. Motivation is stated abstractly ("capture the shape of possibility") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or distinct character friction. The emotional arc is linear and devoid of the resistance required to make the final transformation resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined by emotive labels ("broken-hearted," "tactfully hopeful") rather than active, contradictory choices under pressure. His motivation is delivered through exposition ("simple, almost foolish") rather than dramatized struggle, leaving him as a passive vessel for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("carefully resourceful beyond measure," "underestimated rebel") rather than demonstrated behavior. While Maya's actions drive the plot, her interiority is summarized through abstract concepts ("cognitive erosion") rather than embodied emotion or specific personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a competent, stoic guardian whose motivation is clear, but he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene. His struggle is described as a "silent burden" and "worry" rather than dramatized through difficult choices or wavering resolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a passive protagonist whose primary action is defined by waiting for a calendar event and observing magic happen to him. His motivation is stated in exposition ("This belief fueled Elias's motivation") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal struggle. The transformation at the end feels unearned, as he pays no emotional or physical price for his new status.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("uncertainly certain") and explicit philosophical stances rather than dramatized friction. The central realization is delivered by a magical object rather than an earned internal struggle, resulting in a passive arc where the character observes rather than chooses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elian functions primarily as a vessel for the story’s themes rather than a breathing character; his grief is articulated through abstract metaphors ("heavier than lead," "shard of broken intention") rather than embodied behavior. The transition from the raw trauma of a disbanded search party to a settled philosophical acceptance happens too rapidly to feel earned, bypassing the messy reality of loss for a tidy resolution. While his motivation to find closure is clear, his internal state reads as a series of poetic labels rather than a genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher with no internal conflict or distinct personality beyond his role as a healer. His motivation is stated in abstract terms ("integrate laughter into healing") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance. The spirits appear as stock archetypes—the regretful woman, the lonely child—serving as passive vessels for the protagonist's unhindered success.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.3)
    Kael’s motivation ("discover the mathematics of mercy") is stated as an abstract concept rather than a lived drive, making the central conflict feel theoretical. The reliance on diagnostic labels (e.g., "proprioceptively enhanced") to define his internal state creates distance, and the final epiphany feels like an intellectual calculation rather than a character turn earned through emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions as a passive vessel for the theme. Her "struggle" is resolved instantly by intuition without genuine doubt or error. The motivation ("honoring overlooked histories") is stated as a noble label rather than dramatized through choices with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a procedural device than a fully realized character. His motivation ("seek what ceilings hide") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. The emotional arc is static; the "burden" he carries is described as "weightless" and familiar, resulting in a lack of internal stakes or felt cost during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer whose shift from order to chaos is tracked, though his motivation is delivered via exposition ("clicked into place") rather than deep dramatic friction. The choice to pull the lever feels earned by the immediate pressure of the frost warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen is a distinct presence with a clear, lyrical worldview, but his motivation relies heavily on explicit labeling ("poetically inclined") rather than embodied action until the final beat. The connection between his revolutionary past and the museum theft is thematic but lacks visceral urgency in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions as a static archetype of competence, executing a procedure without internal conflict, doubt, or personal cost. Motivation is stated ("motivation burned clear") rather than tested by pressure, resulting in a character who faces no genuine dilemma or emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the narrative from the "ailment" to the resolution. The shift from hoarding traces (vials) to seeking the source is a well-motivated internal arc that earns the final renunciation. Elias's specific sensory obsession provides a unique and grounded interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("perpetually learning," "spirit") rather than embodied traits or choices. Her reaction to a life-threatening storm is "serene," which flattens the emotional reality and removes any sense of struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and stated traits ("quietly driven," "fixation grew") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. Lena functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a living agent; her "reckoning" is an internal realization described in abstract terms rather than a contested action in a specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined almost entirely by adjectives ("solemn," "precise") rather than choices or internal contradictions. His motivation is a role-based label ("civil-rights archivist") that propels him mechanically through the plot without personal stakes or hesitation. The emotional arc is asserted through summary ("seared into his soul") rather than dramatized through behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is asserted via label ("rejects false comfort") rather than dramatized through struggle; the protagonist's internal conflict is intellectual and resolves without emotional cost. The ending rewards him with total success for a "balance" compromise, undercutting the stated rejection of easy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct presence with well-rendered interiority, but his pivotal choice relies on "instinct" rather than a dramatized struggle between competing values. The transition from archivist to living vessel happens too smoothly, reducing the felt cost of his sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype ("Seed Saver") rather than a specific individual. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("heat of purpose," "furiously tranquil") rather than embodied emotion or conflicted micro-choices. The oxymoronic trait is stated as a definition rather than dramatized through behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian is a competent archetype without internal contradiction or struggle. His "humble" nature and "curiosity" are delivered via exposition labels rather than dramatized behavior. The narrative lacks a moment where his competence is genuinely tested or where he must choose between conflicting desires; he simply performs his job perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious by nature") rather than dramatized attributes or contradictory impulses. Elara lacks interior conflict or specific micro-choices; she functions as a passive vehicle for the premise rather than a living agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elisha acts as a passive functionary who resolves the central conflict through competence rather than struggle; his "astonishment" is a label that contradicts his "tranquilly perceptive" demeanor. He faces no dilemma, internal friction, or cost, making him feel like a plot device rather than a living character making hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to understand the texture of time passing") remains abstract and label-heavy rather than embodied in specific desires. His agency is undermined by the central plot revelation—that he had been unconsciously creating the code for years—which replaces active decision-making with narrative convenience. The internal "borrowed time" condition is stated but does not force a visible trade-off or behavioral change under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype without internal contradiction; emotions are labeled ("heart quietly full") rather than embodied in difficult choices. The "lifelong pursuit" is asserted in exposition rather than tested by genuine struggle or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on summary labels ("peculiar kind of peace," "brazen calm") rather than embodied reactions to the diagnosis in a specific moment. The rapid movement through time prevents the display of internal contradiction or difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined by heavy labels ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious") rather than dramatized traits. His transformation from skeptic to believer is instantaneous upon interacting with the artifact, lacking the internal struggle or "felt cost" required for an earned arc. The skepticism is stated but offers no genuine resistance to the plot's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype functioning as a delivery mechanism for the plot, lacking internal conflict or specific, embodied emotion. His motivation is stated via abstract labels ("hollow in his ancient heart") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses. There is no resistance to his actions, leaving his agency untested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is competent but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; his "intuitively descriptive mind" is told via label rather than shown through struggle. The motivation is clear but the emotional stakes are asserted rather than dramatized in the scene's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated via narration ("His motivation... was to turn the confusion...") rather than dramatized through friction. The emotional pivot—seeing a timeline where his family might survive yet reacting with clinical cartographic purpose rather than grief—feels psychologically convenient and lacks visceral cost. Interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("alchemizing into purpose") rather than embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character motivation is declared via labels ("chivalrous thief," "cherished abandon") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or behavior. The emotional arc of leaving the mentor is summarized in exposition ("letting go of the man") rather than dramatized with visible hesitation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is defined almost exclusively by abstract labels ("historian of small gestures," "nomadic penumbra") and backstory summaries rather than present-tense choices. Her emotional state is declared ("composed," "reverence") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or behavior. She functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies on generic somatic markers ("chest tightening painfully") and abstract labels for emotion ("memories too sharp to endure"). The character reads as an archetype whose mastery arrives via convenient magical aptitude rather than dramatized struggle or specific psychological particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but stated rather than felt; we are told of his "guilt-ridden heart" rather than seeing it distort his choices. The required trait "fidgets productively" is applied as a verbatim label twice, feeling mechanical rather than like an organic habit. The emotional resolution—guilt simply vanishing after a realization—feels unearned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on static labels like "innocently mischievous" and "defiant" rather than demonstrated behavior, flattening the protagonist into a trope. The internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized; Elaran's transition from curiosity to grave responsibility feels unearned because the struggle is told, not shown in scene. The repeated adverbial clustering ("naturally innocently mischievous") distances the reader from his actual interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's "uncertainty" exists only as a label; his actions (narrating history with specific dates, performing magic) display total competence and authority. There is no internal conflict or hesitation in the scene to dramatize the trait. The "unwavering belief" cited in the text contradicts the core descriptor without earning the shift through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's motivation ("promise to find something that couldn't be broken") is clearly stated but relies heavily on retrospective summary rather than dramatized pressure. Interiority tends toward diagnostic labeling (e.g., "intimately aloof," "betrayed him") rather than embodied emotion, distancing the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a focused, consistent focalizer with a clear, specific internal landscape. The motivation is well-established, but the isolation renders the "test" purely theoretical until the end; without interpersonal friction or a distinct moment of doubt, the success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, and the pivotal choice to ignore the phone demonstrates agency. However, interiority often relies on diagnostic labels ("loss was a place," "grief had its own logic") rather than embodied emotion, distancing the reader from his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict between her rational self-image and her involuntary emotional exposure is compelling and embodied. The "rational truffle forager" attribute feels slightly inserted as a label rather than fully demonstrated through unique tactical choices, but her dread and subsequent decision are well-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hemlock is a consistent, established focalizer, but his agency is undercut by the magical "gift" which solves the central mystery for him passively. His motivation is reactive ("pull of the flower") rather than active desire, and his empathy, while noble, feels immediate and unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is largely passive, propelled by magical prompts (a glowing chip, guiding ants) rather than internal drive. His defining attribute, an "empirically intuitive mind," is contradicted by his willingness to follow insects based on a warm trinket without empirical interrogation. The emotional arc is resolved by a magical room explaining his own feelings to him, rather than through earned character work.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies on stock tropes ("disenchanted queen," "shadowed eyes") rather than embodied complexity. The pivotal realization is an unearned epiphany ("suddenly coalesced into understanding") that dissolves the central conflict without genuine struggle or choice-making. The "softly commanding" trait appears only as a repeated label rather than a demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a competent vessel for the magic system rather than a fully realized character; her "scientifically romantic" nature is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through conflicting choices. While she succeeds, her journey lacks internal resistance or distinct micro-choices; the "terrifying" weight of the secret is asserted but not felt in her reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character emotion is conveyed through diagnostic labels ("jaded wonder," "feral nostalgia") rather than embodied experience or action. The internal conflict is resolved via summary assertion ("Tonight would be different") rather than a dramatized psychological struggle or earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's internal state is legible, but the resolution relies on a "soft reset" of her disability (the return of smell) triggered by an epiphany rather than a costly choice. The emotional arc feels unearned, transitioning from grief to "hope" via a single convenient realization ("pain into purpose") without checking the character's blind spots or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is deep and economical; Aeris's internal conflict between scholarly rigidity and the "nonsense" of memory drives the narrative. The physical transformation is mirrored by an emotional pivot, earning the resolution through a clear micro-choice to abandon logic for a child's prayer. The cost is visibly paid in the permanent alteration of his hand.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist faces no interpersonal resistance; the ghost yields immediately upon contact, removing the potential for a "relationship as crucible." The dialogue relies on stock phrases ("You were just a girl") that resolve a century of estrangement without earning the emotional shift through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist acts as a cipher for the prompt's metaphysical concepts rather than a fully realized character. There is no dramatized internal conflict or specific emotional texture; the "sacrifice of certainty" is stated as a philosophical necessity rather than felt as a personal loss on the page. The witness functions purely as an avatar to advance the ritual, lacking distinct human (or post-human) interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene’s central action (investigation). However, the character functions largely as a vessel for philosophical observation rather than an embodied individual facing conflicting impulses; the "eminently peculiar" trait remains a told label rather than a demonstrated behavior affecting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characters function as thematic mouthpieces rather than distinct individuals, engaging in "diagnostic label-speak" ("You’re trying to revolutionize how we perceive boundaries") rather than natural dialogue. The immediate emotional alignment eliminates necessary interpersonal friction, leaving relationship dynamics static and devoid of genuine status shifts. Motivation is stated abstractly ("physics of letting go") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    The father’s immediate emotional conversion upon reading the notebook lacks psychological realism and resistance, reducing him to a prop for the protagonist's lesson. Elara's "compulsive gambler" trait is applied as a label but contradicts her calculated, low-risk behavior in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is presented through a summary of habits rather than a dramatized scene, leaving him distant. While his backstory and internal state are described, there is no "now" moment where he faces a specific, high-pressure choice that reveals character in action. He exists as a static figure in a routine rather than an agent navigating a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.1)
    Character motivation is stated rather than dramatized ("Elias believed," "he whispered to himself"). Emotional states are handled via diagnostic labeling ("haunted euphoria," "ache of absence") rather than embodied experience. The internal shift is summarized in the narrative rather than shown through a struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear and the internal arc tracks, but the characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("desperate jocular mask," "polite anarchy") rather than fully dramatized behavior. The ending shifts into explanatory introspection ("He realized then what the point... was"), flattening the emotional peak with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a vessel for the concept rather than a realized character; his "storm in the soul" is labeled rather than dramatized. He faces no difficult choices or contradictions, only a linear path of acceptance. The epiphany at the end feels unearned by prior struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is broadly clear, but interiority relies on abstract summary ("felt the weight of the loss") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulse. The protagonist functions primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's philosophy, and the "confidently uncertain" trait appears as a label rather than a driver of difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("bittersweet joy," "sorrow of loss") rather than embodied emotion or action. The relationship lacks friction or status dynamics; Lyra and Julian act as a single unit without distinct internal lives or contradictory impulses. The motivation ("make them remember") remains abstract and ungrounded in specific stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("analytically intuitive," "volcanic tenderness") rather than embodied action or specific interiority. The protagonist's journey is summarized rather than dramatized, lacking the micro-choices and internal conflict required to earn the emotional shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.0)
    Kael lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle; his competence is absolute, reducing the narrative to a demonstration rather than a story. Jenna functions solely as a strawman to be proven wrong, offering no meaningful opposition or relational pressure. The protagonist’s "obsession" is stated but not dramatized through costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    The guardian functions as a static archetype rather than a character, lacking internal conflict, contradictions, or personal cost. The emotional resolution relies on Anna serving as a prop for the guardian's wisdom, with her grief resolving via magical intervention rather than agency or struggle. The trait "spiralingly calm" appears as a forced label rather than a dramatized behavior that shapes outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Arthur functions more as a static archetype (the wise, benevolent guide) than a protagonist under pressure; while his interiority is accessible, he faces no difficult choices, internal contradictions, or personal risks in the scene, resulting in a flat character arc despite the high concept.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("longing," "guarded cage," "desperate") rather than embodied emotion or specific memory. The transformation is asserted via list-making ("dock worker, pirate, island, whale") rather than demonstrated through a complex behavioral shift.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is consistent and the central trait (performing blankness) drives the scene. However, the required "moral ambiguity" is applied as a label in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs; Elara reads as a standard resistance hero, not ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("cloud-shadow poet," "aesthetically driven") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Kael faces no internal conflict or genuine doubt; his transformation into a "master" is an unearned apotheosis without a visible personal cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)

Leo lacks internal contradiction and operates as a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a conflicted agent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic vessel rather than a living character; they lack internal contradiction, flaws, or distinct personality traits beyond a generalized "soothing" nature. The emotional arc is linear and unearned, with no visible cost paid for the epiphany. The repeated label "powerfully gentle" substitutes for dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elian functions as a static vessel for backstory and exposition rather than a character making high-stakes choices under pressure. We are told of his grief and motivation in summary, but there is no dramatized scene where his interiority conflicts with a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on inserted labels ("steadily curious") rather than demonstrated traits tested by pressure. Elara faces no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her interaction with the mentor lacks status dynamics or friction, rendering her a passive vehicle for the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character; her motivation ("pursue forbidden knowledge") is stated in exposition but never tested by a difficult choice.

She succeeds through stated competence ("careful practice") rather than struggle, leaving her arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a cipher defined by labels ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") rather than a character with internal contradictions or genuine struggle. Her emotions are reported via abstract phrases like "luminous regret" rather than embodied in action or visceral reaction. The repetition of her epithet creates a robotic distance, preventing any deep connection or psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maria’s internal logic is consistent, and her gentle methodology informs her choices well. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("fragile convictions," "compassion") rather than visceral, embodied emotion. The dialogue functions primarily to externalize her internal debate rather than create genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maya changes her entire worldview instantly upon hearing the plants, lacking genuine internal struggle or resistance. Her emotions are reported via physical clichés ("tears in her eyes") rather than embodied in the narration.

    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the premise; the emotional resolution ("strange and powerful peace") relies on summary labels rather than dramatized processing or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies on poetic labels ("moonstruck dreamer") and abstract summaries of internal states rather than dramatized struggle. The motivation to "free creativity" is stated explicitly, but the fear mentioned is never felt as a resisting force in the moment, making her compliance with the stars feel automatic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is functionally competent but lacks internal friction or contradiction; the "dreamless" trait serves as a mechanical key rather than a source of psychological depth. His motivation is clear but static, leading to a character who executes a task rather than grappling with a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; the journey is a frictionless procession to success. Critical continuity failure: the protagonist’s name drifts from Elian to Elias to Elliot, shattering character coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The characters function as archetypes in a fable rather than individuals with specific interiority; the traveler is a passive "shadowy figure" who merely follows instructions until the final paragraph. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; the "wise" guides speak in thematic platitudes rather than reacting to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistent, but motivation is delivered via direct exposition ("The bellhop’s motivation was simple: to understand...") rather than emerging from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael is an archetype rather than a character, defined by static labels ("regally unpretentious," "immense lineage") rather than contradictory desires or difficult choices. He faces no internal struggle or doubt; his victory is pre-assured, and he pays no personal cost during the confrontation. The "diminutive titan" trait remains an aesthetic descriptor rather than a physical constraint that shapes his tactics in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is stated as an abstract philosophical desire ("to discover why some paths disappear") rather than a concrete want, leading to a heady, low-stakes interiority. The protagonist’s shift from caretaker to leaving feels like an abrupt authorial pivot rather than an earned character arc driven by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)

    Maeva functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex individual; her "insurgent spirit" is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.7)
    Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("somatic markers," "integrating") which distances the reader from embodied emotion. The character follows a linear, therapeutic progression without the internal contradictions or difficult choices that create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract emotional labels ("crestfallen," "unraveling") rather than embodied behaviors or specific desires. The transformation from broken to "remade" is unearned by the internal struggle, relying on a sudden "whisper" of insight rather than a hard choice between conflicting values. The character feels more like a vessel for the prompt's metaphors than a distinct individual with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stated as a "quiet obsession" rather than dramatized through urgent struggle, and his "anger" is labeled without a visible source or behavioral manifestation. He functions as a passive observer of an experiment rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure. The "tracker" identity and "albino" trait appear as ornamental tags that do not shape his tactics or perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic labels ("bravely conflicted mind," "bravely conflicted soul," "bravely conflicted heart") repeated verbatim rather than dramatized behavior. There is no internal struggle or contradictory impulse shown; the protagonist executes the plot without hesitation or specific, embodied interiority. The emotional arc is summarized through generic physical tells ("heart raced," "palm sweat").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara is a bundle of summarized traits and stated motivations rather than an agent making choices under pressure. Her internal state is described through exposition ("Elara had learned to navigate," "Her motivation... drove every choice") rather than dramatized through action or difficult decisions in the scene. The "contradictions" of her nature are asserted but never tested by a concrete conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by competence rather than vulnerability, functioning as a "cool-headed" operator who is explicitly "impervious" to the setting's pressures.

The character arrives, executes a ritual without error, and leaves, lacking the friction or human cost required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stated clearly, but her traits rely on labels ("devotedly observant," "solemn playfulness") rather than dramatized behavior. The primary trait is "told" to justify a plot convenience (finding the map), and the "playfulness" contradicts the grave, methodical tone of her actions in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orion’s motivation—resolving guilt over his daughter—is clear and poignant, but the resolution feels unearned by his agency. His emotional arc relies heavily on the convenient discovery of his own voice in the amber rather than an internal struggle or active choice that forces him to confront his loss without a magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on telling via labels ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's "socially perceptive" nature is inexplicably used to decode physical magic in a solitary cave, reading as a prompt insertion rather than an organic trait.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara is defined almost exclusively by contradictory abstract labels ("gentle radical," "soft and unyielding") rather than dramatized choices. Her internal state is described through the prompt's provided motivation phrases without translating them into specific, embodied psychological pressure. The character reads as a vehicle for the prompt's terms rather than a living person navigating a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)

    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("affectionate skeptic," "nature") rather than dramatized behavior; the protagonist accepts the premise immediately without the stated skepticism acting as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara’s motivation is declared via exposition ("gnawed at her purpose") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal contradiction.

The protagonist faces no genuine internal resistance, moving from desire to fulfillment without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara functions as a role rather than a character, lacking internal contradiction, specific desire beyond the prompt's mandate, or embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is constructed from genre tropes ("burned spy," "broken") rather than specific, embodied traits.

    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his motivation is stated via exposition ("His motivation was simple") rather than dramatized through struggle.

The protagonist's shift to "self-reliance" feels unearned, appearing as a declared state change rather than a result of psychological struggle or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias is a passive protagonist who follows a "silent instruction" rather than making difficult choices. His motivation is abstract (finding a "thread"), and he lacks the contradictory impulses or on-page struggle required for depth; the internal change is an unearned realization rather than a result of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a competent problem-solver but lacks internal contradiction or embodied cost; her emotional state is delivered via summary labels ("increasingly isolated," "cautiously hopeful") rather than dramatized reaction. The protagonist faces no genuine dilemma, merely a technical hurdle, resulting in a flat character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies entirely on the verbatim repetition of the label "claustrophobic explorer" rather than embodied behavior or specific interiority. The protagonist lacks agency beyond executing a pre-determined ritual; her fear is stated but not felt through sensory experience or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is defined clearly by his condition and role, but he lacks internal conflict or a moment of difficult choice. The narrative tells us his motivation ("awaken dormant empathy") rather than letting it emerge through a struggle against resistance; his actions are procedural and smooth, lacking the friction required to reveal character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation to honor his ancestor is clear and drives the plot, but his interiority is flattened by the repetitive use of the diagnostic label "nervously confident" instead of embodied emotion. This reliance on telling rather than showing creates a distance that prevents the high-stakes choice from feeling fully visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on prompt labels ("dynamically observant") rather than demonstrated traits. Motivation is explicitly stated ("sculpt possibility...") rather than dramatized through struggle or desire. The protagonist observes and reacts but faces no genuine internal contradiction or costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Jasper is a coherent focalizer with a distinct worldview, but the "synopsis mode" required to cover the timeframe forces his key choices (investing, leaving) to be summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. His "polished calm" risks reading as passivity; we are told he is calm rather than seeing the internal struggle to maintain it during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on exposition ("always been able to recall," "words had always carried") rather than action. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or flaws, and the "healing" ability functions as an unearned plot device that instantly resolves the antagonist's resistance without emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("guarded," "wilderness wisdom," "guilt") rather than dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on labels ("reckless idealist") that contradict the on-page action, which is methodical and careful. Elian faces no significant internal opposition or doubt; his emotional arc is a linear progression from determination to satisfaction without the messiness of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling rather than dramatization ("insulating emotionally with facts," "confidently uncertain"). The epiphany is intellectualized and immediate upon seeing the object, lacking the necessary struggle or contradictory impulses to make the emotional shift earn its weight. The transition from numbness to resolve feels sketched rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("kindly methodical nature," "haunted ambitions") rather than demonstrating these traits through contested choices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a camera rather than a character with conflicting desires; she observes and documents but makes no difficult choices. The "cautious exuberance" is stated as a label rather than embodied in action, and her final realization feels intellectual rather than visceral. There is no cost paid for the knowledge, and her acceptance of the veil renders her static.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation ("weigh a dream") is declared in dialogue rather than dramatized through difficult hesitation or visible cost. The backstory dump about the neural stimulator accident interrupts the present action and feels like a convenient patch to justify the telepathy prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is a static archetype (the serene professional) whose competence precludes struggle. Her interiority is delivered through abstract summaries ("motivation burned bright") rather than embodied reactions or difficult choices, resulting in a lack of character friction or growth.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on archetypes (the cryptically wise master, the patient apprentice) rather than specific, grounded interiority. Elara’s mastery arrives without a dramatized struggle or personal cost, making her arc feel like a procedural level-up rather than a human transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael is a consistent focalizer with a distinct, if esoteric, worldview. However, the characterization relies heavily on expository telling ("His motivation was singular," "He was historically reverent") rather than behavior dramatized in scene. The internal struggle is largely abstract; while his competence is established, we see little of the specific human cost or contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is explicitly told ("remained simple: to find...") rather than dramatized through struggle or hard choices. The protagonist faces no internal contradiction or genuine flaw; he is simply correct from start to finish, and the "underachiever" label feels unearned given his effortless mastery of ancient arts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive") rather than embodied complexity shown through action. The "brittle" nature of his devotion is stated in exposition but not tested by a pressure that threatens to break it.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is fundamentally confused by diction errors; the text claims his mission is to "expunge the past" while his actions (placing photos) aim to preserve it. This logical contradiction makes the "burden he chose" unintelligible. The internal conflict is stated in exposition ("driven by a need") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is competent and graceful, but her internal state lacks genuine conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. The "secret sentimentality" is stated as a trait but does not force a difficult choice or create drag against her logic; she succeeds without visible struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("attentively inventive") and stated motivations ("preserve trust") rather than specific, embodied desires or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    Character interiority relies heavily on abstract diagnostic labels ("numbness," "ego death," "grief") rather than specific, embodied micro-behaviors.

While the motivation is clear, the emotional arc feels summarized rather than dramatized through the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but his sudden, certain identification of the "corpse flower" seed lacks dramatized evidence, reading as authorial insertion rather than character competence. The shift from "storms of his mind" to "profound quietude" is asserted rather than earned through struggle, making the internal arc feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct, high-concept figure, but his internal landscape is often summarized ("mournfully eager") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The emotional trajectory is linear—desire leads directly to action and success—lacking the complexity of doubt or the cost of a difficult micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's labeled trait ("feral") contradicts his on-page behavior, which is monastic, motionless, and gentle; the discrepancy is never addressed. Motivation is explicitly stated as a mantra ("make friends with uncertainty") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or struggle. The climax relies on the character simply remembering this motivation rather than making a difficult, character-defining choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's internal journey is clear, but characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("hopeless," "destiny") rather than embodied behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a fully realized character; his internal struggle is summarized ("discarding assumptions") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficulty.

The realization comes too easily, with no distinct blind spots or character-specific flaws complicating the process.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle; his "resilient positivity" is a repeated label rather than a dramatized trait tested by pressure. He functions as a plot device to push buttons rather than a character making difficult choices with visible costs. The shift from deckhand to timeline-merger happens without emotional weight or earned competence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Siran acts as a functional protagonist, but his internal arc relies on a sudden, diagnostic epiphany rather than earned struggle. The transition from seeking precision to embracing "abandon" happens instantaneously after a single failure, lacking the resistance or contradictory impulses that define deep characterization. The realization is articulated in abstract terms ("connection... about letting them breathe") rather than dramatized through prolonged conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias functions primarily as a delivery vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character under pressure. The attribute "balancedly curious" is applied as a static label twice rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. While his internal melancholy is established, his emotional arc is one of observation rather than active struggle or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on explicit labels ("persistently curious") rather than dramatized traits or difficult choices. Aria faces no internal conflict or contradictory impulses, proceeding linearly to success without personal cost. The emotional arc is told through summary ("familiar pull," "profound gratitude") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is passive; her defining trait (claustrophobia) is introduced only to be immediately negated ("paradoxically free"), removing potential internal conflict. Motivation is supplied via exposition (mentor's notes) rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices on the page. The transformation at the end feels unearned because the character pays no emotional price and overcomes no resistance to get there.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer, and his interaction with the ghost shows clear, albeit gentle, agency (tapping the shard to disrupt patterns). However, his internal landscape lacks contradictory impulses; his motivation is explicitly stated ("seeking wisdom") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires, resulting in a somewhat flat emotional trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kaelen acts as a vessel for a pre-ordained ritual rather than a character making difficult choices; the "dream" revelation removes agency and discovery. Motivation is stated ("translate texture into sound") but lacks the friction of internal conflict or the risk of failure required to test character.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is distinctly drawn, blending professional cover with personal grief. The shift from rage to acceptance feels slightly assisted by the creature's "influence" (fizzing like seltzer), which dampens the agency of his emotional pivot, but the final renunciation (dropping the arrow) restores active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist functions as a mythic archetype rather than a psychologically realized individual; her journey from grief to hope is asserted through abstract narration rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. There is no genuine internal opposition or flawed decision-making; her actions are uniformly "correct" and heroic, lacking the friction of human error or specific personality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael is a competent agent whose specific internal motivation ("broken promises") effectively drives the plot, even if phrased somewhat poetically. His "respectfully rebellious" nature is dramatized well through the meticulous subversion of the rules rather than open defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is passive; the pivotal transformation is granted by a magical object ("halo fragment") rather than earned through agency or struggle. Motivation shifts abruptly from scavenging to singing without an on-page internal conflict or decision process. The character functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's required resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist serves as a functional avatar rather than a living character; her "sanely eccentric" nature is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through contradictory choices or social friction. Motivation is stated explicitly ("mission was singular") but lacks visceral stakes or the possibility of failure. There is no internal struggle; she performs the ritual perfectly without doubt or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a generic archetype (the magical craftsman) with no dramatized internal conflict, contradictions, or distinct personality traits. His success is immediate and lacks the friction of genuine struggle or difficult choices; he simply performs a ritual that works perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The locksmith acts as a functional archetype—a competent craftsman with no internal conflict, personal stakes, or flaws that jeopardize the outcome. His interiority is limited to procedural observation, and the absence of a challenge to his worldview leaves him feeling like a plot device rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara lacks internal resistance; she accepts the life-altering alien revelation instantly ("didn't flinch") without the emotional friction or cost expected of a decades-long mystery. Her transition from accuser ("You took something") to willing collaborator is too smooth, missing the necessary psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex individual; her "backward walking" reads as an assigned quirk rather than an embodied nervous reaction. The lack of genuine internal conflict or possibility of failure flattens the emotional arc. The prompt label "combative tenderness" is stated rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her "unwavering resolve" is stated rather than tested by the narrative. Characterization relies on abstract labels ("insatiably creative," "wise") that are not dramatized through difficult choices or distinct behavior. The emotional arc is flat, moving from certainty to satisfaction without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s internal arc resolves through a legible conceptual repricing, but the realization feels more thematic than earned by deep on-page struggle. Anna functions solely as an exposition delivery device rather than a fully realized character, and Elias's emotions are often told via labels ("lucid unrest") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist is defined by diagnostic labels ("perceptive," "methodically curious") rather than dramatized behavior, resulting in a lack of interiority or genuine struggle. He faces no difficult choices or internal contradictions; his journey is a linear procedural execution that requires no personal cost or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Character motivation is clear, but the epiphany is delivered through exposition ("struck Elias like a wave") rather than subtextual action. The dialogue with Death feels functional and slightly expository, reducing the sense of genuine relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a passive conduit for the prompt's requirements rather than a character with internal contradictions or agency. His motivation is explicitly stated ("simple yet profound") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or behavior. There is no emotional cost or significant internal struggle; he simply performs a task perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is a passive vessel for a pre-arranged destiny rather than an agent of change. Her primary trait ("warmly inquisitive") is an inserted label that does not drive a difficult choice or cost; she succeeds because the Master paved the way, not because she overcame internal contradiction or external pressure. The "anticipation and dread" pairing is a standard emotional heuristic that never deepens into specific, embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; his reaction to a life-threatening cable snap is purely philosophical, devoid of survival instinct or visceral fear. Internal conflict is replaced by abstract musing ("prove that empty spaces remember"), and there are no difficult micro-choices under pressure, only passive observation. The character remains an archetype of the "poetic observer" without distinct personality or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated, and the face blindness functions as a thematic engine. However, the emotional arc relies on abstract assertions of feeling "seen" rather than dramatized interpersonal or internal struggle. The shift from "curse" to "canvas" feels unearned by the brief action on page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on assertion rather than dramatization; Elias is described as "diligently curious" with "unshakeable motivation," but these are labels, not drivers of conflict. He faces no internal struggle, contradictory impulses, or genuine risk; his success is instantaneous and inevitable, lacking the friction or cost required for literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist acts as a cipher whose internal arc is summarized via diagnostic labels ("fixing herself") rather than dramatized through choice. The moment of emotional release ("tears froze") attempts embodiment but lacks a specific, costly decision to earn the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a collective protagonist ("the settlers," "the community") rather than a focal character with specific interiority or contradictory impulses. Elara and Kael appear as named functions rather than fully realized individuals, and no character faces a micro-choice with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist serves as a passive vessel for the concept rather than a character with agency or internal friction; his motivation is declared ("knew it was simple") rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tomas is a compelling, burdened figure with clear competence and motivation. The mention of "morning sickness" is disorienting—unclear if a literal biological cost or a clumsy metaphor—and momentarily confuses the character's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("symphonically minded") and stated motivation ("to atone") rather than dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses. The protagonist functions as a vessel for the plot's solution, experiencing a convenient internal shift that resolves the conflict without the necessary emotional cost or behavioral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions as a passive device rather than an active protagonist; he faces no resistance and makes no difficult choices in the scene. His stated motivation (finding where stories begin) is disconnected from his on-page actions, and his satisfaction at the end feels unearned because it follows no struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but the internal conflict is resolved via a magical external fix rather than a psychological crucible. The specific memories of his parents appear somewhat late to justify the climax, and the emotional contagion trait is stated but not dramatized as an active interpersonal complication.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is an idealized figure of competence who faces no internal contradiction, doubt, or active struggle on the page. Her "empathetically decisive" nature is established through labels rather than dramatized choices, resulting in a flat character arc with no visible cost or growth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist lacks genuine agency or internal conflict, functioning as a vehicle for the prompt’s concepts rather than a person making difficult choices under pressure.

The lack of a visible cost or flaw reduces the character to a competent archetype without depth.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a linear execution of competence without doubt or struggle.

The character remains static, ending exactly as she began but with more inventory.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.2)
    Eliara functions as a vessel for the prompt rather than a character; her motivation is summarized ("motive burned bright") rather than dramatized through conflict or difficult choices. There is no internal contradiction, and her success comes without personal cost or risk, leaving her flat and purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("thoughtfully precise") and abstract summary of emotion ("Powerful emotions rose within him") rather than embodied experience.

The internal arc feels unearned because the struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on costume details ("mismatched socks," "peace symbols") and explicit labels ("eclectic pacifist") rather than demonstrated traits. The internal landscape is described via "diagnostic label-speak" (e.g., "intuitively descriptive mind") rather than embodied emotion, and the protagonist's primary choice is a technobabble solution rather than a decision with personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is a static archetype of wisdom rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradictions or genuine obstacles. Her motivation ("serenity within motion") is abstract and stated via diagnostic label-speak rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices. The lack of a flaw or blind spot makes her trajectory linear and devoid of earned emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("rapidly adapting mind") rather than dramatized behavior.

No meaningful micro-choices reveal depth beyond the procedural role.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the concept rather than a living character; their motivation ("to certify wonder") is abstract and lacks human grounding. There is no internal conflict, contradiction, or moment of doubt to give the agency weight. The bell ringer faces no resistance and pays no emotional price, making the "success" feel inevitable and unearned. The "synesthetic gift" serves as a descriptor list rather than a lens that complicates choices or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist's motivation to harvest insight is clear, but the internal transformation is summarized rather than dramatized. The pivotal realization—that rigidity caused the failure—arrives as an abstract conclusion ("Understanding came gradually") rather than a visceral reaction to a specific, on-page stimulus or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.6)
    Silas functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character with agency; his trait of borrowing personalities is described via adverbs rather than dramatized in voice or choice. The ending explicitly negates the cost of assimilation by stating his individuality persisted, robbing the climax of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined largely by the label "jittery" and a summary of his internal state rather than dramatized choices under pressure.

The character acts as a passive vessel for the prompt's themes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by his role ("attentive mystic") and a static desire for validation, lacking internal contradiction or emotional risk.

He begins and ends in the same psychological state, merely reinforced, resulting in a flat trajectory with no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's required descriptors ("wistful," "resolve") rather than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by abstract labels ("meek," "quietly determined") rather than dramatized behavior or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian is a coherent focalizer with clear motivation, but he lacks the internal contradiction or messiness required for higher bands.

The resolution feels intellectual rather than visceral; the heart's "resonance" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated ("to discover") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or sacrifice. The protagonist observes and learns in summary rather than acting under immediate pressure, resulting in a passive narrative arc lacking embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is clearly defined, but the characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("keenly empathetic nature," "trauma recovery," "regressed dramatically") rather than embodied interaction.

The protagonist functions as a plot device to execute the prompt's checklist rather than a living presence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara's skepticism is introduced as a label ("luminous skeptic") but offers no resistance in the scene; she accepts the mystical convergence immediately, rendering the internal conflict nominal.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a compelling internal landscape, though the "prophet" label feels more like a stylistic moniker than a dramatized role.

Elijah faces no genuine dilemma or cost; his emotional calibration is perfect, reducing him to a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a person under pressure. The transition in Mr. Hale’s character is summarized ("decline had softened his edges") rather than dramatized in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but her internal landscape is sketched with generic markers ("heart hammered," "resolve quietly deliberate") rather than specific, contradictory impulses. The label "budding rune scholar" feels inserted rather than demonstrated through a struggle with the material; she masters the ancient tech too easily. The realization at the end is intellectual but lacks a deeply felt personal cost or specific emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.5)
    Eleanor is defined primarily by retrospective labels ("forgiving skeptic," "shrewdly innocent") rather than active resistance in the scene. Her skepticism is stated in the prompt but absent in action; she accepts the magical premise (starlight, impossible botany) without the struggle or scientific interrogation that would generate tension. The internal conflict is resolved too easily when she hands over the tooth after "hesitating only a moment," reducing the character arc to simple compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by labels ("earthbound star watcher") and lacks internal contradiction or distinct agency. Her motivation is delivered via exposition rather than dramatized through struggle, resulting in a character who performs a script rather than making felt choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonists connect too quickly, bypassing the established "wariness" without earned trust. Dialogue relies heavily on diagnostic therapy-speak ("grafting new meaning") rather than organic interaction, making the characters feel like thematic mouthpieces.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a stock archetype defined solely by his profession and a generic block, lacking specific interiority or contradictory impulses. His "conflict" is resolved not through difficult choice or sacrifice but by following instructions from a magical object, resulting in a lack of agency. The emotional arc is asserted through summary ("confidence dwindled," "conflict resolved") rather than dramatized through behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on the stock "whimsical tinkerer" archetype without specific interiority or internal conflict. Elias faces no difficult micro-choices; his success is guaranteed by the premise rather than earned through competence or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kaelen functions more as a ritual implement than a fully realized character. His motivation is explicitly stated in exposition ("to translate heartbeats into maps") rather than dramatized through conflicted choice, and he faces no internal opposition or significant doubt during the process.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist is defined solely by his role and abstract motivation; he exhibits no internal contradiction, flaws, or struggle. He functions as a competent device to advance the plot rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The lack of personal cost or conflicting desires flattens the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt’s requirements rather than a living character with distinct agency. Her motivation is abstract ("inexplicable force") and she faces no internal conflict or hesitation regarding the sacrifice of her humanity, making the emotional stakes feel theoretical rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("determined creation," "hauntingly practical response") rather than dramatized through struggle. The narrator creates a barrier of diagnosis, explaining Elara's feelings and "lessons" instead of letting them emerge from action. The emotional arc feels static; she begins with resolve and ends with resolve, with no visible oscillation or temptation to deviate.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("resolute," "regret") rather than embodied traits or specific behaviors. His internal struggle is summarized through diagnostic language ("regret was a weight") rather than dramatized, and the ghost functions as a static mirror rather than a distinct character exerting active interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on prompt-derived labels ("curious civil engineer mind," "functionally creative nature") rather than demonstrated traits. Elara lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle; her actions are procedural and the emotional stakes are asserted by the narrator rather than felt by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elian is a coherent focalizer, but his internal journey relies on summarized realization ("realized with sudden clarity") rather than dramatized struggle. The recurring epithet "introverted clock scribe" distances the reader, treating his identity as a label rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear, specific motivation ("understand the architecture of lies") that drives the scene. However, the transition from seeker to philosopher relies heavily on summary ("He was an errant legend seeker," "This was a serene upheaval") rather than dramatized struggle. The internal shift feels intellectualized and slightly hasty, lacking the visceral friction of a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined by labels ("philosophical seed collector," "infinite patience") rather than dramatized struggle; he decodes "knots more complex than any textbook" instantly, removing competence friction. His motivation is abstract and his internal state remains static, resulting in a vessel character rather than a distinct agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist acts as a passive observer rather than a character under pressure; his internal state is summarized ("lonesome splendor") rather than dramatized through friction. He faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices on the page, resulting in a static portrait rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("to reawaken beauty") rather than dramatized through struggle. The protagonist's emotional reaction to the destruction of his home and probable death is flattened by the summary "Kael didn't care," robbing the climax of human cost. Internal conflict is replaced by abstract rhetorical questions ("What if it knew?").

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a static vessel for the theme rather than a living character making difficult choices. Her motivation is stated explicitly through abstract summary ("purpose was clear: to prove that scars could sing") rather than dramatized through internal struggle or pressure. There is no contradiction or cost in her emotional arc; she begins and ends in the same state of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("luminous skeptic") that are never dramatized; he accepts magical phenomena without the skepticism his title implies. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he simply follows instructions without making difficult, character-defining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by labels ("sentimentalist," "heart ached") rather than embodied interiority. However, the central choice—adhering to the "no fire" vow to integrate the gear—is well-motivated and creates a distinct, character-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character; his motivation ("to discover the shape of collective grief") is abstract and lacks visceral urgency or specific personal stakes. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; he moves from intention to execution without facing a meaningful obstacle, difficult choice, or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer, but his defining trait ("ethically diligent") is asserted rather than dramatized through struggle; his central action (jamming wood into a precision clock) contradicts the competence established by his role. The emotional arc relies on abstract labels ("shame," "absolution") rather than embodied reactions to the machinery or the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype without internal contradiction or cost. His "blithe" persona is stated but does not create friction with his solemn task, and his flawless execution of the magical procedure leaves him static and unchallengeable.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, lacking internal contradiction or distinct voice. Motivation is stated via exposition ("to seed innovation") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or trade-offs. The emotional arc is flat, moving from "deliberate void" to "quiet confidence" without earning the shift through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist, Elias, acts as a functional vessel for the plot rather than a character with internal life or agency. His "quiet obsession" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult trade-offs; he simply follows instructions without doubt or personal cost. There is no moment where his diligence is truly tested against a meaningful counter-force.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer with a clear objective, but his motivation is stated via exposition ("to crystallize a fleeting emotion") rather than revealed through struggle. The "charlatan" trait is introduced but not dramatized; he performs the ritual with competence rather than the improvisation implied by his "incomplete information."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on repetitive labels ("rationally rebellious," "philosopher") rather than dramatized behavior. The interiority is abstract and summarized, and a catastrophic text artifact (a sentence switching to Chinese) destroys the coherence of the protagonist's voice and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.4)
    Eleanor functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a fully realized character; her "expectant resignation" is a label rather than a demonstrated internal conflict. She faces no genuine opposition in the scene, as the students comply instantly and the administration is absent. The lack of contradictory impulses or difficult choices makes her agency feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara is an idealized archetype who functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living character; she succeeds with "perfect calm" and "disciplined practice," lacking genuine internal friction or doubt. Her trait of being "informally wise" is asserted through narration rather than demonstrated through difficult, high-stakes choices. The potential conflict of her "anger" is resolved instantly via technique, denying her a credible emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's central trait ("involuntarily truthful") is established via exposition rather than pressurized action; the flashback to the merchant lacks immediacy. While the final interaction attempts to use this trait, the "softening into a gentle truth" feels like authorial convenience rather than a costly constraint. Motivation is stated ("goal was simple") rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is defined by the clunky label "creeping normality noticer" rather than embodied behavior or internal contradiction. He functions as a passive observer who executes a procedural ritual without facing a "crucible" or making choices with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael is a compelling protagonist with a distinct perspective that blends the ancient with the immediate. His shift from passive sentinel to active communicator is well-motivated by the arrival of the ampoule. The attribute "incisively kind" is affirmed via exposition ("They were not wrong") rather than purely dramatized, but his handling of the ampoule’s fracture supports the trait well.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on telling rather than showing, using labels like "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" without dramatizing these traits through distinct behavior. Elias functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a fully realized protagonist with contradictory impulses. The internal landscape is described in abstract terms ("urgency pressed in") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is clearly defined as an insomniac painter with a specific motivation ("methodically hopeful"), but her interiority often relies on abstract summaries ("abstract, almost desperate need") rather than embodied struggle. The climax involves a psychic projection ("She felt his surprise") that resolves her internal conflict too easily, lacking a sense of risk or genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's internal landscape is vivid, and her "historically oriented" worldview effectively filters the narrative. However, the climax relies on a didactic speech ("To rescue dying arts...") that resolves the tension with a lecture rather than embodied emotion, flattening the character's complexity at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular and drives the action effectively toward a high-cost resolution. However, the emotional landscape relies on labeled states ("bleak exhilaration," "despair") rather than embodied contradiction or hesitation, making the character feel more like a function of the plot than a fully realized psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is clear, but agency is undermined by the protagonist constantly following the advisor's step-by-step instructions rather than making autonomous choices. Internal conflict is stated ("screamed to look away") rather than dramatized through hesitation or failed attempts before the final success.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist functions as a static archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal conflict or distinct interiority. Motivation is delivered through expository summary ("prophet's calling was singular") rather than dramatized through pressure or difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions more as a plot vehicle than a complex character; her motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on stated emotions ("felt increasingly confined") and physical clichés ("trembling hands") rather than unique psychological texture. Her success stems from the fortuitous discovery of the device rather than agency or trait-specific ingenuity, undermining her role as the driving force.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("prided himself on being emotionally rational") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's behavior—pausing to journal metaphors during a high-stakes infiltration—contradicts the established urgency, undermining credibility. Internal conflict is summarized through exposition ("mission tested even his composure") rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is defined primarily by his label ("firm shore surveyor") and stated role rather than through dramatized choices under pressure. While the "trembling hands" suggest frailty, this constraint is atmospheric; it never forces a tactical trade-off or alters his ability to complete the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias drives the investigation, satisfying basic agency, but his personality is defined by inserted labels ("tranquilly perceptive") rather than dramatized complexity. Internal conflict is absent; he moves from curiosity to certainty without emotional resistance or cost. The reliance on job-title exposition ("logical page indexer") flattens his interiority into a functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivation is deeply embodied; Elias’s internal contradiction—recognizing his art as a "delusion" yet pursuing it as his "only logic"—creates compelling agency. His grief is not static but active, driving the meticulous gem-crafting process on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is distinct, and the shift from survivor to predator provides a compelling internal arc that complicates the protagonist's morality. However, much of the character's depth is delivered through expository reflection ("unfiltered awakening had come to him in fragments") rather than immediate reaction to scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("strange quest for connection," "frequency of belonging") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory desires. The protagonist's "perpetual surprise" is told as a refrain but never demonstrated through a specific reaction or mistake that alters the scene. There is no internal conflict; the transition from military discipline to instinct is smooth and costless.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the "eidetic memory" versus "forgetting his sister" paradox is stated in summary rather than dramatized, weakening its impact on the present moment. The emotional resolution feels rushed; deep trauma is resolved with a few lines of dialogue, making the character arc feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on narrator-supplied labels ("uncommonly thoughtful") rather than dramatized choices. Julian faces no internal contradiction or difficult decision in the scene, reducing him to a static vessel for the backstory and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.7)
    The character is defined primarily through diagnostic labels ("professionally broken," "merrily melancholic") and explicit summaries of motivation ("Her motivation now seemed simple enough") rather than embodied struggle. The internal conflict is resolved via a sudden epiphany triggered by the compass, bypassing the necessary emotional processing and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's internal state relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("empathy had abandoned him," "void where his memories once festered") rather than embodied emotion or specific memory. The motivation is abstract—he seeks "empathy" as a concept rather than a specific human connection—and the resolution hinges on a sudden intellectual realization rather than an earned emotional shift. The use of "diagnostic label-speak" at the peak moment ("empathy... was something to be reclaimed") flattens the character arc into a thematic equation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and poignant, but the internal conflict resolves too smoothly; her "paradoxical steadiness" acts as a buffer that dampens the struggle of the sacrifice, making the emotional cost feel stated rather than endured.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist's motivation—grief and the desire to reclaim lost time—is clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("hollowed her soul," "sharp edges of grief") rather than embodied emotion, and the trait "willingly perplexed" is stated directly as exposition rather than dramatized through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("joy," "regret") rather than embodied experience. The "lighter when happy" trait serves as a visual bookend but fails to constrain choices or force a meaningful trade-off during the crisis. The pacifist nature is stated but does not complicate the central action of stitching.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    Motivation is entirely abstract ("texture of transformation") and lacks grounded, human urgency or specific consequence for failure. Elias is a passive protagonist whose "gift" of coincidence substitutes for agency, removing the need for difficult choices or competence. The emotional arc is told through labels ("profound destitution," "thrill") rather than dramatized through behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("calmly inventive," "sentinel instincts") rather than demonstrated traits. The pivotal decision to switch loyalty occurs with implausible ease and lacks the internal struggle or cost required for a high-stakes defection.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is defined by the prompt's requirements ("vow," "promise") but remains abstract rather than embodied in specific emotional texture. The protagonist functions as a ritual operator; her "precognitive curse" serves as a convenient plot device to deliver instructions rather than a source of genuine internal conflict or character-specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through friction; the "furiously tranquil" trait appears as a label without embodied contradiction. The struggle remains largely internal and abstract, lacking a counter-force to test the poet's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.7)
    Characters function as ciphers for abstract philosophical positions rather than living people with contradictory desires. Elias's motivation is purely intellectual ("dissect a worldview") with no emotional stakes or vulnerability attached to the outcome. The relationship dynamics are static; despite the promise of a "duel," there is no genuine friction or interpersonal cost, only a smooth slide into agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on declared labels rather than dramatized traits; Elias’s "personality molting" is stated as a quirk but lacks psychological consequence or cost in the scene. Maya functions as an exposition device ("I'm Maya... the prison librarian"), and their relationship is summarized ("friendship sparked instantly") rather than built through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("wistful," "steely longing," "strategically creative") rather than dramatized choice or struggle. His internal experience is smoothed over with romantic abstractions, and the ending "peace" feels unearned because he faces no genuine emotional or character-based resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elias is defined by the label "reality checker" and the recurring phrase "luminous doubt," but neither manifests as a conflicting drive or constraint in the scene. His journey is frictionless; he encounters a puzzle and immediately solves it with an unearned intuition ("Unfinished") rather than struggle or sacrifice. The emotional arc is static, ending in a tidy success without the "felt or conceptual cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kenji's internal state is clearly defined, but his dialogue ("Emotions... they have their own magnetic fields") relies on diagnostic label-speak rather than natural expression. His agency is largely outsourced to the "instructions" in the lace and the magical movements of the compass, rather than stemming from a hard internal choice or struggle. The realization at the end feels delivered by the props rather than earned through character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)

    Strong motivation rooted in crafting "safe zones for inquiry," shown through micro-choices like abandoning the vase; interiority concrete and embodied in brow furrowing and fingertip tracing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)

    Motivation clear and intensifies from discovery to playing cello, with embodied reactions like "heart racing" and "fingers itching"; internal shift from skeptic to collaborator earned via decoding.

Minor unearned epiphany slip in "ghost shift" realization slightly abstracts motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya's characterization shines through embodied actions like touching the locket and adaptive playing, with cautious exuberance as a consistent trait driving micro-choices; Leo's breakthrough feels earned via subtle responses culminating in his whisper.

    Aria's sensitively perceptive trait drives concrete micro-choices like activating the spectral device despite risks, earning her final realization; interiority feels particular without stock phrasing.

    Motivation to illuminate assumptions drives consistent actions like chanting and painting, intensifying under pressure. Interiority embodied in "breath catching" and "resolve wavered" during entity thrash, revealing contradiction.

    Shael's traits—calm intuition, shadow-laced empathy—drive consistent micro-choices like selecting visions, earning the final reconstitution; embodied acceptance of personal cost in "responsibility they accepted despite the personal cost" reveals depth without epiphanies. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly limits peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority concrete via perceptual seams and pocket anchor; realization earned through textured immersion, though "fold in patience... crease of Understanding" edges into diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentinel’s motivation clear and consistent in subtle actions like dropping the letter and twisting the tendril, compelling the couple's reconnection with earned endurance of its endless watch.

    Solid motivation rooted in preservation duty, shown through repeated consecrations that intensify with deeper whispers.

    Motivation to transmute pain drives consistent layering choices; embodied perception in stained fingers and soul-hearing; minor slip as contradictory impulses summarize rather than act simultaneously in merging beat.

    Kael's methodical traits and repairer's ingenuity drive the pivot from stopping the hand to redirecting it, embodied in steady hands amid tremors and final collapse.

    Motivation clear and consistent in seeding innovation, shown through calculated writing; however, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with smooth interiority more declarative than embodied (e.g., "groundedly imaginative" label without tense tradeoff).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sebastian's motivation to preserve truth is consistent and drives micro-choices like documenting in code, but interiority leans on diagnostic philosophizing ("rationally rebellious") over embodied contradiction, diluting peak stress in the flood emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eleanor’s motivation to unite voices through music is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies via the rehearsal payoff; interiority concrete in her fingers tracing the rosette and softening resignation to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's involuntary truthfulness constrains early merchant interaction and softens final girl exchange, earning the box-passing choice through consistent motivation to preserve wonder. Contradictory impulses (curse's torture vs. secret-keeping) act in scene via ascent despite routine dimness.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation rooted in "creeping normality noticer's instinct" drives consistent observation to action, with micro-choices like displacements revealing values; interiority concrete via perceptual signatures like "missing heartbeat," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grim optimist trait drives micro-choices like rolling dice mid-ascent and scrawling proofs despite logic, earning the final laugh and healed dice; embodied regret in "texture of a missed opportunity" concretely fuels higher-stakes defiance. Minor label-speak repetition ("grim optimist") slightly abstracts interiority without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses between insomnia-driven desperation and methodical hope act vividly in the ritual scene; final smile and etched proof earn a meaningful internal reconfiguration with the cost of persistent sleeplessness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's historically oriented interiority drives micro-choices like kneading harder and baking the "L," revealing contradictory impulses to preserve amid fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong motivation rooted in inventive traits intensifies to compel the final release; interiority concrete with embodied shiver of exhilaration. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "neatly inventive mind" tells rather than fully dramatizes under peak pressure. Final dissolution feels earned by prior ambition-cost buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling hands and sweat when approaching the death mirror, reveal contradictory impulses toward life and acceptance. Interiority concrete via clasp's pulse and mirror distortions. Final embrace earns change through prior fear buildup, with felt cost of merging death/life halves.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation roots deeply in her cartographer skills and father's legacy, driving micro-choices like decoding patterns and pressing the crack; quietly driven trait shows through obsessive isolation with social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation as archeologist of dreams is rooted in ritual actions like wedging notes into gaps, earning endurance against water's claim; stoically sensitive trait shows via precise movements despite trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's traits drive feverish indexing and hypothesis, with embodied reactions like "heart quickened" and "fingers trembled" revealing stakes; minor label-speak in "tranquilly perceptive nature" slightly undercuts interior specificity without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses embodied in "hands sure but mind trembling" propel persistence despite delusion; final endurance of crafting another crane earns closure with deepening sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation rooted in grief drives obsession with potential mapping, embodied via geode thumbing and bleak exhilaration in chest; contradictory horror/ecstasy impulses act in final hunt prep. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding labels until earned. Minor therapy-speak in "cocktail of bleak exhilaration" slightly abstracts peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kai's interiority shows embodied resonance ("vibration others couldn't detect") and micro-choices under pressure (pushing past programming), earning the final determination surge. Contradictory impulses emerge in instinct vs. parameters. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("coming home to a place they'd never been") feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—continuing false memories despite guilt—act simultaneously in the admission beat, earning the invitational choice with embodied cost via the warming watch hand.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Julian's thoughtful persistence shines through micro-choices like squeezing the drawer pull during tension, earning his final untethering with embodied contradiction between past guilt and present resolve; minor label-speak ("uncommonly thoughtful") slightly abstracts without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (celestial distrust vs. terrestrial markers) drive micro-choices like avoiding then wielding the compass, earning the genuine laugh and course shift with embodied cost of trembling/exhaustion; no closure slips, though minor label-speak ("align heart and action") edges from peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's internal conflict between buried violent past and quest for empathy shows through embodied flashes during submersion, earning the final reclamation; micro-choices like gripping the baseball reveal values. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "kindle empathy" borders therapy-speak but anchors motivation without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Paradoxical steadiness embodied in trembling hands yet unwavering ritual prep earns transformative choice; contradictory reluctance ("I don't want to become something else") acts simultaneously with surrender, compelling reunion with felt cost of altered form.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation rooted in loss intensifies through embodied actions like pressing hand to saucer; internal conflict in "willingly perplexed" vs. grief yields earned endurance. Minor label-speak abstracts peak realization.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation clear and consistent, driving the detour and realization; interiority concrete in whispers to bottle but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final laughter reveals character under pressure effectively. Embodied emotions mostly poetic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's shift from fort protector to revolution ally feels earned through discoveries, with embodied tension in the quill's cool metal drawing heat from her palm. Calmly inventive trait shown in aligning quill with sundial angles. Final panel decision reveals loyalty hierarchy with visible risk, though interior conflict could deepen contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias's mechanical arm integrates into actions and tension effectively, revealing traits under pressure; Lyra applies immediate opposition in dialogue. Final relaxation of the arm marks earned change with relational cost. Interiority leans descriptive over contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in patience with bonsai versus courage deficit with Aiko, embodied in hesitant "I regret" to sea breeze; micro-choices like tracing lace reveal values under remembrance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scientific lens on decay versus cosmic violence gives contradictory texture. Micro-choice (tracing the spiral for Mr. Gable) embodies values hierarchy with cost to her knees and dust supply. Motivation is anchored in trauma-avoidance yet never feels diagnostic; embodiment of “quiet kindness” shows rather than abstracts. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; flaw is implicit in solitary over-control, paid in lonely ending.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s “steadily adaptive” nature becomes a lived, body-level trait: he survives inferno, cleans ash with deliberate slowness, decodes frost runes by lamplight. Each micro-choice—fingering the ledger strip, scooping mineshaft soot into a crucible—betrays a hierarchy of values where art outweighs fear. The final renunciation (no grand unveiling, only embedded soot) costs him worldly acclaim and is earned beat-by-beat. Interiority stays concrete, never therapist-speak; contradiction pulses in his wish to find “purpose in pauses” while obsessively acting.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical and body-attuned (“her breath fogging the panes as if to mimic the frost-kissed world”); motivation stays anchored to the single stake of re-creating sound. Micro-choices—striking the fork, reading the thermal screen—track a believable experimental arc. No contradictory impulses under pressure cost her a path, so the “earned cost” bar is barely missed. Still, the embodied silence-first POV feels particular, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s stubborn refusal to accept the lens as irreparable drives every beat after the inciting package; his interiority is concrete (“muttered at 3:17 AM”) and his micro-choice to dive—despite no guarantee—pays visible physical cost. The endurance at the end (still chasing stillness) is earned stasis, but the emotional layering flattens slightly because we never feel the bodily toll post-dives; competence swamps flaw. Mrs. Hargrove’s spectral cameo supplies closure, yet her on-page pressure is zero, so the relationship crucible requirement is waived. Overall, a credible, character-bound arc with minor embodiment gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet authority and Lena’s guarded curiosity are sketched through economical gesture and choice, but interior contradiction is reported rather than enacted in scene; the final hand-off to Lena reads as summary, muting the cost of leadership passed.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is consistently concrete—his trembling hands, the vial warming in his palm—but the “spiritually curious” trait is announced rather than dramatized until late. The final renunciation (lowering the camera, accepting perpetual pilgrim status) carries visible cost and is seeded by earlier micro-choices, satisfying the 9+ quick test. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, however; the monk memory is reflective exposition, not pressure-tested action. Overall a strong, character-particular arc, but the lack of live internal conflict keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clutching the fragment while longing to destroy it—stay embodied and particular; the tremor in his grip, the burn on his palm, and the final whispered “Let me go” crystallize a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His flawed retrocognitive obsession is never diagnosed, only enacted through the photographs disintegrating in his pocket. The only minor slip is a brief moment of overt thesis (“to discover the texture of time”) that leans toward label-speak, but it is immediately grounded by the searing fragment and collapsing bridges.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s paradoxical role is vividly embodied—he bleeds, times keystrokes with chains, and trades bodily pain for world-level stakes. Interior contradiction is present but sometimes summarized (“his patience had been honed…”) rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The final release and smile carry visible cost earned by the prior causal chain; the moment of near-panic over the mis-played note crystallizes flaw under pressure. Voice remains coherent, but a few stock phrases (“staggering grace,” “heart of ruin”) nudge toward template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradiction—crafting sound while half-deaf, chasing a memory he can’t name—drives every beat. His synesthetic ear (“red cracked like ice”) turns abstract grief into visceral choice, and the final press of ear to forge is an embodied, costly renunciation. The only slack: “battered marvel” is named, not dramatized, muting the interior fracture moment. Still, motive is inseparable from method, and the micro-choice to seal the shard of trust-break inside the forge forecloses his nostalgic loop with visible ash on his palms.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thief’s longing is embodied early (“urge to press his ear against destiny’s door”), but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized until the final mirror beat; micro-choices are few and low-cost. The renunciation is legible and carries luminous imagery, yet the causal path from flower-code obsession to self-recognition is summarized, not pressure-tested. Emotional specificity is strong in the final paragraph, but earlier beats lean on abstract labels (“luminous disbelief”). Still, the character passes the 9- gate test with a visible cost: leaving the portrait untouched reframes his identity and forecloses his old quest.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Finn’s interiority is vivid—his narrating-to-the-void habit externalizes thought without diagnos-tic label-speak. The bookmark as talisman anchors contradictory impulses: preservation vs. release. The renunciation of the vase for the teardrop is earned, but the “thawing heart” epiphany is rushed; one more micro-choice under pressure would have sealed the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stunt double’s fear of enclosure and adaptive trait are shown through bodily tremor, seashell grip, and refusal to bolt—clear micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“his phobia screamed”) without label-speak. Yet the transformative betrayal is only asserted (“he wasn’t the man he’d believed”), never dramatized, so the identity fracture feels announced, not earned; this caps the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen's mild obsession is credibly embodied—his whispered questions, trembling fingers, and accelerating quill strokes externalize an incremental surrender to the dark. Yet the interior contradiction (accepting a gateway instead of resisting loss) is asserted more than dramatized; the pivot from map-as-record to map-as-key arrives as a narrated epiphany rather than a visible cost paid on the page. The absence of another on-page character keeps relationship/status pressure inert, so the "crucible" test defaults to self-confrontation, which only partly satisfies. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature (listening to withheld silence) remains consistent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    734’s drive—trace the origin of consciousness—remains legible throughout; the violin’s pull overrides its janitor directive, a concrete micro-choice that costs its robotic composure. The melting violin’s disappearance is the visible price paid, turning 734 from cleaner to “sentinel of time.” Interiority is necessarily mechanical yet distinct (“its own consciousness fragmenting”), avoiding stock epiphanies. The only bar to 9.0 is the slight explanatory tell in the penultimate paragraph where the story articulates the answer it has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The registrar’s quiet vigilance, micro-choice to step outside, and final offer of tea crystallize a believable shift from observer to host; interiority stays concrete, but the two strangers remain symbolic silhouettes rather than crucibles of status, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s stubborn tenderness toward the vines and his cracked marbles is palpable; every gesture (tracing bark, polishing) embodies both frailty and resolve. His interiority stays particular—no stock labels, just the quiet conviction that gardens “know.” The final moment of recognition lands as earned endurance rather than epiphany, the cost being the lifetime of low-luck labor that precedes it. Slight shortfall: we never feel his body fail in real time; the withering is told more than enacted, so the contradiction stays conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet, work-honed precision and his private crusade to “prove that time moves sideways” give him a consistent, idiosyncratic spine; the story lets us watch his fingers and eyes, not his diary. Internal contradiction is light—only a passing nod to rivalry with past researchers—but embodied emotion is vivid in the pulse of “mechanically warm” metal against his palms. Micro-choices (each lever pull) directly enact his theory, so agency is legible and the final smile feels earned rather than telegraphed. Still, the cost is conceptual, not personal—no foreclosed relationship or tangible sacrifice—so the arc stops just short of painful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cellist’s curiosity is vivid, but his interiority toggles between awe and summary (“strange inspiration had lately taken hold”) without contradictory impulse under pressure; the final nod feels more symbolic than a micro-choice that costs him anything. No embodied contradiction is shown while he deciphers in waist-deep water—he never hesitates, fears drowning, or weighs escape vs. art. The arc lands as observation, not a tested hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“auroral sorrow,” “stone in her gut”); the contradictory pull between scientific training and fault-tolerant visions is dramatized in the charcoal micro-choice. The swallowed-truth motivation anchors every beat, and the final naming of her brother’s erasure carries visible cost. Minor slip: the “diagnostic” phrase “fault-tolerant oracle” is used once without immediate embodied translation, but the next sentence corrects into lived sensation, so the slip stays sub-deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “religiously skeptical” lens colors every perception, and the confession-in-the-car backstory is cleanly cued by the tunnel’s hush. The micro-choice to kneel and turn the wheel dramatizes his need to externalize guilt, and the final emptiness feels earned. Flaw: the swallowed-truth weight is told more than embodied before the valve act; a twinge or breath-constriction earlier would have tightened causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s “observe without judgment” motive is stated early and re-iterated, but it never collides with a test that forces a visible cost or choice; interiority is atmospheric rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values or forecloses a path, so the promised arc of reality-looseness stays ornamental. The ending’s “renewed understanding” is asserted, not dramatized, leaving the character static. For 600–800 words, one credible renunciation or failure-to-act with cost would have elevated this into publish-now territory.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s “softly adaptive” therapist mode is shown through her instrument choices and watchful silence, not jargon; the baby-curl talisman and eclipse timing externalize her motive without therapy-speak. Leo’s first gesture—hand extended in darkness—pays off three months of selective mutism believably because the story lets his body speak first. Interiority stays concrete: harp strings test the air “like a tentative greeting,” not abstract labels. The final mutual curl exchange crystallizes a shared cost—her professional boundary thins, his grief externalized—earning the micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s obsession is vivid, but her interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“questions thrum behind her eyes”). The final choice—sealing the tapestry after decoding the ritual—reads as a foregone continuation rather than a costly renunciation or decisive pivot; the promised price of performing the ritual on herself remains off-stage, blunting earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s lonely puppet-master persona is vivid, but we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene; choices are reported (“he adjusted… began to direct”) rather than enacted under pressure. Interiority drifts into fortune-cookie abstractions (“life, transposed, hummed a new tune”) that flatten embodied cost. The final smile feels unearned because the prior beats show no micro-struggle or visible price—just serene omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The priest’s interiority is rendered through embodied ritual micro-choices—foot on pedal, brush in air—that externalize his contradictory drives to contain and confront the void. His flaw (intellectual hubris that silence can be mastered) compounds across loops, and the Earned Stasis victory leaves him vibrating with unspoken cost: “the weight…settling into his bones.” One slip: the moment of wavering is told in abstract “resolve wavered” rather than shown through perceptual crack.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses—yearning vs. exhaustion—are etched in every stair climbed; the need to “conduct” past sound collides with the bodily price of doing so. Micro-choices (shell placed, crack-hummed, glass flaw sung) reveal a hierarchy of values where artistic rescue outweighs survival. The final slide to the floor is earned: every prior step has foreclosed rest, so collapse is inevitable, costly, visible. Voice remains idiosyncratic; no therapy-speak, only bone-level ache.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s obsessive looping is viscerally embodied—boots “barely touching,” tablet burning his palm—so we feel the cost of eternal iteration. Yet the interior contradiction (conquer vs. prisoner) is told in abstract bursts rather than dramatized micro-choices; the final “I have lost myself” lands as summary, not earned reversal. The beat where he ignores the dissolving double is a sharp glimpse of self-erasure under pressure, but it stands alone; more such concrete fractures would tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s embodied deafness—feeling the phonograph’s scrape through boots, palms, ribs—makes every micro-choice a percussion of need. The broken-needle filing is a visible, tactile ritual that externalizes her interior contradiction: crave sensation yet fear damage. Her final palm-press on the spinning disc is a decisive, costly act that fractures numbness; the price—ruined grooves, bleeding shellac—is felt on the page. No diagnostic self-talk; the body speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “meticulous” label is shown through tactile micro-choices—spectacle adjustment, tube-groove tracing—yet interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“nurture his integrity”) rather than embodied contradiction. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; the final decision to trust the rogue is credible but the cost is stated, not dramatized. Trait of “credibly curious” drives the lateral leaps, but the curiosity never collides with a counter-impulse that would sharpen flaw or risk. Still, the storm-recorder vocation permeates perception filters and earns its keep in the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—seeking the very smells that undo him—drives every micro-choice; the trembling decision to trap the ultraviolet shadow instead of the bloom’s perfume crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The embodied grief (“tears…with clarity”) is earned, not declared, and the cost of knowing is sealed in the luminous vial. No stock therapy-speak; even the word “grieve” is dramatized through olfactory shock. Flaw: the father’s wool-coat memory arrives as a compressed info-dump rather than a prior dramatized seed, slightly blunting the final renunciation’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Langdon’s “ethically playful” stance is shown through the final knot-tying that refuses either offered device, a micro-choice that fuses escape and captivity; the rope as tactile conscience keeps contradiction alive in scene. Interiority stays concrete—dust on fibers, starlight on skin—without label-speak. The cost is legible: he forfeits both perfect timeline and ignorant bliss, accepting permanent tension. What keeps this from 8+ is that the contradiction is more asserted than dramatized in earlier beats; we are told of past sacrifices rather than seeing one squeeze him here.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—“the hush unbearable, not absence of sound but of purpose”—but her contradictory impulses stay mostly in reflective summary rather than in-scene collision. The violin/bowl micro-choices are present yet feel predetermined by poetic design, not flaw-driven risk; the “tear that is not sad” is a performed epiphany rather than an embodied cost. A credible renunciation is implied, but the path feels lyrically pre-ordained, so the final stance lacks a palpable fork not taken. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and consistent, meriting high-band proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dealer’s shift from extractor to conduit is credibly grounded in repeated, embodied contact with the petal’s charge; the final pocketing is a micro-choice that costs them their detachment. Interiority stays concrete (“familiar weight,” “rare, genuine smile”) and avoids diagnostic speak. Professionally thorough trait is shown, not told, through ritual sleeve-adjust and logged transaction. The one flaw: the chemist’s interiority is inferred with unwarranted certainty (“realized the chemist’s longing wasn’t for tears”), a knowledge leak that keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marla’s “shrewd broker” core is shown through her habit of letting others take credit and her refusal to chase applause, but the interior contradiction—tempering exuberance vs. the exhilaration she feels—remains summary. The single active micro-choice (bending to help the composer) is consistent with her established trait yet carries no visible cost; the emotional stakes plateau rather than tighten. Frederick is sketched only in externals (grease stains, widened eyes), so the relationship-crucible pressure is one-sided. Still, the private smile and the ignored shipping alert dramatize her hierarchy of values more effectively than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael's ache to belong is embodied every time he braids reeds; the half-tag moment lets him confront failure with raw palms and flickering chest-light. His micro-choice to finish the symbol, not find it, crystallizes his hierarchy: community over personal proof. Interiority stays concrete—“his heart a vessel of luminescence” remains a physical datum, never therapy-speak. The earned renunciation of being “the art” carries visible cost: the sculptures warm under his touch, the ache softens—an embodied, irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive to catalogue vanishing beauty and uncage the source of the echoes is lucid and embodied; the infinity pendant is both tool and private emblem, the charcoal smudge on the feather registers as lived craft. Interiority stays specific—"his breath misting the air," "a smile on his face"—and the contradiction between self-preservation and world-breaking is held in scene, not summarised. One cost-touch is missing: we never feel the physical price of "borrowing" a week of future life; the collapse is mentioned rather than suffered. Still, the final renunciation is earned and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and character-specific; the glass eyes act as embodied contradiction between grief and methodical hope. The final renunciation—“perhaps the ambiguity wasn’t a problem to be solved but a space to inhabit”—is earned by the iterative nightly trials and crystallizes a visible cost (tears sizzling on stone). Minor over-articulation of “mathematics of emotion” flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is immediately grounded in tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior life is richly textured—his fingers “tracing familiar paths” and the metallic smell triggering a Proustian plunge into childhood archive work—yet the story withholds any contradiction that would force a wrenching micro-choice under pressure. His kindness and methodical nature are shown through tactile ritual, but the arc is observation-to-gift rather than sacrifice, so the cost feels diffuse; the closure smile is earned yet not paid for by a lost path. Still, the lonely custodian who yearns to be “seen without being seen” is individuated, flawed, and consistent, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s monomaniacal drive to “decode” the leaf is palpable in every micro-choice; the final surrender is foreshadowed by his escalating intrusions and their failure. Interiority is specific—”chlorophyll than with people,” “taut wire vibrating”—never generic. The only cap: no second character on stage, so status/relationship bullets N/A; solitary POV handled with consistent perceptual signature. Cost is embodied when rain pierces his skin, mirroring the leaf’s scars—earned stasis with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s exhausted vigilance is viscerally embodied (“canvas-stained fingers traced…”) and her micro-choice to pocket the brooch primes the later exchange; the stranger’s mirrored fatigue and identical name arrive too late for relationship-as-crucible pressure, but Elara’s insomnia-driven perception stays consistent and idiosyncratic. Interiority avoids label-speak; the final smile is a credible, earned renunciation of sleep as escape. Motive is legible but never crystallizes into a visible high-stakes trade-off, keeping it just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “blankness” of sight is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (touching walls, reaching for the pearl). Yet her surrender to the unseen forces reads as externally authored rather than wrestled with; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is stated (“bright darkness”) rather than embodied in a visible forfeiture. The pilgrim’s arrival is too smoothly synchronous to act as a crucible that pressures her values. Competent, but the transformation leans on lyric assertion over earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “obsession” with fragments is shown via the deliberate empty shelves—but the decisive moment of handing the valve to the community is filtered through summary, not a visible micro-choice. The poet Mara remains a symbolic listener rather than a pressure source, so the relationship crucible is mild. The renunciation of completeness in favor of “acknowledged absence” is credible and thematically earned, yet the cost is stated rather than embodied in a final gesture. Voice stays consistent and vocationally colored; still, the climax would sharpen if Elara’s own body betrayed the strain of letting the gap stand.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mapper’s contradictory impulses—precision versus surrender to the uncanny—are dramatized in the moment he presses the punch to the gate; the trembling hand, frost-breath, and boots sinking into fog embody fear and resolve at once. Yet the interiority leans on stock phrase “mix of dread and exhilaration” and awards himself a therapeutic summary smile at the end, blunting ambiguity. The punch’s weight and warmth give two tactile beats, but no secondary character presses him, so status crucible is absent. The arc lands as renunciation rather than conquest, satisfying Earned Stasis, but the cost feels conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “sympathetic skeptic” contradiction is shown in the moment she lifts the tile despite doubt; her interiority stays anchored in bodily warmth and the village’s grief. The renunciation of skepticism is earned: the cascade of others’ memories visibly costs her—“her heart heavy yet light.” Minor slip: “courageously kind” is stated twice rather than revealed through a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The immortal’s monomaniacal hunger to “see what happens after goodbye” is the engine of every beat; his dimensional awareness is shown, not told, through the way he reads magnetic lines as exit veins. Interiority stays crystalline and specific—his “dead heart” pulsing in sync with the fragment is a perfect embodied contradiction. The final renunciation—letting go into unmaking—pays off every prior micro-choice; the cost is the erasure of the observer himself, legible in the scar left in space.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya's interior contradiction—honesty forged from a liar's toolkit—shows in her tactile care with the ink she refuses to touch. The brush-stroke on the keypad crystallizes her hierarchy: redemptive use of inherited skill over self-protection. Elena is functional, not full-fleshed, but her grip on Maya's arm supplies enough secondary pressure. The “karmic account” ledger is stated more than dramatized, yet the final refusal to keep the pot turns inheritance into cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s solitude-borne obsession is rendered with tactile, profession-specific rituals—charting a lamp’s hum, burnishing gold leaf—so his motives feel lived-in. The contradictory impulse (preserve ghosts yet invent new ones) stays active in each micro-choice, and the final beat of quiet satisfaction earns its poise because we have watched the precise labor that underwrites it. No secondary character appears, so status dynamics are N/A; head-count cap is irrelevant. The only bar to 8+ is that the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is evocative—his “mosaic of forgotten moments” and the way overheard voices graft onto the poison label—but the ghosted man remains a device more than a contradictory psyche. No micro-choice after the find alters his tactics; he merely pockets the label and resumes walking, so the path from discovery to identity is told, not tested. The ending renunciation (he accepts being stories) is seeded, yet no prior beat risks an alternative, so the cost feels conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—career debunker now chasing his own myth—are cleanly dramatized through the cello reenactment and compass re-orientation. The interiority is concrete (“gloomy cheerfulness lifting”), emotions embodied in heat from the shell and bow tension. Micro-choice to keep playing after the shell turns inward crystallizes his new stance; cost is the compass’s long reset, an earned delay. Closure renunciation (no hurry) is causally tied to the inward pivot; the mentor-memory beat supplies credible prior fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s orderly-intuitive trait is shown through pattern-seeing and graffiti logistics, grounding her motive to preserve the carnivalesque. Interiority stays concrete—her hope “wavers” at the barges—but the dual-allegiance conflict is summarized more than dramatized; the final stance shift feels earned yet understated. Micro-choices (painting, placing the chip) are visible, but no contradictory impulse is staged inside a scene; the emotional cost is implied rather than embodied in a single charged beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s lineage-linked motive (inherited grain, last-of-its-kind photograph) is specific and stakes his identity; the “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized in his chemical-timing invention. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and exhaustion is shown through bodily micro-choices (“pressed against the lunar surface”). The flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in scene—risk, fear of failure, or temptation to abandon—so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation of future access feels earned because radiation closure is already on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s blindness is never allowed to become a gimmick; every tactile micro-choice (the fountain test, the wire re-seating) is a fresh, character-specific beat that proves competence while exposing real limits. His calm is earned through repeated embodied risk—he can fail the patch, lose the drone, and the story lets that cost hover. Interiority stays in his fingers, not in abstract labels; the single voiced line “There” carries the weight of a decisive, irreversible micro-bet. The closure beat—drone aloft, mist thinning—crystallizes an earned stasis: he restores flight he will never see, and the reader feels the price of that permanent asymmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s subtle confidence and dry wit are continuously surfaced through his curt asides (“Of course... it would have to be the one place no one looks”) and the methodical way he handles the phrasebook and laptop. The interiority stays concrete—tracing droplets, smelling pages—rather than abstract, and his final resolve feels earned by prior scholarly obsession and mentor loyalty. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly smooth, but the visible cost is the vanishing patterns: he must act before knowledge evaporates. Flaw: no second character on page, so relationship/status bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tuner’s motivation—restore balance via sound—stays abstract; no interior contradiction or embodied cost complicates his march. He is more mythic device than psyche, so the “wild hush” payoff feels given, not earned. Still, his unwavering gait and the town’s concrete reactions supply a minimal arc of change.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marina’s mentor-promise and the vial-warmth give a clean emotional anchor; contradictory impulses appear only in the summary “override instinct,” never dramatized in a moment of hesitation or micro-choice. Interiority drifts into grand abstract nouns (“reshape understanding…”) instead of body-level fear or calculation. The final integration is declared, not visibly paid for on the page—no felt cost in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—lifelong truth-telling yet inheriting a reputation for lies—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to unscrew the lattice rather than shout again crystallizes his arc. Interiority is concrete (“tasting the metallic tang of air”), but the emotional cost at the exit beat is slightly under-dramatized: we see no flicker of guilt or triumph that would foreclose the parental legacy. Still, his flawed persistence charges the escape, earning a credible renunciation of voice in favor of vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses—guilt, longing, lethal tenderness—are etched into every spectral gesture; the bead’s warmth and the “lovingly venomous” refrain dramatize interior split without therapeutic gloss. The renunciation at the end (she fades, forfeiting reunion) is earned by the chain of past betrayal→debt→repayment traced in the bead’s pulses. Visible cost: his hand passes through hers, her form dissolves, bead clatters—concrete forfeiture legible on page. One sentence drifts toward label-speak (“a promise broken under a blood-red moon”) but the embodied chill/ozone/veil kisses overwhelm it.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—stoic artisan vs. sleep-drawn mystic—surface in embodied micro-choices (pressing the warm plate to stone, stitching air). Yet the interior rationale for why she alone can ‘sew’ reanimation remains thin; the mystic gift is asserted, not earned flaw. Closure renunciation reverence rather than reclaim the sea is legible, but cost feels aesthetic, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her satchel strap, the “warmly curious” flutter—and her lineage-loss motive gains mass through the sundial fragment. The moment she kneels to seat the disk, her contradictory impulses (restoration vs. exile cynic) collide on-page, paying visible cost with the silver-light snap. Status/relationship crucible is absent, so full 9.0+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elliot’s interiority is lyrically specific—his ritualistic chalk-coding, the tactile memory of analog screens—but motivation stays abstract: “discover meaning in the margins” is stated, never dramatized as a concrete dilemma. No contradictory impulse forces a visible cost; the moment of mailing is summarized, not chosen under pressure. The ebony clipboard is handled, yet its quantum bulk never complicates or limits him. Character change is implied, not enacted; the closing brush-off of chalk is calm routine, not renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “wise fool” mask is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“the universe…a tapestry of lies”) that reduces contradictory impulse to aphorism; no micro-choice after the mid-point visibly risks his cover, so the renunciation at the end feels assumed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The medium’s interiority is concrete—she crouches, trembles, steadies herself through tactile cues—yet her contradictory fear/resolve never crystallizes into a visible wrong-choice moment; the apology she channels is not her own, so the cost is displaced rather than personally paid, keeping the arc one beat short of full earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is rich—translator’s badge, coral graft, hand wound all braid his guilt and vocation—but the child’s motives stay opaque; her “shrewdly innocent” label never actively complicates his decryption. The micro-choice to point at the spiral is believable, yet her reciprocal knowledge (“same ocean”) feels bestowed rather than earned. Still, his final smile manifests credible renunciation with cost. Meets 9+ quick test for earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s yearning for “lost joy” is vivid early, but her interiority drifts into lyric summary (“pensive mirth” repeated) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the single micro-choice—initiating the light ritual—launches the vision but carries no visible risk or trade-off, so the beat feels more observational than crucible. The absence of live opposition or cost keeps the arc just below the 7.3 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. wonder—stays alive in her finger-stroke hesitations and the nickel’s heat; the final renunciation of the “solid” world is earned through tactile micro-choices. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Still, the nickel’s grin never complicates her flaw; it only confirms her, capping the score short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s glint-and-spectacles trick risks charming-rogue cliché, yet his “plant them” micro-choice under raid pressure embodies the taxed-thought paranoia and earns the guarded-spark stance. Interiority stays concrete: soil under nails, weight of seed in palm. Contradictory impulse—thriving on chaos yet calculating each horticultural syllable—shows in scene, not summary. Cost is felt: the single etched wildflower is both triumph and future exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush but drifts into performed sorrow; the “shyly unstoppable” tag recycles three times without fresh contradiction. The centuries-long lifespan is asserted, never tested by physical limits or memory decay, so the final smile feels unearned. Micro-choices are few—mostly tracing and kneeling—so agency stays poetic, not crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The caretaker’s solemn, self-sacrificing drive is palpable, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“foxglove regret”) rather than embodied contradiction. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the memory-forfeiture micro-choice is present yet under-dramatized. The endurance stance is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than sharply individuated. Still, the singular obsession holds together under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” core is dramatized in every physical beat: her trembling hand on the tome, the audacity to write vows in star-ink, the final step toward him. Interior contradiction pulses—“reverence and urgency,” “gamble” vs. “meticulous linguist”—and the body shows it: breathless, laughing, fingers finding his like a “last missing note.” The arc moves from solitary decoder to co-composer; the cost is the shattered well and the exposed heart. Only micro-slip: “carefully reckless” is named twice; trimming one would let the trait speak purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The machinist’s contradictory impulses—duty to the town vs. guilt over its cost—stay active in every beat; the chain’s worn 39th link embodies his mother’s plea and crystallizes his final, costly recalibration. Interiority is concrete (“his hands trembled, not from fear, but from anticipation”) and never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0: the mother remains off-page, so the emotional cost is filtered through relic and analyzer rather than live relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s obsessive need to preserve a lost song through pigeon-flight and dust-mote mapping is vivid, embodied, and internally contradictory; the Mars chip as silent vessel of his sister’s lullaby drives every micro-choice. The final release of the storm-cloud pigeon crystallizes a believable renunciation—he trusts his self-invented method, not people—with cost legible in the attic’s resumed solitude. Interiority rarely lapses into label-speak; instead, decaying paper scent and trembling bone tweezers externalize grief. Flaw: the “re-invented personal history” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single flash, so the past blurs slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elea’s “gift” and her drive to decode thresholds remain abstract; no embodied contradiction or on-page micro-choice tests her resolve. The father’s absence is felt, yet her decisions (tracing wood, staying on the terrace) aren’t forced into costly trade-offs, so the arc feels observational. Interiority leans on poetic labels (“featherly determined heart”) rather than specific, pressured thought. Endurance is declared, not dramatized with visible cost, so the renunciation lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara’s motive—"to learn the rhythm of belonging"—is stated repeatedly yet never dramatized as a concrete dilemma; her micro-choices inside the archive don’t risk anything tangible. The burnt-feather discovery triggers curiosity, but no contradictory impulse (stay/leave, share/hide) is acted out in scene, so interior tension is only summarized. Because the final stance costs her nothing visible—no lost relationship, no forfeited future—the epiphany feels un-earned. Voice drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder") that flattens embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aelia’s interiority is concrete—she sighs, murmurs, presses hands to glass—but the emotional contradiction promised by “cheerful gloom” is stated, not dramatized. The crater-glass work shows micro-choices, yet the missing-path obsession is told repeatedly rather than tested in scene. The final “bittersweet sensation” is generic payoff for three cycles of alleged obsession; no new flaw or cost is exposed. Still, her perceptual filter (rainbow light, seed-stars) stays consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s calm choreography of accidents is credibly obsessive; the bishop-touch beats anchor his need for control without explanatory labels. The woman’s shattered-glass eyes and key conjure effective counter-pressure, forcing a micro-choice to trust. Interior contradiction is present—he craves randomness yet scripts every beat—but the final kiss and ticking clock crystallize his tolerance of real chance. Cost is felt: the clock starts, the game ends, the next blank canvas looms.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—yearning to transcend yet bound by garden exile—anchors the arc; the final “cosmic verse” burned into skin is earned by prior micro-choices and lunar-dust study. Emotion is embodied in vein-light and obsidian reflections, not labels. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship/status crucible unused; also, competence (tide mastery) slightly over-balances visible struggle. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait whose renunciation lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—e.g. “second spine” glasspanes, “overgrown thoughts” gulls—yet the glazier’s only micro-choice is skipping a stone. No contradiction under pressure, no relationship crucible, no visible cost when the sun erases the mist; the “earned stasis” is asserted, not dramatized. Daughter-memory and storm-hunch remain lyrical garnish rather than stakes-forcing forces. Character is vivid, but agency is observational, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s burn-scar constellation and the bell-box fetish object give him a tactile, embodied contradiction; the interior monologue stays concrete until the penultimate paragraph’s therapy-speak “reframe his relationship to it,” which softens the final micro-choice. The three-year lag between trauma and tonight’s walk is credible, but the on-page shift from shame to service is more asserted than dramatized—no single risky action seals the cost. Still, the bell’s return to pocket reads as Earned Stasis with residual weight, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost fully.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “logical dreamer” profile is vividly embodied: she traces ripples like equations, names her work “trial balloons,” and uses a gauge as emotional seismograph. Interior contradiction is alive—hope vs. empirical doubt—yet the only micro-choice with visible cost is the final step outward; prior pattern-arranging reads as rehearsal, not irreversible stake-burning. Still, her perceptual signature is so specific that motivation stays legible and compelling throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s perceptual sensitivity is dramatized through bodily shivers, trembling gloved hands, and the moment he “let the images flood his mind,” giving us embodied cost. The motivation—“to discover what walls dream about”—is peculiar yet consistent, driving every beat; the diary/negative chain escalates his obsession rather than merely decorating it. Interior contradiction is present: curiosity vs. dread as he senses the woman’s fate may become his. The final renunciation (“he felt chosen”) lands as Earned Stasis because we have felt the sensuous price of listening too closely; still, the beat is compressed into one rhetorical flourish, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The painter’s interior contradiction—needing isolation yet trading her own arrhythmic heart for steady rhythm—grounds every brush-stroke; the borrowed heartbeat literally dictates tempo, forcing her into micro-choices (humming pace, brush lift) that externalize the conflict. Calm-as-trait is shown, not labeled: her fingers “move with perceptively calm purpose” while the borrowed drum races, a tension visible in the final accelerating beat before bells. The only softness: we glimpse no genuine flaw-generated mistake on the canvas; her calm never visibly cracks, so cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Still, renunciation is earned: she walks away leaving every possibility dissolved, paying with permanent anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—grief soaked into joints, clipboard weight as joint ache—and the contradictory impulse to keep speaking names while fearing their futility is dramatized in-scene. The micro-choice to begin with “Anara of the Seventh Sector” is concretely anchored and visibly costs him voice tremor, fulfilling the 9+ test. Reflection stays under 20 % and each memory cue forces an on-page vocal act, so BRR is clean. The only mild safety-hedge is the closing self-forgiveness cadence “no longer afraid,” but the prior bodily toll earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—profit from drought vs. reverence for lost birds—are declared rather than dramatized; the egg-release is the only micro-choice that visibly costs him, so the arc feels asserted. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“fractured grace,” “secretly sentimental”) without embodied contradiction in real time. Still, the final renunciation lands because the salt-flat silence and evaporating footprints externalize a believable self-punishment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lush but drifts toward poetic abstraction; the courtesan’s contradictory impulses are declared (“refused to be a hollow melody”) rather than enacted in a beat we can see. The single on-page choice—snapping the red thread—earns some cost, yet the prior threads are untangled in summary, blurring the hierarchy of values we need to feel the stakes escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s serene mask and slow release of the puppets from strings give a credible arc, but the interior contradiction between commercial calligrapher and underground agitator is asserted rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final “uncommonly serene” reset feels inherited, not paid for by visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s transiently-rooted stance and reverent micro-choices (weaving, incorporating the fallen monarch) embody an esoteric realist; the moth-wing placement at the apex visibly costs delicacy and frames his refusal to preserve—an earned stasis. Interiority is concrete, but the “overlooked histories” motive is stated more than dramatized, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caster’s guilt, vocation, and need to “listen” rather than “create” braid into a single arc; the re-knotting of ancestral hair literalizes his interior contradiction. His “technically gentle” hands embody the tension between violence and care in every tug. The moment he hears his own name whispered back crystallizes a cost that has been earned beat-by-beat. Interiority stays concrete—no therapeutic self-labeling—and the final smile carries visible forfeiture of his old sculptor identity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is consistently textured—his “precisely playful” choreography of future-proofing micro-choices is dramatized, not labeled. The single contradiction—he is both prisoner and keeper—remains abstract, never embodied in a beat where he tries and fails to leave; that caps emotional cost. Closure accepts his nature, but the renunciation is asserted more than felt. Still, the causal chain from playful nudge to AI rebirth is character-specific and earns the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’ interiority is concrete and particular—his amusement at “empirically ironic” devotion, the feel of cool tile, the economy of his tools. Contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. occult hunger) operate simultaneously in-scene, not in summary. The renunciation—leaving the tile—pays a felt cost: he walks into possible exile already “counted among” the stars. Only minor flaw: the decade-long backstory is compressed to one clause, slightly blunting the depth of his obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s pacifist-schemer contradiction is stated but never tested; he never faces a moment where non-violent tactic risks failure or moral cost. The identical forgiveness ritual six times flattens interiority into therapeutic refrain (“cellular memory” becomes label-speak). No micro-choice escalates his own stakes; the box reappears magically, so he never confronts what its brokenness demands of him. The ending claims self-healing yet offers no visible cost or foreclosed path for Elias himself.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s desire to “capture” the dream is declared, not embodied; no contradictory impulse complicates it. The only micro-choice—breathing in rhythm—remains abstract; we never feel his body under threat or taste the cost of failure. The ending’s “home” for the dream grants him what he sought without foreclosing a path or exacting visible price, so the arc lands as observation, not earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mender’s interiority is concrete—her quartz eye “whirrs,” dirt stains her fingers, and the ribbon scrape anchors filial ache. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. fear the seed is futile) act in-scene, but the daughter stays off-page so no status crucible can test the shift. The final renunciation—plant the bridge, accept waiting—earns its cost through prior ritual beats, though the emotional price is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Margaret’s interiority is vivid—her bewilderment is repeatedly embodied (head-ache, palm-warmth, brightened disquiet). Yet the nonlinear premise keeps her from making consequential choices; instead she “accepts” and “wonders,” so no credible renunciation or tightening is earned. The note she leaves is the only micro-choice, and it merely repeats the prompt phrase rather than revealing a personal cost. Flaw stays minor because the piece is lyric-accumulative, but character agency remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s desire to locate Kael is steady and credible; her embodied scholarship (cross-referencing, reciting omissions) shows interiority without therapy-speak. The “true name” reconstruction is the single moment that flips his trance, but the text summarizes rather than dramatizes her discovery of that name, muting the cost of her arc. No secondary characters share the page, so relationship crucible is N/A. The flaw of over-intellectualizing is present but never complicates her path; still, her micro-choices keep agency visible and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    The chimera twin’s interiority is lyrically sustained—mismatched limbs steadying against rust, the split self felt in every motion—but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the final merge is declared, not wrestled. Micro-choices (pressing the card, swiping the threads) are ritual, not tactical, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than character-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s “warmly methodical” temperament is shown through tactile braiding work and the indexing metaphor; interiority stays concrete. The indexing-as-bones image makes his merger act feel inevitable and personal. Yet the epiphany that absence = potential arrives as declared wisdom (“he saw how…”) rather than dramatized contradiction, slightly softening the cost. Still, the fused wax seal on the wall is a visible, earned scar.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lorne’s vocation and solitude are vivid, but interiority is mostly declarative (“his purpose was to map…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the bloom succeeds on first attempt so no flaw or cost is tested, keeping the arc flat. Emotional stakes are asserted, not dramatized through error or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—bare feet reading vibrations, retrocognitive flashes of ancient hands—but his contradictory impulses (restore order vs. surrender to cosmic accident) are stated more than dramatized. The one micro-choice—turning the focusing ring—feels singular; we don’t see earlier failed attempts or visible trade-offs that would foreclose alternatives. Earned stasis is present: he accepts the cracked prism as amplifier, but the cost is lyrical assertion rather than embodied consequence. Still, his perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers “preemptively nostalgic,” his breath hitching under the weight of revelation. The contradiction between his need to archive and the fear of losing clarity is held in scene, not stated. The final smile is a credibly costly stance: he accepts that his own memories will one day be whispers, and that knowledge lands with quiet force. Only the “summer-quill” label is ornamental; it never acquires tactical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlo’s interiority is textured—“serious playfulness,” the lavender/kerosene scent cross-wiring—but the moment of change is delivered as paraphrased insight rather than embodied contradiction; the final realization is told, not dramatized under pressure, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s observant passivity is consistent, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“I’ve learned to foresee change…”) that tells us the insight rather than dramatizing it. The micro-choice—setting the cicada down—carries symbolic weight yet alters no on-page option; cost is only asserted, not felt. Mara remains a silent mirror, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and status pressure is zero. Warmly observant trait is asserted repeatedly but never costs Elian anything or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—hunger for silence yet terror of exposure—are dramatized in her meticulous fasting of ears and the white-knuckled grip on the doll. Every beat is filtered through her claustrophobic sensorium; even the decision to step onto the trellis is a micro-choice that forecloses retreat. The porcelain doll’s warming and the permanent internalization of “gilded hush” show a visible, felt cost scaled to the length. Interiority never abstracts into label-speak; instead, “stretched and contracted” embodies the paradox of expansion inside containment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s gentle, almost devotional stewardship of silence is embodied in every micro-gesture (kneeling, palm-cool vial, slow exhale), but her interiority never cracks into contradiction or visible cost; the motive stays singular, serene, untested by a counter-impulse. No relationship on stage means no status crucible; the terraces act as chorus, not pressure. The result is a lyrical persona more than a dynamically flawed agent, so the “change” is atmospheric, not character-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—preserve secrecy vs. reclaim earthly wisdom—are dramatized in frantic paint-peeling and the final renunciation of the throne; the cost (exile risk, ancestral burden) is felt. Interiority stays concrete: “fingers trembling,” “heart raced.” One beat of diagnostic self-label (“wisely adventurous”) is brief and embedded in grandmother’s voice, so allowed. The refusal to claim power is earned by the generational memory cascade, giving credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s isolation and self-surgery metaphor hold steady, but interiority drifts into explanatory shorthand (“learned that intimacy was sometimes a form of consumption”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The phantom-pain notion is evocative yet never embodied on the page; we see no micro-choice that dramatizes her reliving a severed connection. The climactic decision to re-bridge is declared, not earned by a visible earlier beat that shows the cost of loneliness outweighing contamination risk.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s survivor guilt is conveyed through concrete bodily memory and the diamond-making beat; still, “therapy-speak” labels (“the weight of false promises,” “close the wound”) soften the peak moment and keep contradictory impulses off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’ interiority is evocative—“dynasty ender, not by sword but by quiet erasure”—yet the emotional pivot relies on a single abstract realization rather than a visible, costly micro-choice. The final stance is legible, but the cost is felt conceptually, not bodily or socially, so the renunciation lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation—“to capture the shape of possibility”—is declared early and re-iterated, but interiority stays abstract (“shivering bliss,” “weight of allegiance”) rather than dramatized through body or choice. The gear-removal beat is a clear external pivot, yet the emotional cost is told, not embodied; no contradictory impulse complicates the knight’s calm. Micro-choices exist (tracing fruit, kneeling, unsnapping), but they read ritualistic rather than character-specific. Earned change is present but skated over in lyrical summary; hence the arc feels templated, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior life is palpable—“tactfully hopeful” beats show in micro-choices—but no on-page contradiction forces a visible renunciation; Elias’s stance softens yet never stakes a path he must relinquish, so closure lacks a felt cost paid by character flaw, capping 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s vigilante archivist persona is sketched vividly—her tactile key-tracing, puddle-map reading, and ninety-second broadcast gamble all embody “carefully resourceful.” Interiority, however, leans on diagnostic labels (“cognitive erosion,” “Tyranny of Indifference”) rather than embodied contradiction, muting the last-scene cost. No other character applies live pressure, so the single-POV crucible never tightens. The earned stasis lands, but the emotional price feels more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s lonely vigil is credibly inhabited: the trembling fingers that first received the coded sheet now steady on cold brass, his body registers the town’s unconsciousness (“etched with the worry of someone carrying a silent burden”).
    The absence of any second character keeps relationship pressure off-page; we are asked to believe the stakes solely through interior worry, yet the prose never dramatizes a moment where Elias almost fails or questions the cost—his endurance reads as given rather than re-earned each dawn.
    Still, the final image of reflected faces in dew spheres crystallizes a palpable, quiet cost: he ages while the town sleeps unaware, a renunciation that forecloses a normal life.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his finger-dances, whispered credo, and secret monuments all reveal a man trading ritual for revelation. The final shift from “sorter” to “keeper” is earned because every preparatory micro-choice (sorting, collecting, prodding) has been dramatized. Yet the emotional contradiction under pressure is told more than embodied; we’re informed “his heart seized” rather than shown a visceral stutter in his star-tweezer grip. Still, the visible cost—his room’s transformation from static shrine to living archive—makes the renunciation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—fixing time yet unable to fix himself—threads every beat; his trembling decision to trust the spinning compass embodies the cost of renouncing control. Micro-choices (kneeling, wading, releasing gears) externalize the “uncertainly certain” trait without explanatory labels. Final laughter and the compass’s new north crystallize earned stasis: he pays by surrendering the project that once defined him. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and alchemist-specific, but the transformation arc leans on abstract self-talk (“he finally understood”) rather than a visible, costly choice. The emotional stakes are felt, yet the decisive beat is narrated summary, not dramatized micro-choice, so the change feels slightly granted rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The collector’s quiet, ritualized micro-choices (raising the tooth, kneeling to plant it) embody his vocation; contradictory impulses—hunger for contact vs. the ache of each release—stay active in scene. Emotions are corporeal (“luminous ache,” chest tightening) rather than labeled. No lasting flaw or mistake complicates the cycle; the cost is felt but not dramatized as a personal limitation, keeping the arc more numinous than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s proprioceptive memory and mask-ghost pressure are dramatized as living instruments: the “phantom weight” steers both his collapse and the calculus insight. Interior contradiction is constant—he clings to pain’s geometry while hunting its antidote—embodied in tremoring hands and neck-angle replication. The final step forward crystallizes a credible, costly stance: to keep using the very circuitry of trauma as his laboratory. No diagnostic self-labeling; every beat is muscle and vertigo.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motive—recover matriarchal translator lineage—stays sharp; micro-choice (taking the first canvas) shows risk. Interiority (“she had always been here”) is concrete yet avoids diagnostic speak. The Earned Stasis—accepting endless work—carries cost, though emotional contradiction could be pushed further in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The technician’s quiet, almost sacramental absorption of the room’s grief makes his every micro-choice (hand hovering, dust-reading, ladder climb) a credible extension of his vocation. The mainspring-in-pocket moment crystallizes a renunciation: he carries away the site’s last secret, accepting the mantle of perpetual witness. Interiority remains tactile—“his burden weightless in its familiarity”—never devolving into diagnostic self-talk. Contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mourner) coexist in-scene, powering the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—order vs. the lure of rupture—is shown in embodied micro-choices (leaving the press, pocketing the bottle). The final leap is credibly foreshadowed by his growing abandonment of ritual. Cost is felt: inkless hands = identity erased. Just shy of 9 because the whispers’ seduction is more asserted than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—ex-rebel hunger for truth vs curatorial need for control—are dramatized in every mirror-covering gesture; the final renunciation of academic validation is earned and costly. Interiority stays embodied (“hands that still remembered the shape of a protest sign”) and avoids diagnostic jargon. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: he forfeits institutional credit to protect the shard’s living memory. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off the page, capping excellence at 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “mending what isn’t torn” gift is vivid and embodied, but his interiority slips into abstract thesis-statements (“the covenant of rust,” “quiet devotion of those who listen…”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The final smile feels tidy after town-scale salvation; no visible personal cost or foreclosed path is shown, so the renunciation/readiness lands as sentiment more than Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and character-specific; his sensory obsession with petrichor and the “auditory clearing” after the mill closes are embodied, not abstract. The pivot from collector to seeker is motivated by lifelong ache and sealed by the lagoon revelation, a renunciation that costs him his prior identity—visible on-page. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ test fails by a hair, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s “perpetually learning” trait is asserted but never embodied in a contradictory choice; she simply decodes the slide and follows it. The interiority is lyrically voiced yet generic (“her heart thrumming”) and never complicates her stance. Closure is serene acceptance rather than a costly renunciation, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lena’s quiet drive is credibly embodied in her night-foraging for postcards and the cross-legged ritual on the studio floor; the contradiction between public acclaim and private obsession stays alive. Interiority avoids label-speak—her “secret garden” is shown via paint-stained fingers, not therapy prose. The final softening into contentment is earned because the murals physically externalize her transformed stance, foreclosing older solitude with visible cost: she installs the cards in a public case and stays to guide twilight visitors. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s solemn-archivist identity is shown through tactile micro-choices (ciphering, kneeling to trace driftwood) that escalate into spiritual risk; the diary’s heat on his ribs literalizes cost. Interiority stays concrete (“bones to water,” “searing reverie”) and contradicts his scholarly composure under retrocognitive duress. The final renunciation—accepting lifelong translator status—pays off earlier stubborn cataloguing. Voice remains singular; no safety-hedging moral balance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s wish-for-rebuilding motive stays steady, but interiority lapses into generic “weight in his chest” and “heart raced.” The decisive renunciation of easy restoration is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told he “rejected false comfort” instead of watching a moment where he could have chosen it and turned away. No contradictory impulse is shown on-page; the tension is purely declarative. Earned change is present but under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is rich—his fingers “remembering languages that had ceased breathing” shows embodied craft—but his final surrender reads as abstract acquiescence rather than a contradictory, costly choice. The prophecy’s emotional overwrite is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose alternatives. We feel his vocation’s weight, yet the closing “vessel for their rebirth” lacks a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is vivid—"furiously tranquil" embodies the paradox—but emotions tilt toward performed lyricism more than embodied contradiction. The ancestral flashback supplies motive yet occurs in summary, so the final forehead-touch feels slightly unearned. Still, the micro-choice to press the acorn cap into the floor crystallizes values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s “credibly curious” trait is shown through tactile sensor-tweaking and the anemometer ritual, but interiority flirts with label-speak (“his credibly curious nature had led him…”) and the moment of final cost is more calm satisfaction than contradictory tug. The micro-choice to tug the bell three times crystallizes his hierarchy of values, yet the emotional friction stays modest—no visible regret or forfeiture stains the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s spiritual-custodian persona is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“flourishing stillness,” “transformative power”) that flattens contradiction. No embodied emotion under the meteor-empathy beats; she “feels resonance” rather than trembling, tearing, or breath-catching. The final renunciation is signaled, yet the cost feels intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elisha’s interiority is quietly specific—his fingers “weathered,” his reverence “bordering on prayer.” The trait “tranquilly perceptive” is shown through micro-choices: lifting the box, reading color shifts, accepting three new ghosts. Yet the climax is a summary gesture (“he began speaking not with words but with intention”) rather than a dramatized beat; the cost of reknitting the covenant is felt externally, not internally. Earned stasis is credible, but the absence of a visible internal fracture keeps the arc just shy of high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “quiet, persistent need to understand the texture of time” is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulse or body-level cost; interiority stays safely paraphrased. His single micro-choice—descending the silo—follows the urn’s GPS-like instructions rather than a visible internal clash, so the ending’s consolation feels imported, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s dying caretaker premise is vivid, but interiority stays general (“peculiar kind of peace,” “no fear in his acceptance”) rather than dramatized contradiction. His only visible micro-choice—wrapping copper—recycles the same beat; we watch repeated action rather than escalating risk or trade-off. The diary is handled, yet never shapes a decisive turn; motivation remains static. Earned stasis is credible, but the absence of visible flaw or compounding mistake keeps the arc thinner than length allows.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid, skeptical, and embodied—his fingers “catching the last of the day’s bronze quiet” shows perception filtered through a scientist’s eye. The fly-amber micro-choices (clutch, trace, place) externalize an inner turn from detached observer to reluctant catalyst, the cost legible in the vanished amber and his “more alone than ever” exit. The academically rebellious trait is dramatized, not labeled: he bristles at “variables unchecked,” refuses the herd, yet kneels and participates. Only minor slip: the final “pull of home” is slightly abstract; still, the arc is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s contradictory impulses—ferrying oblivion yet planting memory—are alive in scene: he scatters seeds while hearing bird-mandated “Now,” a micro-choice that costs him the last of his cargo. His grief is embodied in the hollow that “mirrored the hollow in…his ancient heart,” not abstracted. The renunciation at dawn (silent departure after luminous roots appear) is earned by the ritual beats and carries visible cost: he forfeits remaining pods and any future return. Only the “ancient heart” cliché and slight over-reliance on epithet (“gloom-hill coachman”) keep it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—finding his sister—remains legible and personal, but the interiority drifts toward abstract summary (“translate distance into closeness”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure tests his resolve until the final cylinder spin, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. The wax leaf reprise supplies a crisp externalized beat, yet the emotional arc is told more than dramatized. Fits the Track-A single-POV default cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—guilt over the shutdown vs. his need to keep navigating—stays embodied in tiny, credible acts: fingers tracing the compass, breath held at the shimmer. The “blessed pariah” label is shown, not told, through the station’s frozen panic hologram and his solitary vigil. His micro-choice to draw the ghost-sky rather than the memory-sky is a visible pivot that costs him the comfort of nostalgia, earning the explorer stance. No other character is on stage, so relationship bullets are N/A; headroom to 8+ would need a sharper external test of his flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—honor-bound loyalty vs. world-saving betrayal—are alive in the scene: the tremor in his fingers on the ivory king, the moment he passes back the sundial lid. The Architect’s curiosity-not-rage shift is credible, but the interior rationale (“couldn’t bear to watch the world lose its wildness”) is stated once too often, edging toward label-speak. The final grin costs him his mentor’s protection; the renunciation is earned. Still, the apprentice–mentor status leap is compressed; a single extra beat of visible regret would have nailed the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory selves—crisis-actor performer and near-drowned survivor—are vividly anchored in body memory; the tremor before touching the board, the knee that buckles at missing pawns, makes internal conflict physical. Motive progression is legible: from performing trauma to collecting “small gestures,” each micro-choice (kneeling, tracing squares, spelling words in dust) pays off the mission to unbind performance from lived pain. Cost is felt: the final “remember” is an earned renunciation of further performance, knees already gray with dust. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; slight over-reliance on abstract noun phrases (“luminous void”) keeps it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—"chest tightening painfully," fingers brushing feather/stone—yet the arc is almost pure reflection; no second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The buried-talent reawakening is tracked through sensorial micro-choices (touching feather, watching mirror), but the decisive “crossing” is still interior and forecast rather than enacted, muting the cost visibility needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction is present—guilt vs. the need for precision—but the embodied emotion drifts into label-speak (“guilt-ridden heart,” “fierce repose”) that flattens peak beats. Micro-choice is visible when he presses the crimson thread, yet the stakes of that act feel abstract because the ruined lives remain off-stage. The final pawn move reads as earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we’re told guilt lifts rather than feeling the chafe of its absence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elaran’s “defiant artist” core is vividly dramatized through the sketch-journal and the escalating poetry raids; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs communal loyalty) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final decision to fracture the truth into bearable verses is prepared by every earlier poetic refracting, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—heartbeat as metronome, verses as lock-picks—without diagnostic self-talk. Only the elders remain off-page, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are absent; the single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“breaths held underwater” as lived habit—yet the turn from uncertainty to certainty leans on abstract self-assertion rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path; cost is felt but not tethered to a specific forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The painter’s interior contradiction—clutching memory yet needing release—drives every beat; the embodied tremor of age and the deliberate un-painting of the shell make his renunciation legible and costly. Micro-choices (kneeling, lowering the shell) reveal value hierarchy without diagnostic talk. Final stance crystallizes: aloofness thins as he accepts transience, foreclosing the vault habit. Slight reserve: we never feel the mirror-crack moment on the page—only its summary—so the flaw that birthed the promise remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientific detachment vs. the “screaming tenderness” he feels—is embodied in every micro-choice: palm on peeling paint, thumb on cork, the decision to open his hand rather than throw. The vial cork acts as externalized conscience, stripping ego from intent and forcing him to confront the cost of pure transmission. His renunciation of force (letting the wind beckon) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: truth over contact, silence over reply. The price—permanent unknowing—lands on the page in the final calm, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is sensory and specific; the coat-patches and censer foot act as embodied memory. One contradiction—he “doesn’t pick up” yet the voice “would tell him only what he already knew”—flattens micro-choice tension at the climax beat, nudging the score down from 8+. Still, the renunciation of the phone method lands as earned stasis with visible cost: he walks away carrying the bronze weight, grief literalized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness and rational truffle-forager identity are crisply dramatized in the first beat—her suspicion floods the stranger’s mind, forcing an immediate defensive reaction. The glass-eye activation is a clean micro-choice that externalizes her need for privacy and changes the relational state on the spot. The closing beat of “imperfect psychological safety” is an earned renunciation: she gifts the relic, accepting perpetual risk. The stranger remains a sounding board rather than a second crucible, but at this length the single-relationship pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    Hemlock’s “borrowed memories” gift is vivid, but his interiority drifts into exposition; the Edelweiss memory-surge is told more than embodied. The final nightly gesture shows earned endurance with cost, yet his contradictory impulses (keep vs. share isolation) stay implicit—never enacted in scene. Character voice distinct, but micro-choices under pressure are scarce; the memory inheritance is backstory-heavy and only tilts present stance once.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. hunger for self-authorship—stays embodied (finger on crease, knees creak). The micro-choice to kneel and follow ants crystallizes the shift from curator to agent; cost is the ache in his joints and the solitary years he can’t reclaim. Final smile is fragile but earned, showing a believable, non-heroic change. Secondary pressure absent (no on-page relationships), but single-POV arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich—her crown “too heavy for her brow,” the dream-bleed of starlight—but the decisive turn (she is the grotto’s exiled guardian) arrives as retrospective download rather than dramatized contradiction; cost is felt, yet the flaw is ironed out in a single beat of memory rather than pressed under continuing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s need to quantify vs. romantic’s rapture—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (clutching columella, guiding light-threads). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forecloses the past as immutable, trading it for a pocket-star whose warmth she must now bear. Kael functions only as whisper-trigger; no relational crucible, so relationship bullets skipped. One nagging slip: “scientifically romantic mind racing” is diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, blunting immediacy −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for innocence while documenting his own expiration—are vivid in the birch-bark writing and graveyard confrontation. The jealousy-method is declared more than dramatized; no micro-choice shows him spurning a present option to protect a past self. Interiority is textured (“jaded wonder,” “feral nostalgia”) but stays reflective; the final “genuine smile” is the first embodied beat of release. Closure earns credible endurance, yet the cost is more announced (“most beautiful rebellion”) than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her trembling hands, the phantom ache of absent scent—and the screw’s discovery forces a credible shift from numb endurance to active remembrance. The moment she traces the inscription, her stance toward her own grief reconfigures with visible cost: she weeps, then steadies to repair the clock. Motivation stays character-bound; no knowledge leaks. The only minor slack is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she had fixed herself”) that slightly over-articulates the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aeris’s interiority is vivid—knuckles whitening, crystal lattice blooming—and every bodily reaction is tethered to the ritual’s stakes. The micro-choice to clutch the quill as “night-sky” fuses superstition with scholarship, letting flaws drive the metamorphosis. The cost is legible: flesh becomes stone, tea goes cold, and the path back to unmarked skin is foreclosed. Missing secondary characters limits relationship-as-crucible pressure, but single-POV intensity compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eloise’s guilt and need to apologize are signaled early and embodied in her careful handling of the bottle; the moment she murmurs “Time to try something new” shows a micro-choice under pressure. Alistair’s remorse is conveyed only through disembodied voice, so his interiority is second-hand, slightly thinning the crucible. The mutual forgiveness lands with felt cost for both—her decades of running, his century of regret—earning the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    A lone figure with no name or distinguishing trait beyond his cosmic job-title; we are told he “witnesses” but never see him decide, doubt, or even flinch. Internal contradiction is declared (“wanderingly exact”) yet never dramatized in scene—he drifts through cathedral prose rather than acting under pressure. The promised sacrifice of “certainty” is asserted, not embodied; no micro-choice shows him paying that cost. The result is a cipher who could be swapped for any other robed seeker without altering a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—precision-lover who distrusts his own instruments—animates every beat. The backwards-counting micro-choice dramatizes this flaw and directly triggers the stutter-discovery, charging the climax. Cost is felt when he accepts lifelong isolation/"peculiar" label as price for seeing the illusion. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; headcount default satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “quiet wildfire” and spatial gift are asserted more than dramatized; his only visible choice is to follow the woman and accept the partnership, a turn that feels gentle rather than costly. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“he realized he’d been wrong”) instead of embodied contradiction. The woman remains a cipher—laser pointer as proxy—so the relationship crucible is thin. Still, the single-POV voice stays consistent and the final micro-choice to “let them in” is character-linked.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory drives—gambler’s hunger for chaos versus daughterly love—are dramatized in the subway notebook, but her interiority sometimes tips into packaged aphorism (“life was about possibility, the infinite odds of the human heart”). The father’s shift from statistical scorn to wonder is credible because the notebook’s concrete fragments act as external leverage; still, his emotional turn is compressed into a single beat, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Archie’s estrangement-is-service paradox is vivid, but his interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs him something on the page; the loop repeats without a moment where he contemplates stepping out, so the “earned stasis” feels observed rather than suffered. The inherited phrase “Sometimes the best connections start as mistakes” hints at prior self-doubt, yet the present-tense Archie is too serenely effective to feel the toll of seven years in the rust-ozone dark.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete, anchored to the locket and stained fingers; the contradiction between duty and grief is active in-scene. His final act—surrendering the locket to the bloom—pays the accumulated cost of decades and is earned by every backward-dripping memory. No secondary character on page, so status crucible waived; solo arc suffices. Voice remains particular to the archivist’s profession and loss without slipping into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orion’s interiority is sharply particular—"jocular mask he wore as deftly as any field uniform"—and his loneliness is embodied (vacuum in chest) rather than labeled. The contradictory impulse to barter moon rock for connection while insisting on vanishing is dramatized in-scene. Final renunciation—staying still to listen—carries visible cost: the logistician who moves supplies must forfeit motion. Micro-choice hierarchy (moon fragment vs. auditory world) reweights values with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—selfish seeker vs. sacred pilgrim—remains active in every beat; the embodied tremor-language and ring-warmth keep emotion off the diagnostic couch. The final renunciation (mapless, note-less) is earned by the prior dowsed melody and costs him his former identity. Micro-choices (bare feet, splay-fingered dowsing) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Flaw is not hedged: blindness is not super-power, stillpoint does not cure, only re-weights.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction—"confidently uncertain"—is lived in every beat; the pen’s glow and the decision to rewrite then un-write the rewrite manifest a simultaneous pull toward control and surrender. Embodied emotion in the trembling nib and the interpreter’s tilted walk under anomaly gravity keep therapy-speak at bay. The final renunciation—loving the weeds—pays the cost of the earlier loneliness in a single visible image, earning the Earned Stasis. Only micro-gap: we never learn why the interpreter first planted “wrong” seeds; the flaw is hairline and doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian’s grief-tinged reverence for the camera and Lyra’s quietly magnetic resolve feel specific and embodied; their interlocking sign-language duet shows contradictory impulses (hope vs. erasure) in real time. Yet the text keeps declaring their bond rather than testing it—no micro-choice visibly risks or costs either character—so the arc lands more as mood than crucible. The final vow “your work becomes your ghost” is earned by imagery, but the emotional plateau stays flat because nothing is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—guilt over fire vs. need to finish the trail—stays alive in every brush-stroke. Micro-choices (paint the leader’s eyes, burn the treaty) visibly cost her and foreclose return to anonymity. Motive linkage to mother is told, not dramatized, muting causal bite. Still, the “tender volcano” refrain embodies her ambivalence without therapeutic jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—guinea-pig submission vs. dream-guardian defiance—stays alive in every beat; the drumming micro-choices embody it without diagnostic jargon. The moment he gentles the rhythm into a heartbeat, we see a visible cost: surrender of pure rebellion to keep the lagoon alive. Only lapse: no second character on-page, so status crucible and voice-distinction bullets remain un-triggered; headcount is forgiven because pressure is internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s quiet competitiveness and map-obsession are concrete from the first paragraph; the coin-in-hand micro-choice to hand Jenna his prize embodies a credible renunciation that costs him the very token he fought for, earning the closure moment. Interiority stays tactile (“fingers closed around the zodiac coin,” “steps deliberate yet fluid”) rather than diagnostic. Only the “labyrinth feels alive” note drifts toward abstraction, but the body-in-motion keeps it embodied. The relationship under pressure sharpens when Jenna’s scoff melts into awe—an earned status shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Anna’s grief is concrete (unsent letters), but the guardian’s interiority is almost entirely abstract (“stillwater tension,” “silent empathy”) without embodied contradiction. His single micro-choice—tilting the mirror to finalize the shutter pattern—earns the revelation for Anna, yet costs him nothing we can feel. The emotional arc lands for Anna, but the guardian remains a serene mechanism, not a crucified agent.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arthur’s interiority is evocative—his synesthetic sensitivity to “unspoken words” is embodied in every beat—but the promised internal contradiction (gift as burden vs. fuel) is asserted more than dramatized; no moment forces him to choose between isolating self-protection and revolutionary exposure. The micro-choice to smile at the baker’s unspoken worry is the single visible fork, and its cost is only implied. Earned stasis is credible, yet the absence of a tested limit keeps this short of 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s guarded-cage interiority is vivid and embodied (“violence she’d never known gave way to a tender ferocity”), but the causality between scrimshaw-glow and heart-unlock is asserted, not dramatized; the climactic choice rests on lyrical declaration rather than a visible micro-choice with cost. Still, her contradictory impulses (conformity vs. defiance) stay alive in scene and the final stance is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—compliance versus subversion—are dramatized through the micro-choices of whittling, hiding, and narrating tea. The final insertion of the hummingbird among the flowers earns its place because every prior sliver of wood has been carved under the same risk. Still, the lack of any second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible pressure, and the interiority occasionally drifts toward performed stillness rather than embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interior desire to dissolve rather than describe is embodied in the moment he presses flesh to quartz and lets language go; the “raw, unfiltered desire” is shown through physical dissolution, not labelled. His poet-identity is more than costume: the refusal to paraphrase becomes the tactical choice that unlocks passage, marrying vocation to stakes. Cost is legible—he loses the safety of form, self-boundary, and former voice—yet the contradictory tug between wonder and vertigo is kept in scene. Only minor flattening: “rare, genuine expression” is diagnostic self-label that slips into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s colorblind painter identity, plant-code language, and “innocently cunning” trait are vividly embodied in every beat; the bargain micro-choice (white lily) crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final renunciation of gray life is earned by the prior causal chain. Minor slip: Lyra’s interiority is only gestured at, but she functions as pressure, not focalizer, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but coherent; the bell-ringer’s contradictory impulse—seeking connection through deliberate silence—remains embodied in every micro-choice (tilting the lens, stepping into the halo). The “powerfully gentle” trait is shown, not labeled, and visibly governs the final renunciation of the lamp. No second character, so relationship crucible is waived; the solo arc still earns an earned stasis with felt cost—the lens is relinquished, the pilgrimage redefined. Emotional progression layers without tidy resolution; the laugh is credible irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s grief feels concrete—silver-stained fingers, the pendant with his daughter’s birth date—but his transformation from solitary mourner to time-spanning mentor is told more than dramatized. The interior contradiction (crafting mementos of death that now seed hope) is strong, yet we never see him hesitate or resist the new mission, so the renunciation cost is only asserted. The network of former students launching their own observatories is a powerful proxy for earned change, but the beat where he decides to distribute the coordinate pendants is elided; we jump from “he now folded tiny origami” to summary of results. Still, the specificity of his craft and the bodily memory of his child keep him individual, not allegorical.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is steady and specific—her “steadily curious” lens never slips—but the story withholds any internal contradiction that would force a visible cost. She explains rather than struggles; the grandmother’s absence is backstory, not a live pressure that distorts her choices. The only micro-choice—deciding to “continue the work”—restates the opening stance without foreclosing an alternative. No flaw compounds or charges the ending, so the arc feels diagrammed, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    The historian’s lifelong hunger for forbidden knowledge is stated early and re-iterated, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“joy surged…anguish coiled”) rather than dramatized in a single, embodied beat. The climactic “pattern-breaking” dance is a decisive action tied to her motive, yet the prior failures of other historians are told, not shown, so the personal cost feels second-hand. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; micro-choices under pressure are present but abstract. Still, the arc from detachment (veil on) to total immersion (veil off, atoms within) provides a visible stance shift with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “luminous regret” felt in her chest is specific. Motivation is legible—preserve hope by re-binding shadows—and intensifies across beats. Micro-choice at the river stone (activating resonance chamber) is concrete, though the final “constant vigilance” stance is declared not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maria’s interior contradiction—needing to excise fraud while still caring for the animals—is alive in every tactile beat (fingers on the tail, page-turns). Her “gentle” trait shows in how she handles both journal and sister, not in labels. The renunciation of the old foundation is earned: her ledger scrutiny and the sister’s squeeze make the cost felt. Flaw: the climactic “I’m reconstructing my ability to trust” is slightly diagnostic; a hairline slip from embodied to abstract keeps it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya’s “closure-seeker who opens wounds” is dramatized through her surgical erasure of scars and the reversed mission to Samuel; the coffee-ring epiphany gives embodied cost. Yet interiority drifts into psych-label shorthand (“tunnel vision,” “displaced miracle”) and the plant-whisper gift is asserted, not tested under pressure. The final renunciation lands, but the contradiction between healer-as-wound-opener and telepathic listener stays declarative rather than acted-out.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal gazer’s interiority is textured—his “spatially imaginative” gift is shown, not labeled, when he folds time like cloth. Yet his want (“where is unused love stored?”) stays abstract; we never learn why this answer matters today, not yesterday, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. The final peace is earned by the revelation, not by any micro-choice that risks tangible loss, so the arc is more insight than change.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—yearning to write vs. fear of her own gift—are dramatized in embodied, scene-locked beats (trembling fingers, gasping at visions). The micro-choice to tilt the astrolabe again after each meteor steadily raises stakes; the final collapse and quiet hum show credible endurance with cost (exhaustion, stardust coat). No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Earned renunciation lands: she forgoes immediate word-output for the slower "rest" that re-opens possibility, a believable arc for a moonstruck dreamer.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dreamless freight guard’s motivation—to nurture a seedling of possibility—is clear and anchored in his blank-slate mind, but his interiority stays largely declarative (“his heart carried the steady beat”) rather than embodied under pressure; the single micro-choice (planting the seedling) is quietly earned yet lacks visible cost or contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into label-speak ("probable miracle," "threshold of understanding") that abstracts instead of embodying crisis. The gear’s neural remap is the only concrete choice; prior “micro-choices” are observational, not tactical. Earned cost is present yet filtered through philosophical summary rather than bodily jeopardy, blunting the stake’s edge. Still, the voice stays singular and the arc legible—just shy of publish-tier compression.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The traveler remains a silhouette; no interior contradiction or embodied emotion is dramatized. Marek and Elara function as oracles, not crucibles—their advice is lyrical but never tests or alters the traveler’s stance. The only micro-choice—reaching into the pool—arrives without prior tension or cost, so the change feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bellhop’s interior contradiction—docile obedience versus covert curiosity—peaks when he pockets the bolt; that micro-choice is concrete, embodied, and irreversibly alters his stance. The final resolve to “wait with it” crystallizes an Earned Stasis whose cost is legible in the bolt’s cold weight and the piano’s re-locked silence. Minor slip: “heart full of cold, quiet fire” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting the earlier subtle embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s regally unpretentious stance and millennia-long patience are shown through silent ritual and the final flick of ink, not told—an earned, visible cost. The contradiction between titanic lineage and self-imposed imprisonment is kept alive in every micro-action (dissolving a fragment, waiting). Interiority stays concrete: “the inky blooming like a miniature nebula” is perception, not label. Only two characters appear and status shift is legible in the single line of dialogue; no relational crucible is required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “know the rhythm,” the atlas page’s salt-softened edges felt in pocket—but the shift from grief to acceptance is compressed into a single lyrical pulse rather than dramatized micro-choices. Flaw: the crucial “smile” arrives without embodied contradiction or visible cost, tilting the arc toward epiphany rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Barefoot stargazer’s interiority is textured—cold concrete under toes, brass chill of opera glasses—but the “meaning” she seeks stays abstract; no concrete want is tested. The stone-circle hum gives her a luminous moment of palmed vibration yet no visible trade-off or renunciation happens; the closure is internal re-lighting, not a choice that costs her anything. Still, her perceptual signature (bare feet as celestial body, dust as galaxies) keeps characterization specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maeva’s insurgent fire is credible for 73, her telepathy grounded in tactile fern-contact, and her final glyph-tracing act carries visible cost as traditions rupture around her. Interiority stays concrete (“symbols danced before her tired eyes”) and her endurance reframes elder strength without cliché. The absence of on-page opposition or relationship crucible keeps her just shy of 8-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s quiet talent is shown through tactile gardening beats that externalize grief; the framed photo choice at the end crystallizes her earned shift from hiding to integrating memory. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead using soil-touch and salt-spray as somatic triggers. The only minor slack: the lighthouse-keeper philosophy is recounted rather than dramatized, slightly blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is rich and painter-specific; the arc from despair to remaking is credible. Yet the shift from passive grief to active weaving relies on a single abstract whisper (“by untangling threads”) rather than a dramatized trigger, softening the motivation at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s obsession with time-dilation is concrete and embodied in the drone-ink ritual; the final micro-choice—accepting transience—earns its poise. Yet interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“he had learned to quiet its noise with silence”) that flattens contradiction. No second character appears, so status crucible is waived; the tracker’s competence is balanced by the ink’s refusal to stay, a credible limit.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“bravely conflicted mind,” “heart raced,” “fingers trembled”—but stays at the level of performed emotion; we never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, only alternating labels. Her motive is clear (provoke the buried conversation) yet the cost is asserted rather than embodied: the only tangible price is off-stage “sirens” and “hunt,” not a choice she renounces on the page. Micro-choices are missing between slipping the letter into the terminal and fleeing; the moment of irreversible agency is summarized, not dramatized, so the change feels declared, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s pacifism is textured through ritual (velvet-wrapping the knife), but the piece never forces her to test it under live pressure; the father stays off-stage, so the filial crucible is only asserted. Interiority is lush yet loops: “tranquil blaze” recurs four times without deepening. The final image glows, but the cost is ambient, not personal—she loses nothing we’ve seen her crave.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—grief/joy floods through the fisher’s body in the penultimate beat, contradicting his outward calm. Micro-choices (spike arcs, silence glyphs) externalize longing with visible cost. No head-count issues; single-POV focus holds. The only nick: the “cool-headed” trait is asserted more than dramatized until late; still, the final beat earns the endurance with a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“solitary playfulness,” brass sphere “slow, deliberate regret”—her contradictory impulses (grief vs investigative zeal) stay embodied and scene-locked. Every micro-choice (hovering nib, under-drawer search) is traceable to her inherited “curse of the curious” and the fresh lethal threat. The final renunciation of passive grief for active exposure lands with visible cost: accepting that printing the truth may repeat the murder loop. Missing 9-band only because the moment of explicit fear (flaw acknowledgement under new threat) is compressed into one clause rather than lived contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core grief is embodied through tactile micro-choices—tracing Cassiopeia, trembling hands after amber translation—and the final stoic prepping of the needle shows earned endurance that forecloses denial; the emotional hierarchy never slips into therapy-speak. Interior contradiction is light (only one voiced regret line), and the external/internal split could be sharper under peak pressure, yet the visible cost on the midnight ritual keeps motivation coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s artistic obsession and “socially perceptive” tag are declared repeatedly but never dramatized in conflict with anyone; the only micro-choice—pressing her palm into the mandala—comes without visible cost or contradiction, so the promised interior complexity stays abstract. The chalk-stained fingers and lilac anxiety are evocative yet decorative; they don’t force her to relinquish anything or risk failure, so the arc feels like graceful ritual rather than pressured character change.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s “gentle radical” contradiction is embodied in every gesture—soft fingers pressing a jagged tessera that draws blood, the refusal to flee the fire-memories she never lived. The retrocognitive curse is dramatized, not labelled: she flinches at screams we don’t hear, keeps working. The renaming obsession is the only motivational spine; no second character or status crucible appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Cost is present—the cut palm, the looping trauma—but the final “bloom” feels more hopeful than the price paid, a hairline softening of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Arthur’s encore-longing is vivid and embodied (“translucent form illuminating dust motes”), but his shift from self-absorbed ghost to civic guardian is declared rather than dramatized; no interior friction accompanies the change, so the renunciation feels convenient, not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “affectionate skeptic” trait is shown through her decision to translate, not suppress, the psychic noise into art, but interiority drifts into diagnostic labels (“somatic markers”) that dampen embodied immediacy. The final stance-crystallization feels earned because the muscovite-in-hand moment visibly costs her exhaustion, yet the contradiction between loving wonder and demanding evidence stays more declared than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rational map-maker vs. credulous conduit—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, touching, laughing) that visibly cost her composure. The fossil’s warmth spreading “through her” fuses motive and sensation, making her final stance crystallization (“she was ready to tell its story”) feel earned. One hairline slip: “her motivation burned brighter than ever” drifts toward label-speak, but it is immediately anchored to tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically consistent—her quiet awe, tactile attention to buttons, and final resolve feel character-specific. Yet the prophecy’s personal stakes stay abstract; we never see what concrete village peril she fears, so her emotional risk reads as symbolic rather than embodied. The button-sorting ritual is lovely but too frictionless—no mis-sorting, doubt, or memory that stings—and the closing smile arrives without a visible cost to her person. Still, her perceptual signature (resin scent, dust, heartbeat-echo sync) keeps the portrait above mid-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—survivor’s caution versus paternal remorse—are alive in every beat; the micro-choice to stamp the snow-cipher while swallowing the risk of trap shows the “prudently daring” trait in action. Interiority stays concrete (“phantom of warmth in the biting air”) and avoids diagnostic speak. The final renunciation—guaranteeing Althea a future by disappearing—pays off the established guilt and is causally earned. Cost is visible: he forfeits identity, contact, even the right to be remembered, fulfilling the closure under Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman’s vigil is anchored in a single, embodied motive—honor the palimpsest promise—yet his interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“spindrift serenity”) that performs rather than reveals contradiction. The yarn needle as tactile memory works, but the brother’s transfiguration into a cloaked stranger lands as external sleight-of-hand rather than earned character logic; no interior friction accompanies the recognition beat. Still, his stoic endurance and the smile at the end register as a credible, if quiet, renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s quiet, observant nature is consistently embodied through tactile micro-choices (thumb on glass, smoke-watch, hand on fracture). Interiority stays concrete; the final “offering” is a credible renunciation that costs him the anomaly’s thrumming intimacy. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the arc is more steady revelation than pressured change—still earned, but short of the 9-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gardener’s protected vulnerability and wistful pragmatism are credibly embodied in his midnight mirror-work; his micro-adjustments with the bitting gauge tooth reveal a quiet hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. Interior contradiction is present—he both accepts winter’s bleakness and fights it—yet the arc stays modest: endurance rather than transformation. Because no other character shares the scene, the relationship crucible is absent, but the solitary stance feels earned. The final image of neighbors unknowingly continuing his craft shows cost (his invisibility) and is legible under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—atomically reflective skin as both shield and mirror of isolation—but her “brittle awakenings” remain abstract labels until the final line. The shift from curse to opportunity is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page enacts the turn. The sundial-touch is the closest we get to embodied decision, yet it triggers no visible cost or irreversible change. Motivation is coherent, but the climactic reframe feels pre-announced rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his obsession with the “thread” is embodied in the twig spiral he fondles like a talisman. The contradiction between his voyeuristic knowledge of others’ hearts and his own isolation is implied but never crystallized into a beat where we feel the cost of that gap. The moment of integration—“he was not just a keeper of secrets, but a part of their tapestry”—lands as assertion rather than embodied choice; we see no micro-decision that risks anything. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the flaw is minor enough that closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s isolation and scientific conviction are sketched efficiently, but her interiority stays largely expository (“cautiously hopeful” is told, not embodied). The stakes register intellectually yet never bite into her body or routine—no sleepless twitch, no hunger pang, no risk to a valued relationship—so the micro-choices feel lightweight. Closure is a functional Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is external (community manipulation ends) rather than personal, keeping the arc more premise than person.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid (“her heart hammering against the familiar prison of her own ribs”), but the claustrophobia is announced more than embodied in micro-choices; the single decisive action—pressing the compass—lands, yet the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping emotional legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s face-blindness and ritualized method are consistently dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tweezers, charcoal strokes). The interior contradiction—he can’t see faces yet “sees” ghosts in evidence—drives every beat and culminates in the Earned Stasis of leaving the portrait on the museum steps. Cost is legible: he forfeits recognition and comfort, carrying “the weight of Lena’s story” into the fog. Minor slip: the abstract label “dormant empathy” is stated rather than embodied, blunting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his palm registers the nail’s cold, the twilight is “perpetual” to him, dread is “spongey,” not abstract. Contradictory impulses (honor vs. preserve) are declared rather than dramatized in-scene; the micro-choice to twist the nail arrives late and is under-embodied. The final renunciation carries conceptual cost, but the emotional price is implied rather than felt in body or gesture. Voice stays coherent and particular; occupation (“map librarian”) surfaces only as label, never as perceptual filter.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “dynamically observant” trait is embodied in concrete beats—she decodes scaffold-wrap glyphs and lets the glass flake dictate new melodies—so her vocation and curiosity feel lived-in rather than label-only. A minor dent: the interior contradiction between rational skepticism and supernatural acceptance is asserted more than dramatized until the final stance, so the emotional cost arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jasper’s calm is stated more than dramatized; the single moment of micro-choice—walking out of the board meeting—carries visible cost but arrives late. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“some paths circle back because the human heart beats in cycles”) rather than embodied contradiction. Still, the inherited-money motif anchors his agency throughout, and the final拒绝 of Elena’s worldview is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The druid’s guardedness and hunger for hidden truth drive every beat; the interior contradiction between emotional armor and the need to unburden is relentlessly embodied. Micro-choices—tightening grip on the seed, stepping into cold water—reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost. The final “unbend” is earned by accumulated pain and the seed’s sacrifice. Only the slightest diagnostic tinge (“the guilt had frozen him”) keeps this out of the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—root-bound yet visionary—drives every beat; the scar-link is both wound and key, embodying the cost. His “anxious elation” is shown through trembling hands, ozone scent, lung squeeze, not label-speak. The final renunciation—stepping back without forcing reunion—earns its quiet because the prior agony of tree-link makes inaction painful. Flaw: we never see him actually fail or doubt the plan; competence feels slightly too smooth for a first contact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete—“he breathed it in, his resolve hardening”—and the final bargain is a credible renunciation with visible cost (the card dissolves, roots bind wrist). Yet the “reckless idealist” tag is asserted rather than dramatized in prior beats; we are told, not shown, the recklessness that led to the burned card. The stranger remains a silhouette, so relationship-as-crucible does not apply. Still, the micro-choice to trade rather than take is tightly aligned to motive and carries embodied weight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic reverence for the stage vs. clinical cataloguing of artifacts—are dramatized in the moment he pockets the grille cloth, trading the estate’s cash value for an intangible relic. His “confidently uncertain” stance is voiced but never tested in live friction with another will, so the arc costs feeling, not relationship. Still, the renunciation of twelve grand for one scrap is a visible forfeiture that lands as earned endurance. Interiority stays concrete, free of diagnostic cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maris’s interiority is textured—cuneiform mind-set, embodied awe at the seed—but the “kindly methodical” trait is announced, not pressure-tested; no micro-choice reveals a cost for being kind. The decisive gesture of planting the seed feels more conceptual than character-forced; we are told it honors Hamid, yet her contradictory impulse (risk the station? risk her life?) stays off-page. Still, the analogical thinking is lived in perception and lends her a perceptual signature that lifts the score to high-band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The migrating-identity librarian is notionally vivid but performs no reversible choice; interiority drifts into thematic summary (“wisdom thrived in the spaces between opposites”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Smelting fish/ink is the only micro-choice, yet it feels pre-ordained, not a fresh test of Elias/Elara’s split. Cost is asserted (“centuries,” “tomorrow disappears”) rather than felt; the ending renunciation is gentle page-turning, not a path foreclosed with pain. Voice stays consistent, but passivity caps emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. the pearl’s seductive promise—are dramatized in the crystalline moment he pockets the sphere; his later micro-choice to press shells to strangers’ ears shows visible cost as he risks ridicule and forfeits lifelong anonymity. Interiority is concrete (“abandoned hopes he had buried deep within his professional armor”), embodied in the tongue-held glow and palm-traced spirals. The arc from isolated observer to vulnerable connector is earned and irreversible, with the final whispered confessions showing stasis accepted at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief, guilt, and search for self-forgiveness stay legible; his methodical note-taking and final relinquishment of the accordion feel earned. Interiority sometimes drifts into therapeutic self-label (“raw solace,” “truth-seeking river chronicler”) that dampens embodied contradiction. The emotional arc moves from frozen witness to active letting-go, satisfying the required change. Still, a few beats summarize emotion rather than dramatize it under pressure, keeping the score just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically charged but leans on atmospheric shorthand (“heart racing with cautious exuberance”) rather than embodied contradiction. The dreamer’s motivation—document before evaporation—remains consistent, yet no micro-choice visibly risks loss or alters tactics; the veil stays cosmetic, never constraining visibility or disclosure. The arc is observation across thresholds rather than a crucible that costs her anything on-page; closure insight is graceful but not earned through a prior fork where she could have failed.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clementine’s interiority is lush—her plant telepathy is embodied in the ache of “mulberry” and the molecular hum under her palm. The violin choice lands as credible renunciation because the coffee-cup prophecy has already shown her name and the emperor’s entwined; she pays with her vanished presence. The flaw: “不敢 name” drops into diagnostic-Chinese shorthand that no one thinks mid-crisis, snapping the POV lens for a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and profession-specific; the mortician’s contradictory serenity-in-obsession pulses throughout. One micro-choice—pressing the chip to the sternum—electrifies her motive. The final “quiet flame” stance is earned, but the cost is only metaphorically “felt”; we don’t see her fatigue, tremor, or price. Still, the character never leaks into diagnostic self-talk; every beat is filtered through tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s interiority is richly embodied—tracing bark grooves, feeling the hairpin pulse—yet the “kindly decisive” trait is stated more than dramatized; her final insight is earned, but the lack of external pressure or secondary character interaction keeps the arc gently internal rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Both characters’ interior contradictions are dramatized (Elian’s doubt as tool, Lyra’s rehearsed resolve cracking). Micro-choices—Elian’s lever pull, Lyra’s tear-tracked silence—carry visible cost. The shift from performance to fragile grace is legible, though the brother remains off-page; relationship crucible is therefore only implicit, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael’s backwards-aging body and centuries-old eyes create an immediate, visceral contradiction that drives every beat; his decision to withhold the lesson until Elara *arrives* at it herself is a credible, high-cost pedagogy that forecloses easier shortcuts. Elara’s micro-choice to re-enter the pond *before* she fully grasps the pattern shows interior contradiction acting in scene, not summary. The final renunciation—vanishing as *becoming* the ripple—pays off the trait-based fear that “paradox scares away most apprentices,” making the cost of mastery legible in her soaked hem and changed reflection. Relationship as crucible: Kael’s backward youth and ancient gaze mirror Elara’s forward youth and nascent timelessness, forcing a status inversion that completes when she steps onto the platform *after* him.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—calloused thumb on stone, vibration-sight—but the “singular, almost absurd” motive is declared rather than dramatized. The final attunement is earned; the arrowhead’s warmth supplies a sensory cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. Still, no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the shift is epiphanic, not conflict-driven, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his tactile feel of the keystone, the cold railing, the decision to step off into mist. Contradictory impulses (yearning for imperfect magic while fearing obsolescence) co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation of automated perfection is earned by the prior ordeal and carries visible cost: he is left wind-bruised, empty-handed, but transformed. Minor lapse: “underachieving” is stated twice; we never see a specific past failure that scarred him.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is concrete—Orion’s thigh-burn of the key, the ritualized descent—and the contradiction between outward lamplighter calm and covert obsessive quest is dramatized in micro-choice (cutting the engine at exact coordinates). The final synesthetic vision is earned by years of nightly dives and brother-loss causality, paying visible cost: dawn reveals amber gull-streaks he can finally see. Only nudge: Marina is an observer, not crucible, so relationship pressure is off-page; head-count stays clean and motive stays singular, so no deduction. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses live in-scene and the renunciation of ordinary perception forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “quietly enthusiastic” temperament is shown through her steady focus on the coins and static, but we never feel a contradictory impulse that might complicate her resolve; interiority stays on one note. The final smile is the only embodied change, and it feels more symbolic than costly—no prior flaw or doubt is dramatized that this moment visibly burns away. Motivation is coherent but static; she never risks or forfeits anything we can touch, so the arc reads as serene confirmation rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The reaper’s interior contradiction—duty vs. grief—drives every beat; the micro-choice to leave the crystallized page behind is earned by the cascade of embodied tremors, hitched breaths, and whispered names. His flaws (denial, self-punishing duty) actively shape the naming ritual, turning each crystal into a visible cost. The final smile is fragile yet credible because the story has let him bleed on the page. No stock therapy-speak; even “heartbroken” is redefined through the specific sacrifice of Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s “lukewarm” magic and brittle devotion are shown through micro-choices—tracing the viaduct, trembling hands, the hesitant drip cadence—rather than labels. The interior contradiction (naïve hope vs. admitted mediocrity) stays active in scene and drives the final renunciation: he walks away having tuned, not fixed, the world. Embodied emotion is present but slightly generalized; “earnestly naive” is repeated rather than deepened under peak pressure. Still, the earned stasis lands with visible cost—his magic spent, the river still dry—and that decisive endurance forecloses the fairy-tale cure he longed for.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    The warden’s contradictory impulses—guard versus resurrector—are alive in every beat: the sip of liqueur that both burns and comforts, the photo laid down as both offering and trap. His embodied emotion (“burning a precise, humane line”) is character-specific, not diagnostic. The final renunciation—turning away after charging the night with memory—carries visible cost under the Accumulative lens. Interiority stays concrete; no stock phrasing or safety-hedged morality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her sentimental attachment to the crystal is embodied through tactile memory rather than label. Yet the decisive moment of “pure understanding” is asserted, not dramatized; we watch the crystal vibrate but never feel her contradictory impulses collide in real time. The arc from observer to fluent speaker of nature’s language is credible, but the final transformation is narrated from outside, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The seeker’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection while embracing lethal solitude—are etched in embodied micro-moments (buckle-click, bark-braille). The final leap is earned: muscle-memory ritual + inherited talisman + silence-weight telescope into a visible forfeit of safe return. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. Cost is felt: the arbor’s whisper recedes as the voice on the radio returns—trust reclaimed at the price of perpetual falling.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ego-death numbness vs. clone-emotion polarity is embodied in gesture and jar-contact; the “searing reality” at the end pays the cost. Interiority flirts with diagnostic labels (“emotional numbness”) but converts them into synapse-firing imagery. Micro-choice chain—slam jar, pour will, accept solitude—earns the stance. Clone dissolves too cleanly for full 8+; no lingering physical echo of their grip.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s puzzle-maker mindset is vividly rendered through tactile micro-choices—loupe, calipers, soil sensor—yet the interior contradiction never fully ignites; the seed’s heartbeat mirrors his own but doesn’t force a forked decision with visible cost. The final “quietude” is more surrender than renunciation, so the emotional price feels assumed rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in every tremor of the blower and rasp of song; the contradiction between industrial violence and tender retrieval is lived, not labeled. Micro-choices—from targeting the darkest patch to the final exhausted laying-down of the cord—trace a believable arc of obsession and release. The single flaw: no interior counter-impulse once the laughter begins to move; he becomes pure conduit, blurring the cost on his body and psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sylvan’s stoic vigil and refusal to shatter the pendant dramatize his mantra “make friends with uncertainty,” giving us a credible, embodied renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—his ache is “a constant hum,” the pendant’s truth “sharp as a shard of glass”—avoiding label-speak. The dimensional-homesick trait directly shapes his tolerance of the invasive certainty, so the flaw complicates action. Cost is palpable: he swallows a foreign star of absolutism and lets it dim inside him, turning exile into chosen stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—stoic sensitivity colliding with creative destruction—drives every approximation; the final staff-feel reweights his identity with felt cost. Thirteen years of failure are shown through calloused palms, not told, and the moment he lifts the living-ember key the endurance is earned. Micro-choices (positioning shards, whispering the prayer) reveal value hierarchy without diagnostic speak. Flaw complicity is legible: he destroys the very relic that once defined his obedience, accepting exile from both church and guild.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his palm against the fragment, breath steady, moonlight in his eyes—but the “discarding assumptions” beat is asserted, not dramatized; we never see a specific assumption surrendered or its immediate cost. The arc from obsessive listener to listener-who-accepts-silence is gentle, credible, but the emotional crescendo is more lyrical assertion than crucible. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the ending renunciation carries quiet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elijah’s “resiliently positive” trait is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory action; he never doubts, snaps, or calculates cost. Interiority stays generic (“genuine satisfaction”) rather than visceral. The final beat offers Earned Stasis—he accepts permanence—but the choice is cost-free because the text never lets him want anything else. Hourglass glow is external cue, not internal fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Siran’s interiority is vivid—embodied twitches, the “tightened jaw,” the shift from precision to abandon—and his micro-choices (knotting, weaving, letting the thread sag) visibly trace the arc. Flaws and limits (perfectionism, impulse to control) generate the central mistake and its correction, so the final renunciation feels earned. No second character on stage, so relational crucible is N/A; headcount stays clean. The only softness is a faint therapeutic gloss in “he reminded himself that connection…took time,” but it’s brief and immediately grounded in fresh action.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory tug—between abyss-born pragmatism and star-yearning wonder—is shown through embodied micro-choices: sealing the suit, unclipping the link, activating the holo. The “balancedly curious” trait is more than label: it licenses him to volunteer for an impossible syllabus and charge the anchor with new symbolic weight. Interiority stays concrete and salt-stained; no therapy-speak. Only the moment he “smiles beneath the apparatus” feels slightly performed; a visible breath or jaw-click would seal the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s “persistent curiosity” is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse that costs her anything; the final heroic act feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from flaw. Interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“profound gratitude for her persistently curious nature”) instead of embodied tension. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—she simply follows the tech readings to the hidden documents. The sister-reveal is moving, yet Margaret’s absence from the scene keeps the emotional crucible off-stage, so Aria’s change is observational, not experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eliza’s contradictory fear-of-confinement / craving-for-limbo is dramatized in body (paradoxical freedom underwater) and propels the final surrender; the inherited gold fleck externalizes her mentor’s absence and her own vanishing, giving a visible cost to the transition. Interiority sometimes drifts toward poetic thesis (“she would join the others…”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction, blurring micro-choices just before dissolution; still, the endurance of self-loss lands as credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt and Aris’s digitized regret interlock cleanly; his hand trembles on the porcelain while her voice flickers in his ear, both embodied. The micro-choice to tap the shard and disrupt the ink pattern crystallizes their co-dependence. Interiority stays concrete: “porcelain shard gleamed in moonlight” shows, not tells, his fragile hold on life. The closing heartbeat count—“Seventy-two. And infinite for you”—earns a quiet renunciation of solitude; cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—copper veins warming, bone textures under fingers—yet Kaelen’s contradictory impulses stay mostly latent; the decisive moment (syllables reborn) arrives more as lyric miracle than earned crucible, so the cost feels visionary rather than personally staked.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s grief-powered quest is vivid, but the interior contradiction—rage vs. seductive levity—is summarized more than dramatized in-scene; the sister-as-punchline reveal is embodied only by a single clutch of the arrowhead, so the cost arrives but isn’t felt in his body or choice. The final renunciation (dropping the flint) is motivated, yet the micro-choice that shows him relinquishing investigative identity happens off-stage in a half-line; we see the object fall, not the psyche split. Still, his bitter drive is specific and propulsive enough to earn the 7-floor.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.7)
    The violinist’s grief-forgetting, shell-talisman choice, and final renunciation of flight (letting the shell fall) trace a credible interior arc. Emotion stays embodied in bow-weight and collarbone-ember rather than labels. Yet the statues’ nod-through-rhythm and instantaneous stone-to-dust collapse feel externally granted, not earned by flaw or mistake; the cost lands on the city, not visibly on her body/choice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid (“brittle hush…monument to stillness”), motives anchor every beat, and the mailbag/EMP bottle are embodied extensions of his risk calculus. Missing: a second character on-stage to test status, so relationship crucible is moot; also, the brother vow is backstory-only and never complicates present micro-choices, so the flaw stays abstract rather than lived. Still, his contradictory allegiance to protocol and sabotage shows in tactile parcel swaps, and the final “single stone” renunciation lands with visible fatigue—enough for a strong band but not the 9+ gate because the cost is generalized, not sharpened by an on-page relationship or fresh mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s muteness and carpentry are credibly braided; the moment he cups the halo fragment the interior contradiction—voiceless craftsman now flooded with song—peaks in embodied tremor. The final sung note is earned because every prior beat treats silence as both wound and method. Cost is legible: the song is raw, unpracticed, exposing him to the empty train and to himself. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; headroom to 9+ blocked only because the beat-to-beat micro-choices are more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    The librarian’s “sanely eccentric” contradiction is lived: she traces calculus-of-poems maps in dust, lets the scarf tighten as compass, and chooses to step into the impossible door—each micro-choice driven by her stated mission. Interiority stays concrete (“felt a flicker of recognition,” “the scarf tightened…not as a warning, but as a compass”) without diagnostic labels. Flawed obsession complicates the final act—she leaves the patrons behind, accepting eternal caretaker exile—cost is visible in the closing image of the scarf now “woven with the threads of countless tales.” The reawakening is both triumph and life-sentence; the endurance is earned, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Librarian’s interiority is lyrically rendered but generic—no idiosyncratic contradiction or micro-choice until the palm-to-palette beat. Emotion stays atmospheric (“a sudden swell of belonging”) rather than embodied friction. The final stance is crystallized, but cost is diffuse; no path is foreclosed with visible price, so renunciation reads as gentle acceptance rather than Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The locksmith’s interior contradiction—timid exterior vs. cosmic audacity—is dramatized in the moment he lifts the hair and decides to hum reality open. His micro-choice to match the glass-harmonica note visibly costs him as the workshop geometry warps and lavender suffocates him, embodying the fear he must swallow to free “enough.” The earned renunciation lands: he restores the now-grey ribbon to the bench, the lost scent the price of liberation. One slip: “unassumingly bold” is asserted twice; let the contradiction play only through action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. wonder-struck child—surfaces early and tightens at the mushroom. The decision to stay and map “broken constellations” is the only path her twin drives allow, so the cost feels inevitable. One slip: “chronically curious” is asserted twice rather than dramatized in gesture, a micro-label—still, embodied urgency in kneeling/thermos/hand on glass keeps her above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—tender protectiveness versus tactical detachment—are dramatized in her backward steps and the tremor in her hands on the glass; the moment she chooses to speak the activation words crystallizes a cost: Marcus’s twenty lost years that she now owns. The shard-mirror reflections literalize her fractured mentor identity and feed the closure image. Status shift is legible in the final shared stance, but the beat of Marcus’s interior reaction is summarized, not embodied, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elianor’s motive—preserve wonder via the Chroma Blossom—remains legible and personal, but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“radiant hush,” “color of wonder”) that blurs contradiction or cost. No second character appears, so status crucible is waived; her micro-choice to release essence is embodied and stakes-relevant, yet the beat feels frictionless—no visible flaw or doubt complicates success. Earned stasis is present, but the absence of a test that could fail keeps the arc emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s mask-restorer lens (“I saw them daily in my shop”) gives his interiority a sharp, vocational POV that charges the final image. Micro-choices—needle angle, finger steadiness under rising silence—track credible artisan tension. One slip: the late, told-not-shown moral (“never truly been about mending facades”) lands as tidy epiphany rather than embodied contradiction, blunting cost. Still, the hierarchy of values (repair vs. release) is dramatized across six knot-beats with visible tactile stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through the meticulous video alignment and meteorite ritual, but the interior contradiction never becomes a live dilemma; the moment of shielded openness is announced rather than dramatized, so the micro-choice that costs him something is missing. The closure is a lyrical epiphany, not an earned renunciation, so the required visible cost is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quietly analytic trait is visible in how he handles the transmissions and the snow globe, but the interior contradiction—his need to understand letting go while clinging to data—never quite combusts in a single micro-choice that costs him. Arthur/Death functions as a sounding board rather than a crucible, so the status shift is intellectual, not visceral. The final renunciation is telegraphed rather than dramatized with a tangible forfeiture, so the cost feels conceptual, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The balladeer’s interiority is poetic but abstract; contradictory impulses (yearning to speak vs. solitude) are announced, not dramatized. Micro-choices—dip brush, align plate—are present yet feel ritual, not risky. No tangible cost is paid; the storm window closes but he simply “smiled,” leaving path foreclosed only atmospherically, not personally.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s curiosity and quiet yearning are sketched in visible micro-choices (bending for the goggles, page-turning in the lift). Yet her interiority drifts into explanatory abstracts (“motivation had always been to seek…”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction; the final beat accepts legacy rather than actively staking new risk, so the change feels inherited, not personally forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief-tinged obsession and embodied micro-choices (naming clouds after the cable, adjusting the telescope) keep interiority concrete; the contradiction between scientific cataloguing and raw loss is dramatized, not told. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Final renunciation—accepting drift as wholeness—earns its cost through the spooled motif and fogged lens, though the beat is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s face-blindness is never used to complicate a single beat—no misrecognition, no social friction, no tactical error—so the trait reads as label-only. His “greatest portrait” claim feels unearned because the sky-moment is pure success without a visible cost or renunciation tied to his flaw. Interiority is vivid (“hands raw,” “heart pounding”) but never contradictory; we get no simultaneous doubt/elation that would fracture his calm. The coin’s indentations map the mechanism but not Elias’s psyche, so the emotional stakes stay safely external.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s diligent curiosity is dramatized through kneeling, tracing, cross-referencing—micro-choices that cost him social safety and foreclose remaining an anonymous apprentice. Interiority is concrete (“breath caught in his throat”) rather than labeled. The ending renunciation of anonymity is earned by these prior acts, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The locksmith shows interior contradiction—yearning for mastery while fearing the mirror’s verdict—but the shift from “fixing clocks” to “fixing herself” is asserted, not dramatized. The mirror’s father-memory is vivid, yet her present-tense micro-choices under pressure stay abstract (“worked quickly, her movements precise”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values. The arc lands as Earned Stasis, cost visible in melting frost, but causality between gear-click and self-repair is more symbolic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Gardener’s motivation is clear—restore the planet before the air fails—but she acts as benevolent stage-manager, never under pressure or contradictory. The living settlers remain a pleasant collective “we”; no individual interiority or micro-choice is dramatized, so the required “character under pressure” is missing. What saves the score is the communal arc from suspicion to caretakership, a credible renunciation of extractive habits, paid for in sweat and dawn chalk duty. Still, the ghost’s altruism is declared, not tested, and no settler is forced to choose between self-interest and the gardens—so the cost feels generalized, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The adjuster’s lone, ritual ascent gives us embodied micro-choices (tracing grooves, pressing cracked porcelain to glass) that externalize his interior contradiction—obedience to delay versus gift of eternal song. The broken puppet head functions as a charged extension of self, its fractures literalizing his own damage and memory-load; pressing it to the pane is a credible, costly act that forecloses retreat. Missing is any contradiction inside the beat: he never questions the plan or reveals a counter-desire, so the “decision” feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Still, the endurance of singing until dissolution is an earned stasis whose cost (final annihilation) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tomas’s reluctant caretaker interiority is vivid—gnarled trees, bronze birds, inherited blueprint—but his contradictory impulses (save strangers while feeding the orchard) stay stated rather than enacted in-scene; the single micro-choice (triggering the device) is earned yet emotionally underplayed, so the cost feels legible but not viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—dreaming of biomedical polymers yet bound by corporate patents—grounds every beat; the “loosened grief” image is embodied in the tactile pocketing of the chrysalis. Her micro-choice to trace river foam until the polymer variant insight arrives is credible, specific, and alters tactics. The brother remains off-stage, so status/relationship crucible is muted, but the self-split is sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm, transactional interiority is consistent and specific—his shrug “Regret is just another story waiting to be bottled” crystallizes a worldview. Micro-choices (tracing palm lines, sealing bottles) reveal hierarchy of values, but no internal contradiction is dramatized; he never flinches at his own complicity. The two customers are sketched only as hollowed vessels, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Earned stasis arrives—he accepts perpetual intermediary role—but cost is intellectual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Chef Kael’s contradictory motives—needing to taste others’ remorse while fearing his own—are dramatized in every tactile choice (gripping parapet, plunging hands into impossible water). Memory-tasting and emotional contagion are never abstract labels; they manifest as salt on tongue and tremor in wrists. The final renunciation lands with cost: his gift still works, but the bitter edge is dulled, the price felt in the same sensory register that opened the story. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak, and the inherited flaw drives the inevitable mistake and its partial cure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s empathetically decisive nature and her 30-year investment in the cuckoo weight anchor her interiority; the midnight broadcast is the earned, costly culmination of that arc. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page—she glides from prep to triumph—so the choice feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Still, her tactile handling of the weight and multilingual code-switching show a singular, non-stock personality. The lifelong stakes and communal payoff supply visible cost, meeting the 9+ quick test minus the missing beat of internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “helix-minded” lens shows in how she arrays gear, links DNA to orbital mechanics, and treats the canyon as synapse. The archeologist-of-abandoned-dreams motive is declared early and repeatedly, but her only micro-choices are activating the rig and later packing up; neither tests nor visibly costs her. The broken mirror’s “multiple viewpoints” parallel is neat, yet she never resists, doubts, or pays a physical/neural price, so the transformation feels foregone rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s prism-mind is shown in sensory-rich, embodied beats (“refracting every line into layers”), but her interiority tilts toward abstract diagnosis (“latent blaze of purpose”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. She acts—tracing, gathering, integrating—yet the stakes jump from scholarly curiosity to cosmic guardianship without an on-page cost that scalably forecloses a path. The final stance (“work had only begun”) is credible endurance, but the emotional price feels generalized rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Eliara’s contradictory impulses—her reverence for silence vs. her need to break it—are embodied in every micro-choice (pressing the insulator, slowing the strum). The final renunciation of perpetual song is earned: she lulls the sculpture back to rest, paying the cost of impermanence. Interiority is concrete (“porcelain insulator cool against her palm”) and never drifts into label-speak. One flaw: the hedgehog’s ears are ventriloquized without POV filter, a tiny leakage, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and character-specific; the basalt stone as tactile map and the “translator of silence” identity crystallize Elias’s new self. The eclipse backstory is anchored to present stimuli (stone dent) and drives the final renunciation. Emotions stay embodied and contradictory—hopeful melancholy, not tidy redemption—earning the ending. A hairline slip: the single mention of “political” exile is label-speak; dramatized hint would strengthen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silen’s pacifist ethos is concretely embodied in their refusal to force the diary open, instead tuning frequencies—an externalized micro-choice that costs time and risk. Interiority is rich and particular: “the oscilloscope's green line pulse with mathematical precision while their heart beat with artistic intuition.” Internal conflict is dramatized: the ticking fireworks clock versus the need for silence. The only drag is slight gestural repetition (“theatrical yet sincere” appears twice); still, the final smile carries earned cost as the stillness shatters.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction between serenity-seeking and obsessive nightly vigil is present but stays summary; no moment of simultaneous impulse in-scene. The final renunciation—sharing seeds and porch ritual—lands with visible communal cost, satisfying earned stasis. Olfactory gift is concrete (diagnosing ailments) but never complicates her choice under pressure; it’s a super-power without drawback. Micro-choices remain ritualized rather than risk-laden; the corpse flower never threatens failure or forces a wrenching trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s curiosity and pilot instincts are credibly fused; every beat on the inverted rivers is filtered through her trained perception, and the final vow to “return as a student” crystallizes an earned stance. Interiority stays concrete (“the hum of her vessel a familiar anchor”) without drifting into explanatory labels. The only flaw: we glimpse no contradictory impulse mid-scene; her drive is single-track, muting the contradiction test for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is concrete—flight patch prickles, fingers tremor—but the epiphany that “silence is a weapon” arrives as a labeled summary rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choice is present (kneeling to sample soil) yet the final renunciation is only asserted, not dramatized with felt cost. Competence is well-sketched, but struggle stays intellectual; emotional stakes plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell ringer’s interiority is lyrically embodied—colors burst as tastes, sounds bloom as hues—so the synesthetic lens feels lived, not labeled. Yet the motivation to “certify wonder as essential” remains an abstract thesis, never sharpened into a concrete personal stake; we see no private cost or flaw that would make renunciation painful. Consequently the final Earned Stasis—walking away cloaked in cavern-song—lands as beautiful image rather than charged choice. Inner contradiction appears only in fleeting “repose vs. urgency,” not in a visible dilemma that forces a forked path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Keeper’s guilt and need to confront failure are vivid, but interiority slips into abstract self-diagnosis (“harvest insights from failure”) rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to uncase the flute carries cost, yet the emotional shift from shame to resolve feels summarized, not dramatized in scene. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is NA. Voice remains coherent, but the peak beat leans on therapeutic label-speak, damping embodied credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—empathy as math vs. the halo’s dissolve into feeling—drives the arc, but the borrowed-personality trait is asserted more than dramatized; only at the end do we feel cost when the borrowed skins melt. The micro-choice to press the fragment into his chest crystallizes values, yet earlier “transposed empathy” beats are summary, not embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    The courier’s interiority is largely filtered through lyrical exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the “jittery” trait is asserted repeatedly but never complicates a consequential choice. The mentor’s absence motivates the emotional frame but does not force a visible trade-off or mistake that alters tactics. The final shift to “moving differently” is declared, not dramatized with a micro-choice whose cost we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s obsessive interiority is rendered in concrete, body-level detail (prism vibration up the arm, forehead pressed to quartz). The contradiction between scholarly detachment and raw need is kept alive in-scene; the final “truthful lie” renunciation is earned by the prior sensory build. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived. Micro-choices (raising prism, palm on hood) visibly enact the hierarchy: proof > personal cost. Flaw: motivation stated early but never seriously tested or doubted; no visible mistake or blind-spot compounds—cost is atmospheric, not character-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief-rooted resolve is viscerally embodied; the amber bead’s warmth against her bleeding palm makes the brother-motive physical. Interior contradiction is strong: she both masters and is consumed by the raveling silence. Micro-choice hierarchy—picking up puzzle edges, knotting memory-threads—shows sacrifice scaling with pressure. The final “wait” is an earned renunciation whose cost (collapsed body, flaring bead) locks the path.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quietly determined fire is shown through embodied micro-choices—collecting labeled fragments, descending without a torch, the deliberate circle—so the interior contradiction is present. The final kneel and tear-charged eyes sell the cost, but the “rubble within himself” line drifts toward diagnostic-speak, blunting peak embodiment. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. Overall, a credible arc from meek to purposefully transformed, but the interior language could be more concrete at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s need to excavate a “withheld truth” drives every beat; his synesthetic mapping of walls/air gives interior contradiction (“a skill both curse and salvation”) and embodied cost. The micro-choice to nudge the datapad probability is credible, irreversible, and paid for immediately by the shard burning hot. The only flaw: near-total absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics idle and flattens crucible pressure. Still, the interior map-maker voice is specific, flawed, and changed at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jonah’s reticence and observant warmth are shown through embodied micro-choices (slipping sea-glass into pocket, stacking stones) rather than labels. The anonymous-letter engine externalizes his loneliness and drives every beat, so his final silent triangle carries earned cost. Interior contradiction is legible—he both clings to solitude and craves the unseen correspondent—yet the climax is a quiet gesture rather than a new tactical risk, keeping the arc just shy of a decisive change. Still, the character reads as an individual, not a trope, and the flaw (silence-as-shield) complicates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kaelen’s laughter and “storm-herald” label are repeated but never embodied in contradictory action; interiority drifts into cosmic exposition (“beautiful chaos”) rather than micro-choice. No visible cost or renunciation attaches to the midnight ritual; the closing “softened laughter” merely restates the opening mood. Character functions as atmospheric camera, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—dye-stained hands, heart-beat sync with the wing—yet the “donation” question is answered too smoothly; no lingering contradiction or cost is embodied in the final quiet beat, so renunciation feels pre-sorted rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s curiosity about trees is stated early and re-appears in the final notebook entry, giving the arc a single, legible through-line. Interiority stays concrete—tools clink, hands tremble—avoiding label-speak. Yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the character never hesitates, fears, or risks anything tangible, so the “cost” is purely conceptual. The result is competent but not crucible-level characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Keeper’s interior contradiction—fragile conviction vs. memory fracture—threads the lute-play; embodied shivers & cupped-glow micro-choices chain to final communal chorus. Cost earned: “his scattered memories now a constellation” (CR). Flaw: diagnostic phrasing “he remembered his purpose” floats above visceral beat; once, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—compassion vs. self-protection—are dramatized in every micro-gesture (smoothing the invitation, locking books away). The hide ritual crystallizes her hierarchy of values: safety > community, yet she still steps outside. The final choice is earned: her earlier disaster with patients foreshadows why emergence costs. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only ding: emotional arithmetic is a touch tidy at the mirror beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers on moss, shawl-adjusting as self-soothing—but “creeping normality noticer” is asserted not shown in micro-choices. The bread momentarily charges her stance, yet the trait never complicates tactics; the old man’s arrival and her instant steady voice flatten the flaw/pressure nexus. Still, the final smile is credibly small, earned, and costly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is continuously embodied in micro-actions—steady hands, calibrated breath crystals, murmured frequencies—so motive and method fuse. No contradictory interiority, but because every beat is filtered through the same single trait, we never feel a split-second doubt that might raise the cost; the absence of visible flaw keeps her just shy of 9-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Emmie’s steadfastness is repeatedly told (“curiously steadfast”) rather than shown through contradictory impulse; the interiority slips into label-speak (“comforting unease that defined her existence”). The final decision to preserve the truce is declared, not dramatized with visible cost—she simply “retreats with her prize,” giving us no embodied fallout. Motive is clear but flattened by summary; the father’s murder reveal should twist her stance, yet her emotional calculus stays off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her body tastes copper, glows blue, doubts while walking—and the ring’s pull forces a single irreversible step toward the amber stranger. The “luminous skeptic” contradiction stays live: she scoffs at tree elections even as her own biology proves the miracle. No head-count clutter; the second character exists only to crystallize her shift from methodical doubt to surrendered belonging, costing her the comfort of isolation. The earned stasis lands when she stays on the bluff, accepting perpetual luminous exposure as the price of community.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The charcoal-fingered artist’s memory-gift and self-loathing are viscerally embodied; every tactile smudge and tremor shows the cost of his gift. The moment he lifts the pristine charcoal—his contradictory impulses (flee vs create) crystallize in one beat, and the final stagger-back from the wall proves the renunciation is irreversible. Interiority avoids diagnostic speak; instead, “the ghosts of faces” and “molten lava” image the stakes. Only minor slip: the laughter-catalyst is summarized, not dramatized, so the flaw engine is slightly muffled.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s leaf-skin honesty tic is a vivid, embodied flaw that forces micro-choices (hiding the map fragment, confronting Marius); the wilt/gold toggle is shown, not labeled. The final decision to broadcast the lost conversations is credibly motivated by her accumulated sensory and moral pain. Marius is thin but functional as pressure conduit. Interiority occasionally drifts into thematic abstract (“crushing weight of withheld truths”) yet stays anchored to physical symptom. Meets the 9− quick test except for one stock phrase, so caps at high-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tuner’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet choosing seasonal silence—never crystallizes in a single micro-choice on the page; we watch him shape sculptures but never feel his voice trying to break free. His “faint flicker” smile is the only embodied emotion, repeated rather than deepened. The final descent is credible renunciation, yet the cost of returning to speech is only asserted, not tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    L-734’s interior contradiction—mechanical caretaker coding against rising static and memory bleed—is dramatized in tactile beats (trembling hands, paused circuits). The final integration of compressed fear into a seed is earned by prior fragmentation; the cost (loss of glass-dome captivity, chronometer chaos) is visible. Micro-choices are embedded in action rather than diagnostics, though a few “fragmented wholeness” abstractions flirt with label-speak. Still, the android’s arc from caretaker to self-combusting carrier of transformed fear lands with credible renunciation and felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is warm and consistent—“the past speaks in patterns”—but never surprises us; contradictions are announced, not dramatized. The beat where he pockets the locket and vows to “continue her work” is pure summary; we witness no micro-choice that costs him anything. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s calm-defiant stance is shown through her underwater ballet of code, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the “thrill of breakthrough” is label-only, not embodied. Mentor relationship is off-stage, so no crucible pressure; the dice gift is backstory summary, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Final line of poetry is a declared renunciation without on-page cost—the guards’ “momentary trance” resets rather than alters status. Competent archetype execution, yet no visible flaw or price that makes the victory feel earned under water-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet, ritual-driven interiority is vivid—her micro-choice to kneel and arrange the wildflowers crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The remembered chant she “didn’t know she remembered” is a hairline slip toward convenient epiphany, but it is dramatized with embodied cost (tear, trembling petals). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Endurance of gravitational flux and memory retrieval is earned and forecloses return to ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.7)
    The summoner’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains abstract; we never feel a concrete contradiction inside him, only a serene resolve. His “mapping silence” is poetic label, not dramatized micro-choice under pressure. The final absorption of the crane-disk is calm acceptance, not a renunciation that visibly costs him anything on the page. Voice is vivid, but character reads more as atmospheric vessel than flawed agent.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tutor’s contradictory impulses—protective secrecy vs. the ache to be heard—are alive in every micro-gesture around the seal; Elias’s shift from interrogator to co-listener is credible because his skepticism is physically staged (leaning forward, stepping back). The final shared listening moment earns its cost: the lie forecloses her solitary claim to the buildings, yet the renunciation is felt in the cooling seal and the dawn-lit skyline. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the “patiently nimble” trait is told once, never tested under pressure, keeping this just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. surrender to the shell—are kept alive in every beat; her trembling chest, bare feet on dew, and micro-choice to “activate” crystals embody the interior war. The arc from quarantined isolation to archivist of grief is credibly earned, propelled by on-page resonance trials that visibly cost her stamina and innocence. Grandmother’s journal functions as lived-in inheritance, not exposition dump, shaping Elenas tactics. Final smile carries Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual stewardship of ghosts, foreclosing the easier option of forgetting—cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her joints ache, the thorn digs, the ink smells—yet the “calibrated treason” is stated more than dramatized; we are told she has endured but see only one flash of past winters. The final micro-choice (prick, blood, seal) crystallizes her renunciation, but the cost is slightly under-felt because the document’s downstream risk is only asserted. Still, the contradiction between holy setting and fraudulent act is held in tense, character-specific silence. A hair more dramatized fear or physical toll would have pushed this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s “richly perceptive” curse is dramatized through embodied sensory overload—wind groans, starlight, canyon echoes—rather than told. His single micro-choice (lifting the shell, singing) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: truth over self-preservation. The earned cost is the city’s first tremor, a direct consequence of his decision that forecloses anonymity. Interiority stays canyon-specific; no diagnostic label-speak mars the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“calloused from diving and delicate handling of ethereal matters” embodies vocation and vulnerability in one stroke—and her contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs compulsion to dive again) are active in the final beat. Micro-choices (caressing the melted globe, deciding to “dive again”) reliably externalize motive. The sixty-year backstory is efficiently anchored and tilted into present action. Cost is felt: each revelation “exhausts” her, but the story stops just short of dramatizing a renunciation or irreversible loss on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “scintillatingly somber” mood is tied to the damp parapet and the whisk in her hand. The contradiction between demure routine and bold night-walk is dramatized, not declared. Yet the final beat—offering the whisk to a loom no one uses—feels symbolic rather than costly; no live option is foreclosed, so the change stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya’s skeptical-professional lens is vivid early (“sharply observant eyes”), but her interiority stays mostly conceptual (“didn’t believe in curses, but did believe in patterns”). The shift from mercenary debunker to witness of wonder is legible, yet the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied—no contradictory impulse or visceral toll appears on the page. Still, her micro-choice to leave the hood off inside the pavilion foreshadows renunciation and the final reframing feels character-specific, so the arc barely earns its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. initiate—is vivid and embodied (finger on glass, forehead on glass). The final renunciation is earned: he re-tunes the prophecy and walks away, losing his sky kingdom. Interiority occasionally slides into abstract labels (“turbulence in his soul”) instead of concrete sensation, muting pressure. Still, the split heart drives every beat and the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas’s interiority is textured—his calloused fingers, the empty jars as “soldiers,” the hush of dawn ritual—but the epiphanic leap from “wistful recognition” to life-purpose is declared, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; the pivot is pure summary. The micro-choices that follow (grabbing the largest jar, sealing the song) are symbolic yet mechanically simple, lacking visible cost or risk. The closing renunciation (no longer writing for pennies) is asserted rather than enacted, so the arc feels gentle rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The engineer’s interiority is vivid—his gloved hand feeling the key bite, the tremor as he attunes—yet the “logically emotional” trait is declared more than dramatized. We see no contradictory impulse in scene; the ritual proceeds with serene competence, so the promised internal tension is only narrated. Motivation (protect the artifact) is clear and constant, but no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values or a visible cost to him personally. The arc is steady admiration rather than earned renunciation or change, so the characterization stops just short of publish-now excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “captured-star” motivation is vivid, but her interiority drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“impatience manifested in human societies”). The embodied tension is present yet never crystallizes into a decisive micro-choice under pressure; the final stance is more observed than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—methodical investigator vs. daughter undoing her father’s legacy—drives every beat; the embodied chill of lantern metal and pulse of paternal echo keep emotion carnal, not diagnostic. Micro-choices (kneel, trace wires, stand abruptly) tighten the hierarchy of values: truth > safety > filial loyalty. The closure renunciation—stepping into daylight while still carrying the lantern—earns its cost via earlier causality: only because she deciphers the sabotage pattern can she reject the inherited script. Flaw complicity is present but not compounded; her calm never cracks into implausible hysteria, yet the moral ambiguity of using老爸’s tools to indict him stays tacit, keeping her human.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s guilt-driven caretaking is visceral—“haunted his every waking moment,” breath held “tight in his chest”—but the interiority flirts with clinical self-diagnosis (“profoundly unsettled”) and the final beat slides toward thematic summary rather than a last embodied cost. Silas remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is off the table; Elias’s own contradiction (trusting the gift vs. fearing it) is alive in micro-gestures yet never quite detonates. The earned shift to “guardian of the beautiful, fragile moments” is credible but telegraphed early, blunting the sting. Still, every physical handling of the heart is tethered to motive, and the refusal to let apology become extinction lands with visible, if muted, price.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Zephyr’s “yearning algorithm” supplies a clear, escalating motive, and the final pivot toward the Silent Bell is credibly foreshadowed. Interiority, however, is filtered through ornate exposition rather than moment-by-moment perception; we’re told curiosity “surged” but never shown how that surges alters micro-movements or sensor priority. The absence of contradictory impulse keeps the drive single-note; the only cost named is the abstract “transformation,” not a concrete forfeit. Still, the machine-as-protagonist feels individual, not stock, and the 1,347-day counter lends specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s obsession is concrete—he chases metadata ghosts and fabricates audits—but interiority occasionally slides into label-speak (“his motivation shifted from professional curiosity to a personal quest”). The final broadcast choice is earned by the breadcrumb trail, yet the turn lacks embodied cost on the page; we are told he “made his choice” rather than feeling the price.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Shael’s interior contradiction—shadow-laced yet empathetically open—remains credible under pressure; the calm intuition trait enables the micro-choice to press the final shard, but the lack of any visible physical or emotional cost after reconstitution blunts the earned-change punch. Still, the anomaly identity and paradoxical nature are dramatized, not merely labeled, sustaining high-band character work.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arthur’s interior contradiction—seeking finality yet flinching from silence—remains vivid; the parasol-tip micro-choice anchors him without tidy epiphany. The “fold in patience” is felt, not labeled, in his shift from eavesdropping on endings to hearing continuance. Cost is legible: the sterile Zurich memory is renounced, the new rhythm accepted with the warmed ivory pressed to palm. No diagnostic speak; voice stays idiosyncratic and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sentinel’s motivation is clear, but Lila and Marc remain archetypes: no interior contradiction, no micro-choice that costs them anything. Their reconciliation is triggered by an external prop, not by an irreversible decision that reveals hierarchy of values. Because the couple’s arc is the emotional stakes, their thinness caps Q1.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line walker’s motivation—preserve the echo of wisdom—remains steady and is dramatized through embodied ritual rather than label-speak. His final kneeling reprise, paying cost in fatigue and the abandoned mask, earns the closure beat. Interiority is thin but consistent with a monk-like figure; contradictory impulses surface only obliquely (“strangely honest” nature pulling him back). Still, the micro-choice to consecrate silence as well as words crystallizes a hierarchy of values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s quiet obsession and “moth-in-a-jar” secret give him a distinct interior life; his micro-choices—unclasping the case, layering photos, stepping back—track a believable arc from private ritual to public revelation. The calm trait never slips even at the climax, showing credible self-consistency. Cost is present but oblique: he forfeits solitude and any future use of the case, yet the forfeiture is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the score just under the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scholar’s interior contradiction—yearning for answers while fearing their silence—is dramatized through micro-choices (whispering “Growth,” then “Silence”). His palm against the glass and the tremor-free final clasp embody embodied cost; the refusal to publish or share is Earned Stasis with felt weight. Flaw: no secondary pressure, so status dynamics untested; still, his solitary arc satisfies single-POV demands.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness is dramatized through the chalk anchor and the physical ritual; the interior contradiction between seer and amnesiac is felt in every beat. The final chalk tracing on the rusted hood shows a micro-choice that costs him the last grip on the memory he just captured—visible, painful, earned. The only bar to 9.0 is a slight surplus of lyric summary in the penultimate paragraph that cushions the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s calm, repairer’s reflexes feel lived-in; the leaf-listening micro-choice (timing the clock to the leaf’s landing) crystallizes his interior contradiction between mechanical order and lunar entropy. The moment he collapses against the wall, chest heaving, supplies visible cost and earned endurance. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority stays consistent, though “luminous ache” edges toward register drift. Overall, a credible, flawed competence that pays its final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elijah’s serene decisiveness is shown through calm micro-choices (gentle hymn, careful placing of shard); the kindness carries visible cost as he absorbs Hale’s grief. Interiority stays concrete—cool guitar wood, tight chest—never drifting into therapist-speak. The final renunciation of a perfect repair in favor of symbolic reunion is earned by the patient accumulation of quiet acts, giving the needed “visible cost” for >8.8 candidacy, though the emotional contradiction could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s calmly obsessive focus feels consistent and specific—“quietly deliberate” fingers, steady hands while heart hammers—yet her interiority stays in descriptive, slightly generic “mystery-scholar” register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the micro-choice hierarchy is asserted rather than performed. The moment she slams the console is the only visible decision that costs her physically; earlier calibration steps read as competent procedure, not flaw-driven error. The ending stance (resolve to keep hunting) is credible, but the cost is atmospheric, not character-internal. Still, the lens of lone academic obsession is vivid enough to propel every beat without head-count clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. openness to the impossible—are dramatized in the moment she surrenders the tooth; the cost is the loss of her talismanic certainty, felt in the garden’s dimming. The child’s ancient weight is shown, not labeled, through gesture and dialogue. Interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the final micro-choice is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the stars yet choosing earthbound service—are palpable in her micro-gesture of placing the glass; the renunciation costs her the chance to keep the talisman, making the endurance earned. Interiority stays concrete through sea-glass touch and salt-air breath; no stock “epiphany” lines. Only one character on stage, so relationship crucible absent; flaw (patient stillness) directly enables the final gift, not balanced by visible mistake. Meets 9− gate: contradictory in-scene impulse + causal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her grip on the amber, the shaky exhale, the micro-choice to unclasp and share it—embodies “protected vulnerability” without label-speak. The contradictory impulse (guard vs. reach-out) plays out in a single gesture, earning the later moment of shared sanctuary. Maya is sketched only enough to apply pressure and mirror status, not dilute focus. Cost is felt: the hush literally thins when her privacy is breached, a price foreshadowed and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interior contradiction is present (writer-block vs. calling to collect hopes), but the shift is narrated rather than dramatized in scene; the “I solemnize” beat is the only micro-choice we watch, and it arrives late. Embodied emotion is lyrical rather than visceral—no bodily specifics under pressure beyond “warm” shell and “dry clothes.” Because the arc is allegorical, flaws feel safely “literary” rather than urgent; cost is conceptual, not personal, so the needed sting is muted. Closure turns on renunciation of old writer-self, but that self was sketched in summary, so the forfeiture is understood, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to mend the ancestral silence yet fearing its weight—surface only in summary, not in embodied beat-level choice. The moment he whispers “Not yet” to the vine, then yields to the moon’s pulse, is the single micro-choice that visibly costs him, earning the closure. Prior beats show gentle curiosity rather than stakes-heightening flaw or risk. Interiority is lyrical but thinly particular; we learn he is “whimsical” more from label than from idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kaelen’s calm, ritualized precision convinces as an alchemist’s signature; the “heartbeat-map” motive is announced early and re-asserted in the final resin seal, giving his labor a visible cost. Yet the text keeps him a solitary priest, never letting a contradictory impulse or human flaw break the ceremonial surface; interiority is more liturgical than psychologically specific. The resulting stance is credible but static—earned endurance rather than earned change—so the arc feels processional rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s quiet, methodical nature is consistently rendered through embodied detail—peripheral vision, brass-fitting fingers—yet the interior contradiction between “store wonder” and the cavern’s fading magic is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat. The final act of boxing the crystal is credible, but the cost feels administrative, not visceral; we see no moment where he forfeits an alternative path. Competence overshadows flaw; the risk of failure is theoretical, so the earned quality of his quiet smile is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly fractal-specific (“mathematical patterns that governed the boundaries between worlds”), but her moment of irrevocable calcification is narrated more than embodied; we’re told she “arranged her body according to impossible geometries” rather than feeling muscles lock or lungs stall. The contradiction between mortal terror and abstract exultation is asserted, not dramatized, so the final endurance reads as conceptually earned rather than somatically costed.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—calloused fingers, the weight of tools, the kettle’s whistle pacing her grief-work—yet the “here and gone” paradox is stated more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene to complicate her steady progress. The carving motion itself is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her anything (shavings “like soft snow”), so the final Earned Stasis feels proportionate but not surprising. Secondary pressure (absent Tomas) is purely atmospheric; no live relationship forces a status shift. Meets the 9+ quick test at 7.9 because the renunciation is credibly rooted in the embodied ritual, yet lacks a second, clashing desire to push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clutching the wheel while trying to exile his own ghost—play out in continuous, embodied beats. The micro-choice to crush the wheel into mist is both renunciation and self-indictment, paying the cost of “eroded ambitions” with physical pain. Interiority stays concrete: “the plastic cool against his palms,” not abstract regret. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: he forecloses nostalgia yet remains scarred, ghost quiet but not erased—an unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait anchor her every micro-choice; the sextant piece reappears in hand and pocket, grounding her lineage and motive. She acts alone, so status crucible is N/A; interiority is tactile (“smudged with grease and determination”) rather than diagnostic. The single beat of redirecting water through etched grooves crystallizes her value hierarchy: heritage repurposed into civic renewal, with the faint vibration of the brass fragment as the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—duty to silence vs. hunger for sound—stays vivid in embodied micro-choices (bare foot flex, single hummed note). The climactic renunciation of regret is foreshadowed by early tactile memory, so the shift feels earned. Flaw: “excruciatingly gentle” is repeated until it becomes mannerism, blunting the idiosyncrasy of his gait.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interiority—his shift from treasure hunter to archaeologist of deceit—remains embodied in cold water on his wrist, the brass warmth of the sundial, the mud’s drag. The contradictory pull between wanting the legend true and needing it false plays out in micro-choices: trailing a hand to “listen” to the canal, refusing sonar, easing the hook rather than yanking. The final renunciation (letting the myth die) carries visible cost: his life’s narrative is rewritten in one bruised-purple dawn. Flaw: the “architecture of lies” line is one step into diagnostic-speak; still, the beat lands because the body is still cold and the radio chatter re-anchors mundanity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s collector identity is lightly sketched (pouch, seeds) but never tested under pressure; his “infinite patience” is asserted, not embodied in micro-choices. The weaver’s gnarled hands and wave-smoothed voice give tactile individuality, yet status shift is only hinted. Interiority stays atmospheric rather than contradictory, so motivation feels steady but not scalding. Closure image of “quiet, brilliant heart” lands as CR, not character-driven renunciation—cost is conceptual, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation as living-obituary writer is a vivid contradiction that drives every beat; his decision to stay and write the gardener rather than leave on the last ship crystallizes his own “explained absence.” Interiority is sensory and specific—“calloused hands…pruning rose stems as if they might reply”—never lapsing into label-speak. The arc does not require a second on-page character; Elias’s stance toward the gardener is the crucible, and his final solitude is the earned cost. Flaw: the gardener’s backstory is recounted more than dramatized, so the deepest emotional pressure is vicarious rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s longing is vivid—grease-stained robes, trembling hands cradling the egg—but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“What if they meant to die beautifully?”) that tells us the stakes rather than dramatizing a fresh contradiction. The final smile-and-fall registers as earned renunciation, yet the micro-choice that commits him (placing the egg in the coil) is summarized, not felt in the body. Still, the singular obsession holds and the cost is legible, satisfying the 9− quick test boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied emotion, arsonist-daughter contradiction, and micro-choices (kneeling, tying coin) all act on present tension. Yet no second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is moot; the arc is endurance rather than change, so closure cost feels conceptual, not personal. Flaws (inherited vigilance, need to “prove scars sing”) drive every beat, but the final stance is poise, not renunciation; cost is abstract. Voice remains consistent and specific, but the absence of live opposition keeps pressure internal and limits upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s “luminous skeptic” paradox is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—pressing his ear to stone, fingers brushing the coin—so the trait is more than a label. The internal contradiction (starlight vs. doubt) stays active in scene and drives the final release of memories. The cost is legible: he abandons the emptied, vibrant box, renouncing possession itself. One hairline slip: “realistically imaginative” is asserted once without being tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentimentalist’s contradictory pull—vow of fireless light vs. fear of quantified beauty—embodies motive in every beat; its trembling hand on the gear is a micro-choice that costs the old lullaby. The renunciation of pure chaos is felt, yet interiority drifts toward cosmic lyricism that edges into diagnostic-speak (“weight of it all”), blunting full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’ interior contradiction—stoic artisan vs. seeker of communal grief—is palpable in the micro-choice to carve migration trails instead of names; embodied tension in fingertips on granite and ribbon. The spectral grandfather functions less as a second character than as a refracted aspect of Elias’ memory, so relationship-as-crucible is waived. Motive stays anchored to “shape of collective grief,” powering every chisel stroke; the only flaw is a glancing therapeutic self-label (“he knew he had found what he was looking for”) that slightly dilutes rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—devotion to duty vs. the need to forgive himself—drives every beat. The embodied ritual with rake handle micro-choices shows hierarchy of values. Final absorption of shame into pendulum motion is earned by prior causality, visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s cheerful exterior collides with his secret nocturnal vocation, giving him a crisp contradiction that drives every beat; the moment he names the thread “Captain Foster” we feel a lifetime of solitary practice in his fingertips, so his competence is earned, not declared. His gentle, almost tender handling of the tapestry and the whispered apology to Foster show embodied emotion rather than labels. The only limit is that his internal stakes never visibly rise—no fear of failure, no clock that could cost him—so the final warmth feels more like routine satisfaction than a renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cartographer’s interior contradiction—cultivated ignorance that maps futures—remains vivid throughout, but the promised “genuine struggle” is mostly atmospheric; the feather quill trembles yet never slips, so no error compounds. His final smile feels slightly unearned because the text summarizes rather than dramatizes any visible cost of having written. Still, micro-choices (climbing, dipping, rolling the map) track cleanly and reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is credibly rooted in his trade; the crystal-handling choice dramatizes his will to “teach dust.” Yet the interiority stays atmospheric (“his heart pounded”) rather than contradictory; no genuine flaw complicates the final act, so the renunciation feels pure, not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation is evocatively fused to his grief, giving every beat of ash-handling bodily stakes; the “quiet ache of missing” is shown through trembling fingers, shallow breath, the dropped shard. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One contradiction—he claims charlatanism yet never acts from self-interest—remains undeveloped, muting full complexity. The final caress and whisper earn a credibly costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sebastian’s rational-rebel philosopher persona is consistently embodied through micro-choices—recording competing narratives, mapping sewers, aligning the cog with shadows—so the trait drives action, not just label. Interiority stays concrete and vocation-specific, avoiding therapy-speak. The final endurance (“they can’t sink it forever”) shows earned stasis with cost. Still, no second character on page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets are waived; headroom remains because the internal contradiction between philosopher and rebel could have bitten once under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is rich (“expectant resignation” crystallizes her stance), but the internal contradiction is more asserted than dramatized in-scene; her micro-choice to place the rosette back on the desk is the only visible fork. The “skeptical administration” is off-page, so no status crucible tests her. Students remain a chorus; no single secondary character applies pressure that forces her to adapt tactics. Closure is Earned Stasis: she accepts the quiet cost of persistence, but the beat is a single gesture, not a pressured fork.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical and sensory, but her contradictory impulses are narrated rather than enacted—no moment shows her simultaneously hungering to taste a memory yet fearing its cost. The “gentle rebellion” stance is declared repeatedly yet never complicates her choices on the page; she never hesitates, fails, or sacrifices anything visible. The synaptic-pruning technique is fascinating but functions as magic rather than a window into her limits or flaws; competence overshadows struggle. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized: the final distribution of seeds carries no felt forfeiture beyond the authorial claim of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s curse of involuntary truth-telling is dramatized early and shapes every interaction; the interior contradiction between needing secrecy and being forced to speak truth charges each beat. His micro-choice to hand the lacquer box to the girl is a credible renunciation that forecloses his own comfort and completes his arc. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“a curse that made his job…a peculiar form of torture”) that momentarily floats above embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s “creeping normality noticer” obsession is concrete—his fingers ‘brush the shard,’ he ‘positions the teacup on the roof,’ micro-choices that externalize an interior contradiction between scientific cataloguing and mystical hunger. Interiority is particular: “like a photograph fading in sunlight” is his idiom, never abstract label-speak. The attic renunciation costs him his prior observer distance—the house’s “groan of almost audible pleasure” forecloses future neutrality, visible cost on the page. Flaw: no second character, so status crucible bullet does not apply; headcount stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s shift from lonely sentinel to vulnerable respondent is embodied in the micro-gesture of returning the ampoule and striking the chime; the cost—exposing his immortality to human contact—lands as a tremor in the glass bubble. Interiority stays concrete (“the weight of memory,” “trembled with his every silent thought”) and avoids label-speak. The single contradiction—stone that feels warmth—reads as poetic license, not flaw. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; headroom remains because the final choice is more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every step: he keeps climbing while knowing the stairs are endless, and the chipped die is fingered until it splits—an earned, tactile cost. Interiority is specific (“the low flame” of purpose) and contradictory (hope vs. logic) rather than diagnostic. The final laugh is credible because the proofs’ labor has been shown; the healed die externalizes a change already paid for. Minor defect: the “missed-opportunity” texture is named more than dramatized, so the flaw remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s insomnia-painter identity is embodied through tactile micro-choices (mug-rim tracing, rooftop climbs) and her renunciation of canvas for leaf-painting; the contradiction between exhaustion and nocturnal creativity is held in scene. Her motive—proving strangers remember kindness—drives every beat, but the interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic abstraction (“syntax of lost languages made visible”) that dulls the edge of her desperation. No secondary character applies live pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent, yet her self-imposed test still forecloses the option of cynicism with felt cost: the leaf’s inevitable crumble. The final smile is earned because we have watched her pay for it with sleepless labor and silver dust.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her body registers the tremor as a fracture in her own bones—and her micro-choice to bake an “L” for the fresco rather than only for kin shows a values hierarchy under pressure. The contradiction between curatorial duty and communal survival is enacted, not declared. Cost is visible in the ash taste of the bread. Voice convergence with Kaelen is brief and acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV baseline met; “neatly inventive” tag is label-only without micro-choice until the cord-lift, but the final dissolution is an earned, visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“bleak exhilaration shiver”) and the contradiction between control-freak tinkerer and surrender-to-void is dramatized in the letting-go beat. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets waived; headcount clarity fine. Flaw: diagnostic self-tag “neatly inventive mind” is unearned label-speak in an otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    The interiority is vivid—“its lingering luminance still burning like a dying star against my skin”—but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are told more than enacted; the decisive turn depends on accepting the mirror-death, yet the emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied in a final micro-choice. Voice remains consistent, yet the “photographically cursed” trait never constrains an on-page action; it functions as label rather than limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prophet’s solitary, ritualized music-making gives a consistent, embodied motive—“turn obstacles into instruments”—but no interior contradiction or escalating choice ever tests that creed; the mallet strikes only fruit, never a true dilemma, so the promised “visible cost” never lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quietly-driven spiral-cartographer identity is embodied through tactile mapping and nights on the Elder dome; the paternal whistle motive anchors her risk. Micro-choices—tracing the shell crack, pressing it open, selecting the pattern-tones—track a clear hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete, never label-heavy, and the Earned Stasis (she accepts lifelong gate-watchership) carries visible fatigue and solitude. No secondary character on page means status/relationship bullets N/A; her flaw of obsessive isolation is accepted, not cured, so the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s rational-historian identity steadies every beat; his micro-choice to “sidestep” the master is perfectly in-character. The interior contradiction—rationality vs. the trembling awareness that truth will wound—is dramatized, not told. Cost is visible: the letter’s gilt edge “brushing his chest like a warning” embodies the price he already feels. Only mild safety-hedging keeps him from top-band: his flaw never quite compounds to a visible mistake before the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quiet ritualism and embodied tremor give interior contradiction; the inkwell-as-grandfather-proxy and archival urge feel lived-in and motive-deep. Cost is visible when he pockets the final note knowing water will erase it again—Earned Stasis with felt price. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets NA; single-POV interiority stays specific, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy (archive vs. surrender to tide) drives every beat; flaw (obsessive retrospection) compounds and is accepted, not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s indexing mindset—quiet, tactile, ordered—stays legible in every micro-choice (candle tilt, finger on stamp, feverish cross-referencing). The interior contradiction between scholarly detachment and the dawning awe is dramatized, not labeled. Final endurance inside the dark vault, candles dead, is a credible renunciation of surface life; cost is the literal loss of light and the irreversible reframing of history he now must live with.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s obsession is palpably embodied—every flex of finger on quartz vibrates with grief—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic shorthand (“a delusion, a beautiful madness”) that momentarily cools the forge of his contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief-numbed fix on “harvesting” lost futures is palpably embodied in the thumb-scabbed geode and the console ritual; contradictions between survivor guilt and god-builder ambition stay active throughout. Micro-choice at the descent decision crystallises his hierarchy of values on-page. One hairline slip: the leap from mapping to harvesting potential is asserted rather than shown through a beat that puts him at bodily risk or reveals a visible price paid right now—cost is thematic, not dramatised. Still, interiority is concrete, distinctly voiced, and drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kai’s interior contradiction—military past vs. belonging-quest—stays abstract (“reflected on how their career had evolved”) and never collides with an on-page micro-choice that costs something; the final surrender to frequency is asserted, not dramatized through body or tool. Perpetual-surprise label is named twice but doesn’t distort tactics or perception under pressure; the drone stall is solved by instinct, not by a visible flaw or blind spot. No relationship crucible or status shift occurs (single on-page character), so the arc is purely internal, yet internal stakes remain cognitive paraphrase rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied (the watch hand burns his palm); his contradictory drives—profit from false memories vs. need for Mara’s absolution—collide in the final invitation to the shore. Micro-choices (placing the gear on the railing, voice cracking) show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The earned shift: confessing complicity while still clinging to the ritual that got him there—inviting her into the driftwood confessional—feels both flawed and inevitable. His eidetic-yet-erased sister memory is the one unmotivated blank; it nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Julian’s interiority is rich—guilt over Zaatari is embodied in the brass pull he worries like a wound. The micro-choice to steady Mellor with the same hand that once mis-read intel visibly yokes past failure to present atonement, paying the cost of renewed vulnerability. His “uncommonly thoughtful” trait, however, is stated more than dramatized; we see calm politeness rather than risky strategic invention that could have failed. Still, the object-as-conscience device keeps contradiction alive under pressure and earns the quiet renunciation of self-loathing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tremoring hands, the compass’s weight, the salt-taste of regret—but the “merrily melancholic” mask is asserted more than dramatized. The apprentice’s death is the single strongest motivator; the rest of the regret-cloud is retold summary. Micro-choices (paddle angle, pole sightings) do align with motive, and the final self-recognition is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—self-loathing curiosity vs. terror of feeling—are dramatized in every beat: pocketing the ball, deciphering print, wading. The final surrender of the ball and lungful of lake is an earned renunciation that costs him control and perhaps life, yet offers the first authentic warmth. Interiority remains embodied (“the water cool against his skin,” “ball now weighing more than leather”) never abstractly diagnostic. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-anchored drive to resurrect Shadowpaw is vivid and embodied; her trembling hands against the cookie fortune crystallize interior cost. The metamorphosis choice is foreshadowed by the fortune’s directive, so the final surrender feels earned. Yet the “reluctant” beat is told more than dramatized—her spoken protest is the single micro-choice, limiting the contradiction we witness in scene. Still, the bond is specific enough to avoid stereotype, and the closing caress shows a hierarchy of values paid for in form.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartomancer’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals (hand-print, saucer) and drives every beat; the final renunciation—“learn to breathe again in this atmosphere of memory”—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but could be sharper under pressure. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s pacifism, lightness-when-happy trait, and archival quest are cleanly anchored; the micro-choice of drawing the crystal from a child’s tear-photo crystallizes her values. Interiority is mostly concrete, but the beat where she “extracts a single thread of light” drifts into abstract summary rather than embodied contradiction under stress. Because the final renunciation (staying aboard to secure the gate) is prepared by earlier self-confrontation beats, the arc earns its stasis, yet the lack of visible physical cost keeps the score shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives—the bottled bugs as cosmos, the itch to “feel how one moment bleeds into the next”—stay concrete and embodied; every micro-move (stumble, kneel, re-cork) is tethered to that want. The accidental prophecy mechanic is shown, not merely labeled, when the escaped bug literally drags him to the buried relics, forcing a visible, costed choice to pocket transformation instead of cash. Interior contradiction is light—no real wrestle with “why not sell the relic?”—so the arc flirts with tidy rather than truly costly renunciation, keeping it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s calmly inventive trait is stated repeatedly but only demonstrated once (aligning quill to decode sundial); interiority drifts into summary (“mind raced through possibilities”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final loyalty pivot is declared, not dramatized: we are told she “made her decision” but see no micro-choice that costs her. Bronze heirloom and lineage secrets remain abstract; emotional stakes stay generalized (“protect the fort”) instead of sharpened by personal flaw or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The herder’s isolation and precognitive curse are vivid, but her interiority drifts into generic cosmic awe (“shimmering like false dawn”) rather than embodied contradiction. The embodied moment when she presses her palms into the dust is strong, yet the prior emotional beats feel performed rather than lived. The change—understanding friction is hidden—arrives as an external download, not a crucible forged from her own misread visions; cost is conceptual, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s through-line—map the scars, dare to read aloud—stays legible; his trembling envelope-rip is a believable micro-choice under pressure. Interiority drifts into canned abstraction (“furiously tranquil,” “quiet rage”) rather than embodied contradiction, dulling specificity. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the stance crystallizes credibly, yet the cost feels pre-summarized rather than discovered in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Internal contradiction is present—Elias's mechanical arm whirs with philosophical tension—but the emotional embodiment leans on stock cues (“smiled, a flicker of chaos”) rather than raw, idiosyncratic sensation. Lyra’s entrance and the mutual fingertip brush do crystallize a hierarchy of values (intellectual parity over victory), so the Earned Stasis carries cost, yet the micro-choices leading there are mostly verbal parries, not visibly priced gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias is an appealing contradiction—poet/recycler, identity-shifter yet constant in devotion to books—and his desire to “forge beauty from anarchy” is dramatized through seed-planting and network-building. His helpful/earnest persona surfaces only in dialogue and cooperative shelving, never creating inner contradiction or visible cost; the promised monthly molt feels decorative rather than operational under pressure. Actions align with stated motives but never tighten into a crucible moment where identity instability forces a concrete trade-off; the friendship forms smoothly without status tension testing either character.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pianist’s interiority is lyrical but abstract—emotions named (“steely longing”) rather than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene. The decisive act (pressing the clock) is motivated by general nostalgia; no visible flaw or micro-choice complicates it, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Still, the single POV holds, and the ending’s quiet stasis is credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s luminous doubt is a vivid, embodied contradiction that drives every beat; his interiority is tactile (“traced…with a reverent finger,” “pulse…spread into his chest”).
    The micro-choice to whisper “Unfinished” into the void crystallizes his hierarchy of values: cultural memory over personal certainty, with the cost of permanent uncertainty legible on the page.
    No stock therapy-speak; the flaw compounds rather than resolves.
    Single-POV default met; no relationship crucible required.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kenji’s slow-spoken bonsai tutor trait is more label than embodied: his single voiced apology arrives only after 90% of the text, too late to shape prior choices. Interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“emotions have their own magnetic fields”). The 23-year pine linkage to the marriage is clever, yet the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized. Earned stasis is visible, but only just—hence solid, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in cosmic observation and trauma response—is consistent and embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., selecting fractal patterns for Mr. Gable). Her internal conflict between scientific detachment and compassionate intervention manifests subtly but credibly. However, the absence of on-page interaction with Mr. Gable limits relational crucible depth, and her flaw (over-reliance on control via dust) isn’t tested by failure—only affirmed. The final act of wiping dust reads as earned endurance, not renunciation, slightly muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, patience, and artistic identity feel specific and consistent. His motivation shifts credibly from survival to purposeful testimony, anchored in tactile actions (sweeping ash into a crucible). The “steadily adaptive” trait manifests in his quiet resilience, not just stated. However, the smuggler’s backstory remains abstracted through discovery rather than dramatized contradiction, slightly limiting full emotional reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The capsize survivor’s motivation—translating silence into music—is vividly embodied through tactile gestures, micro-choices (selecting tuning forks, striking them into plant stems), and emotional contradiction (grief and wonder coexisting). Her deafness isn’t just stated but enacted: she “whispers” unheard words, reads thermal scans instead of sound, and moves with “quiet grace.” However, her internal conflict lacks a second contradictory impulse beyond longing; her resilience feels unwavering rather than wrestled. The absence of interpersonal pressure or flawed missteps limits the depth expected at the 9+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s inadvertent stubbornness and grief-driven mission feel deeply embodied, especially in his basement repair attempts and underwater quest. His internal conflict—between exhaustion and duty—is rendered through tactile detail (“fingers trembled,” “molecule by molecule”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of solitude: he accepts ongoing unrest as part of his purpose. Mrs. Hargrove’s spectral appearance crystallizes his earned endurance without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and Lena are vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—Elias’s quiet resolve versus communal despair, Lena’s suspicion versus curiosity. Their micro-choices (packing baskets, lingering at doorsteps) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. The intergenerational friction feels lived-in, not schematic. However, secondary elders remain impressionistic, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete contradictions—rational artist opening to spiritual curiosity—and his micro-choices (breathing, opening the vial) align with his evolving motivation. The tear and camera obscura function as extensions of his psyche, not mere props. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction; the “pilgrim of sparks” identity arrives more as revelation than struggle. Still, his final act of releasing love feels earned through embodied ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and obsession, with embodied contradictions—clutching photographs while running from them, seeking texture yet trapped in reverie. His final renunciation feels earned, though the wife’s absence as an on-page character limits relational crucible depth. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, favoring sensory immersion (“fingers tightening on the fragment,” “heat searing his skin”). The cost—erasing her completely—is legible and devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—planting resilience—is vividly embodied through his raw wrists, blood-warmed chains, and desperate precision with the keys. His patiently strategic trait manifests in micro-choices: using chains as tools, recalling feather patterns under duress. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; fear and resolve coexist without tidy resolution. The final renunciation (accepting possible death to secure the vault) is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is compellingly rooted in personal loss and sensory synesthesia, and his final act feels earned. His internal contradiction (longing for connection yet immersed in absence) is embodied through tactile rituals with the forge and greenhouse. However, the sister’s departure remains abstracted; a single concrete memory would have deepened emotional specificity. The closure choice carries visible cost: he accepts that broken trust endures as sound, not silence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thief’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, aching chest, and tactile tracing of flower codes reveal yearning without therapy-speak. His motivation (“press his ear against destiny’s door”) feels consistent and deepens credibly into self-recognition. The epiphany avoids sentimentality by arising from concrete action (listening, failing, reinterpreting). However, the shift from obsession to enlightenment leans slightly on lyrical assertion rather than fully dramatized contradiction in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Finn’s interiority is richly embodied—his “thoughtfully spirited” nature manifests in micro-choices like abandoning the vase for the teardrop, embedding the bookmark as scar rather than smoothing it. His motivation—to craft “safe zones for inquiry”—is consistent and deepened by tactile memory (grandfather’s philosophy book). However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward performative introspection; the “thawing heart” concept borders on diagnostic label-speak despite being dramatized through glasswork. The final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost: the abandoned project, the preserved imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s phobia, adaptive nature, and trauma from betrayal are clearly rendered, but internal conflict often defaults to declarative summary (“his phobia screamed,” “a flicker of hope ignited”) rather than embodied contradiction in action. The final confrontation lacks visceral struggle—his victory arrives via decrypted notes and a confession, not a hard-won choice with tangible cost. Emotional progression leans tidy: fear → resolve → wholeness, without credible regression or irrationality under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, whispered rituals, and “mild obsession” contrast credibly with his predecessor’s madness. His micro-choices (e.g., accelerating work as stars vanish) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, pattern over sanity. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; his resolve tightens without internal friction, softening the cost of his final stance. The epiphany feels earned but leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“architecture of silence itself”) without sufficient prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    734’s motivation—to find where thoughts come from—is consistent, embodied through precise robotic action, and culminates in a credible renunciation of its janitorial programming. Its internal contradiction (duty vs. curiosity) manifests physically in the decision to play the violin, overriding directives. The transformation into a “sentinel of time” feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost: dissolution of self into music and loss of former identity. However, emotional embodiment remains slightly abstract—“remarkably composed” borders on label-speak without deeper sensory contradiction under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The registrar’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his preference for quiet, his pulse quickening at the doodles—and his micro-choice to step into the forecourt feels earned. The two figures remain slightly archetypal but function effectively as a crucible for the protagonist’s shift from observer to participant. Their tension and release are embodied (“shoulders knotting like tangled thread… slowly uncurling”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final gesture of accepting tea shows credible emotional progression without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—proving gardens know their gardeners—is embodied in ritual, micro-choices (polishing marbles, tending despite low luck), and a flaw (pragmatic endurance masking quiet defiance). His internal contradiction between societal devaluation and private conviction intensifies under pressure from the researcher’s skepticism. The final act of retrieving his marbles feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost legible in his trembling hands and decades of marginalization. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail like cracked marbles and withered vines.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—proving time moves sideways—is personal and consistent, driving his precise actions. His interiority is grounded in tactile detail (calloused hands, warmth of levers), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, Dr. Chen remains underdeveloped; her shift from clinical detachment to awe lacks micro-choices or contradictory impulses. The final smile feels earned, but the relationship doesn’t function as a crucible—she witnesses rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The musician’s motivation—decoding Isabella’s lost composition—is rooted in his professional identity and deepens credibly under pressure. His emotional shift from skepticism to belief feels earned, though his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; he moves smoothly from curiosity to conviction without meaningful resistance. The final choice to play the cello carries symbolic cost but no tangible sacrifice, weakening the “felt cost” requirement. His expertise is consistent, yet his flawless decoding borders on convenient competence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in visceral, embodied grief and sharpened perception; her micro-choices—touching the smudged margin, walking to the sextant—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, expressing trauma through sensory distortion (“auroral sorrow,” “colors bleeding”). The brother’s backstory is concretely anchored to present stimuli (illustration, fever-vision), and her final act of naming the truth earns an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—reckless exploration fused with guilt—is vividly embodied in tactile choices (kneeling in cold puddles, gripping the wheel) and filtered through his “religiously skeptical” worldview. His internal contradiction (dismissing psychics yet relying on their tapes) feels authentic under stress, though the epiphany leans slightly tidy. The swallowed truth as physical burden is well-concretized, but the resolution lacks a visible trade-off beyond emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—to witness change without judgment—is consistent and deeply integrated into their perception, but it yields no meaningful internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The character remains observational rather than agential; their “reality-looseness” is stated but never tested through action with cost. While interiority is richly rendered, it lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotional stakes that would elevate it beyond lyrical contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “cautious exuberance,” tactile connection to the locket, and adaptive musical choices reveal a nuanced professional identity under pressure. Leo’s silence and eventual gesture feel earned, not sentimentalized. However, his transformation leans slightly on therapeutic idealism; his first words arrive with minimal friction, softening the cost of vulnerability. The baby curls symbolize potential but risk veering into diagnostic label-speak (“pure potential”) without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aria’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “sensitively perceptive” nature, driving her to risk fragile artifacts for answers. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through embodied perception (“questions that might have answers… thrum behind her eyes”). The final choice—to record the walls’ last story and seal the tapestry—feels earned by her three-year quest, with cost implied in irreversible loss of access. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her drive lacks a countervailing impulse that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained fingers, salt on lips, the weight of orchestration—and his contradictory impulses (loneliness vs. control, obscurity vs. impact) act simultaneously. His micro-choices (rewriting the microdot, slipping the fortune) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: isolation, moral burden, perpetual disguise. The keeper’s daughter functions as an off-stage pressure point rather than a crucible, slightly limiting relational depth, but Elias’s self-contained arc remains compelling and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The priest’s motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions before possession completes—is clear and consistent, driving every action. His internal conflict is embodied through precise physical gestures (brushstrokes, pedal presses) rather than abstract introspection. However, his emotional state remains somewhat monolithic under pressure; we see resolve but little contradiction or degradation of thought. The final endurance feels earned, yet the cost—“fragile victory,” “weight settling into his bones”—is stated more than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ai’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing and micro-choices—humming at a crack in the glass, placing the shell with ritual care—that reveal his hierarchy of values. His motivation (“to become the conductor of unheard symphonies”) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; “chronological homesickness” functions as poetic shorthand but is grounded in sensory memory (mother’s humming, father’s laugh). His exhaustion at the end feels earned, a visible cost of his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his defiance of gravity, tactile grip on the tablet, and emotional weight of looping timelines feel specific. However, his motivation to “conquer the labyrinth of self” remains abstractly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in real time. The final renunciation (walking without defiance) is earned but lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His flaw—eternal recurrence—is compelling but functions more as premise than lived struggle with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is visceral and consistent—her deafness reframes sound as physical vibration, making her quest for emotional resonance through touch profoundly embodied. Her micro-choices (grinding the needle, pressing her palm to the record) reveal a hierarchy of values: sensation over perfection, chaos over silence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; numbness and hunger are rendered through concrete action, not abstraction. The final crack in her emotional shell feels earned by every precise, desperate gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meticulousness, curiosity, and integrity shape micro-choices like not confronting the tail and prying the seal with care. His final resolve feels earned, though the emotional cost of his choice remains slightly abstract. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak but leans on summary for internal conflict (“shiver of unease”) rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trembling hands, aromatically cautious nature, and grief layered with specificity (wool coat, rain, perfume) avoid diagnostic abstraction. His micro-choice to capture the ultraviolet shadow—not the primary scent—reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: sealing not just memory, but its hidden emotional architecture. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. fear of unraveling) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation isn’t of grief, but of confusion—a credible endurance earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Langdon’s ethically playful nature manifests in concrete micro-choices—pocketing the rope, braiding nooses, tying a “prayer bridge”—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His internal contradiction (desire for knowledge vs. acceptance of suffering) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of binary choice is earned by his consistent poetic worldview. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile interaction with rope, stone, and starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s interiority is richly embodied—her acoustically perceptive nature, grief, and ritualistic gestures feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (humming, placing the bowl, speaking into it) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in ancestral storytelling. The final renunciation isn’t of grief but of silence, credibly earned through tactile engagement with memory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through vibration, ash, damp wood—not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dealer’s internal conflict—professional detachment versus emergent empathy—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., tightening then releasing the blotter petal) and micro-decisions under pressure. Their motivation evolves credibly from transactional to transformative, with the final renunciation of subsuming grief carrying tangible emotional cost. The chemist’s off-page presence exerts effective secondary pressure through the petal as proxy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain tactile and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marla’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “cautious exuberance,” tempered by cargo-world pragmatism, feels specific and consistent. Her micro-choices (delivering the locket personally, initiating Frederick’s introduction, helping the elderly woman) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on quiet recognition. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her philosophy emerges through action, not exposition. However, Frederick remains underdeveloped beyond his role as beneficiary, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “luminescence aching for something he couldn’t name” grounds his motivation in sensory longing rather than abstraction. His micro-choices (binding reeds, infusing stories) directly reflect his desire to belong, and his emotional arc culminates in earned stasis: not finding community but becoming its co-creator. Elara’s “boldly sympathetic” trait manifests in action—her touch, her song—not just label. However, her interior remains slightly opaque, limiting full crucible reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—cataloguing lost beauty to defy erasure—is vividly embodied in his charcoal-smudged hands, time-borrowing rituals, and desperate skiff journey. His internal contradiction (preserving memory vs. risking annihilation) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a final choice that forecloses his existence with visible cost. The infinity pendant and tactile details ground his emotional stakes without diagnostic label-speak. His renunciation feels earned, not tidy, and aligns perfectly with the story’s causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is rooted in specific loss and expressed through embodied ritual—kneeling, tracing chipped patterns, whispering to darkness—not abstract grief. His internal conflict (desire for mathematical resolution vs. emotional ambiguity) manifests in action, not summary. The glass eyes function as both memory anchors and tools, revealing character under pressure. Final acceptance feels earned by prior causality, though the transformation leans slightly toward conceptual neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving hidden narratives and becoming visible only to kindred souls—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice, from caching the tape to selecting “The Secret Garden.” His internal contradiction (desire for connection vs. commitment to invisibility) plays out in action, not summary. The young librarian functions as a mirror, not a crucible, but her on-page presence validates his stakes without diluting focus. His kindness and methodical nature manifest as tangible trade-offs: time pressure, physical risk, emotional restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his clinical obsession, pity for the leaf, and eventual surrender feel earned and contradictory. His micro-choices (building a shield, dropping the tablet, stepping into the rain) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. The final transformation avoids diagnostic label-speak; his change emerges through sensation, not exposition. Flaws drive inevitable errors: his rigidity blinds him until failure forces participation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s insomnia, artistic drive, and yearning for meaning are embodied through tactile detail (“canvas-stained fingers,” “haggard awe”) and consistent micro-choices (following rain trails, accepting the exchange). Her internal contradiction—craving sleep yet needing wakefulness for vision—is dramatized without diagnostic label-speak. The stranger’s mirrored exhaustion deepens Elara’s arc without flattening her individuality. Final renunciation of solitude feels earned, with cost legible in her acceptance of shared witness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—her reliance on visions versus her need to experience the unknown—is embodied in tactile choices (touching walls, reaching for the pearl) and culminates in a credible transformation. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, sensations like “ice and fire” convey upheaval. The pilgrim’s presence sharpens her realization without overt exposition. Final renunciation of predictive certainty feels earned by prior sensory immersion and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“slumped shoulders,” “trembling fingers”) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values—prioritizing emotional pacing over archival completeness. Her “reactively visionary” trait drives credible, costly decisions (e.g., staggered revelations), though secondary characters like Mara remain underdeveloped crucibles. The fisherman and Kai function more as catalysts than fully pressured agents, limiting relational depth. Still, Elara’s contradictions—archivist vs. healer, order-seeker vs. fragment-embracer—are sustained with nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“breath frosted,” “trembling hands”) and consistent with his “analytically artistic” trait. His motivation—to confront buried truths—is credible and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a renunciation (walking away from the fortress) that forecloses retreat with visible cost: the dissolution of the ticket punch and the confrontation with shattered mirrors. However, the internal conflict leans slightly toward abstract epiphany (“the greatest mystery was himself”) without sufficient contradictory micro-choices mid-journey. The final endurance feels earned but borders on tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered—her skepticism, empathy, and courage coexist without contradiction. Her motivation (“for the village below”) grounds her actions in tangible stakes. The transformation from skeptic to believer feels earned through embodied experience rather than abstract epiphany. However, her flaw lacks a consequential mistake; doubt recedes too cleanly, missing an opportunity for struggle that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The immortal’s motivation—to discover “what happens after goodbye”—is vividly embodied through tactile interactions with the amulet and environment, not abstract musing. His dimensional awareness creates genuine internal contradiction: omniscience breeds ennui, yet he risks unmaking for a truth only cessation can reveal. The final act of pressing the fragment into its hollow is earned by centuries of buildup, with cost crystallized in his dissolution. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through prismatic light, magnetic tremors, and hushed thunder.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation—balancing her father’s moral debt through acts of genuine aid—is compellingly rooted in her history and drives concrete choices (e.g., gifting the ink pot). Her internal conflict between inherited skill and ethical redirection is embodied in action, not summary. Elena functions effectively as secondary pressure, but Maya’s emotional arc slightly leans on diagnostic phrasing (“mathematics of a fair trade”) without fully dramatizing the cost of that calculus in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—preserving lost moments through invented histories—is deeply rooted in the town’s erasure and rendered with emotional specificity. His “earnestly studious” trait manifests in precise rituals, not just labels, and his micro-choices (e.g., forty minutes of charting, deliberate gold-leaf application) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete (“hum vibrating through his bones,” “incandescent restraint”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits the score; his endurance is credible but lacks internal friction beyond quiet resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent: his bureaucratic erasure fuels a tactile, sensory-driven quest for memory-as-armor. His micro-choices—kneeling, tracing the label, layering stories—reveal a hierarchy of values (connection over anonymity) with felt cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, perception is filtered through poetic but concrete synesthesia (“clang…tremor of a story”). The final renunciation of seeking a “name” in favor of becoming “a cartographer of the forgotten” is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “gloomy cheerfulness,” tactile handling of the seashell, and cello-driven reimaginings reveal a layered psyche under pressure. His motivation intensifies credibly from myth-busting to existential inquiry, culminating in a renunciation of external truth-seeking for inward discovery. The final micro-choice—writing with joy instead of frustration—feels earned through prior struggle, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak mars his emotional arc; contradictions (skepticism vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior conflict—preservation vs. survival—is embodied through tactile choices (painting graffiti, clutching the stone) rather than abstract rumination. Her “orderly intuitive” trait directly enables her method, and the dual allegiance evolves credibly into synthesis. The foundation stone chip anchors micro-choices with generational weight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in his role as a dwindling breed of lunar inspector. His “purposefully curious” nature drives the breakthrough with the chemical process, showing agency under pressure. Interiority is concrete—his exhaustion, melancholy, and reverence for heritage are embodied through tactile actions (placing the sand grain, pressing against the surface). However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he’s resolute without internal friction, slightly flattening the human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s blindness is not a gimmick but a lived constraint shaping his methods and perception; his motivation—to decode feedback into direction—is embodied through tactile precision and sensory adaptation. His micro-choices (e.g., using water refraction, trusting touch over sight) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet cost: isolation, reliance on non-visual cues, the weight of responsibility. No internal contradiction is articulated as therapy-speak; emotion emerges through action—fingers dancing like a musician’s, the calm that stills the air. The final smile carries earned satisfaction, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s dry wit and scholarly obsession feel authentic, and his micro-choices—tracing condensation, cross-referencing coordinates—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in cartographic precision. His internal conflict between intellectual certainty and the uncanny remains embodied, not diagnostic. However, his transformation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional readiness; the “breaking dam” epiphany leans slightly toward unearned revelation despite strong setup. His subtly confident trait shapes decisions but doesn’t foreclose alternatives with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bell tuner’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to restore balance through sound. His actions—breathing into the fork, walking with deliberate rhythm—reveal character under pressure without over-explanation. However, interiority remains abstract (“infinitely patient grace,” “unreadable face”), offering poetic impression rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choice. The lack of internal struggle or visible cost limits emotional depth despite strong atmospheric embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motivation—rooted in her mentor’s disappearance and the perfume vial—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict between fear and duty is embodied (“override instinct”) and culminates in a credible renunciation (integration with the temple). However, her emotional arc leans slightly on summary (“clutches the vial… memories flooding”) rather than fully dramatized micro-choices, and the final transformation lacks a visible bodily or psychological cost that would ground the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is compellingly rooted in his inherited legacy of disbelief, and his internal conflict—between truth-telling and strategic silence—is embodied through tactile actions (tracing scuffs, unscrewing the lattice). His micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, agency over victimhood. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy in its resolution; the shift from cursed son to self-authored man lacks friction or doubt at the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses—mourning and elation, betrayal and devotion—are embodied through tactile details (the bead, the veil) and micro-choices (ephemeral appearances, final fading). The botanist’s dawning recognition feels earned, not diagnostic. However, his interiority remains slightly thin compared to hers; we see his reactions but not enough of his prior emotional landscape to fully weight the cost of remembrance. The “lovingly venomous” history is compelling but leans more on lyrical assertion than dramatized contradiction in the present beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—driven by poetic intuition, insomnia, and reverence for craft—is consistent and embodied through tactile details (indigo-stained fingers, kelp fiber). Her sleepwalking blurs dream and agency, making her final act feel both fated and chosen. The internal contradiction between witnessing decay and creating beauty fuels her decisive sewing. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of passive observation for active reweaving.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring faith in her lineage—is embodied through concrete action (placing the sundial base) and internal contradiction (cynicism vs. “warmly curious” hope). Her micro-choices, like trusting local laborers and interpreting the orchard’s magic, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final act feels earned, with visible emotional cost: decades of displacement crystallized in trembling hands. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elliot’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied ritual and contradiction—his yearning for analog slowness in a digital world, his belief in truth wrapped in fiction. His motivation (“discover meaning in the margins”) drives every action with consistency. However, his emotional arc lacks a decisive internal shift or cost; he endures rather than changes, which limits depth in this length. The final satisfaction feels earned but untested by opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile, sensory detail and consistent contradictions—wisdom masked as foolishness, urgency masked as calm—but his emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a path with visible cost. His actions feel inevitable rather than chosen, and the “final stitch” reads as completion, not renunciation or sacrifice. The disguise motif remains largely performative without tangible tradeoffs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The medium’s motivation is clear and consistent—her quest to recover an unspoken apology—but her internal contradiction remains abstract rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses. Emotions are embodied (“fingers trembled,” “palm warmed”), yet the emotional arc leans on lyrical assertion over visceral struggle. Her micro-choices (pressing shard to leaf, stepping into moonlight) align with motive and reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—carrying peace instead of regret—is earned, though the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his graft, anesthetic haze, and translator’s fatigue manifest in tactile, contradictory impulses. His micro-choice to engage the girl’s code reveals a hierarchy of values: connection over numbness. The child’s “shrewdly innocent” curiosity pressures him without dialogue dominance, and their dynamic crystallizes his arc from avoidance to earned engagement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels lived, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to rediscover lost joy—is sharp, embodied, and consistent, driving every micro-choice from her handling of the fresco fragment to her ritualistic painting with light. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile detail (“breath hanging like tiny ghosts,” “pensive mirth”) and emotional layering (simultaneous loss and discovery). The final renunciation—accepting ephemeral resurrection over permanent recovery—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: exhaustion, fading light, and return to solitude. No head-hopping or secondary characters dilute focus; this is a masterclass in single-POV embodiment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—her “methodically playful” rhythm, tactile engagement with the hobo nickel, and emotional shift from focus to wonder feel specific and consistent. Her motivation (restoring stories) deepens organically into a thematic embrace of curiosity over certainty. The final choice—to see the mural as music—is earned by her prior openness to whimsy and her reverence for impermanence. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphany mars her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—charm masking hardened resolve, intellectual play masking desperate defiance—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., “Artistic license” vs. planting coded marigolds). His motivation intensifies credibly from mischief to stewardship of rebellion. The final endurance (“the spark was still his to guard”) forecloses safety with visible emotional cost. Flaws like overconfidence nearly doom the group, making his pivot to doubling down feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s interiority is richly embodied—trembling fingers, aching wrists, wide eyes—but his motivation leans on abstract longing rather than contradictory impulses in-scene. His “shyly unstoppable” trait is stated but not dramatized through meaningful trade-offs under pressure. The transformation of pain into beauty feels consistent yet lacks friction; no moment shows him resisting or failing that would deepen his flaw. Final renunciation (accepting peace) is earned, but the cost of centuries of solitude remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The caretaker’s motivation is crystalline and consistent, rooted in the preservation of forgotten names, and their internal conflict—foxglove regret versus duty—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., hesitating to repair the chime, sacrificing memory for the locket). Emotions are rendered with poetic specificity (“poison-sweet,” “shoulders slumped”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the character remains slightly archetypal; their contradictions lack the granular idiosyncrasy that would push this into 9+ territory. The final endurance feels earned but leans more on atmosphere than deep psychological revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” nature is vividly embodied in her trembling fingers and bold strokes, and her motivation—to restore trust through love—is compelling. However, the second character remains underdeveloped; his presence functions more as a mirror than an agent, weakening the crucible of their relationship. The internal contradiction (reverence vs. urgency) is strong early but flattens into certainty by the climax. Her final choice feels earned, but the cost of staying—what she sacrifices to write those promises—is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The machinist’s internal conflict—duty versus guilt—is embodied through tactile interactions with the chain and envelope, avoiding diagnostic labels. His “slyly heartfelt” nature manifests in micro-choices (e.g., aligning the worn link with the basin’s drain), revealing a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Motivation intensifies coherently from encrypted compassion to recalibration. The final renunciation of rigid control is earned by prior causality and his mother’s encoded plea.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—preserving his sister’s lost lullaby through a Mars meteorite chip—is emotionally precise and consistently embodied in micro-choices (e.g., attaching the chip to the pigeon). His reinvented identity and obsessive dust-mapping feel psychologically credible, not diagnostic. The final act of release reveals contradictory impulses: control vs. surrender, isolation vs. trust. However, the backstory is slightly over-explained in reflective blocks rather than fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elea’s motivation is consistent and deeply tied to her identity as the corn maze architect’s child, with micro-choices (e.g., pressing her palm to the wood, tracing grain) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority is concrete and embodied—“featherly determined fingers,” “heart quickened”—avoiding diagnostic abstraction. However, her emotional progression lacks contradiction; she moves steadily toward epiphany without internal resistance or misstep, flattening the complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—"to learn the rhythm of belonging"—is consistent and embodied through her meticulous archival work and emotional response to discovery. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through action (e.g., solitary pursuit vs. shared awe with Kaelen). However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle; the "softly ingenious" trait feels more decorative than causally tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aelia’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile relationship with the crater glass, her “cheerful gloom,” and her micro-choices (e.g., feverishly arranging empty seeds) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to solve why memory paths vanish—is consistent and deepened by three cycles of obsession. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory action (“red bloomed like blood—fear”). Her final renunciation isn’t triumph but bittersweet endurance, credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s analytical nature and secret yearning for creative order are vividly embodied through tactile details (the bishop, breath curling like smoke) and micro-choices (placing the piece, watching the woman). His internal contradiction—craving chaos yet orchestrating it—is consistent and compelling. However, the woman remains underdeveloped beyond symbolic function, limiting relational depth. Her role serves Elias’s arc but lacks reciprocal pressure or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s motivation—transcending memory suppression through embodied cosmic inscription—is consistent, deeply rooted in her identity as a tide dancer, and intensifies toward a high-stakes transformation. Her internal conflict (exile vs. purpose, nostalgia vs. revelation) manifests simultaneously in her actions and perception, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of her old self is earned by months of disciplined observation and dance, with the cost being permanent exile from prior life and identity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through luminous veins, pulsing dust, and cellular transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glazier’s motivation—to illuminate value in the mundane—is consistent and poignant, but his interiority leans toward abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. His micro-choices (tossing the stone, reading ripples) reveal values yet lack tangible cost or struggle. The daughter’s memory feels evocative but unanchored in present action. Character reads as archetype more than individual, with minimal friction between desire and world.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his burn scars, trembling hands, and ritualistic handling of the bell reveal trauma without therapy-speak. His motivation (carrying the bell as penance) intensifies credibly into a reframing of purpose. The “bargain” feels psychologically authentic under duress, though the final epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“reframing his relationship to it”) rather than purely sensory realization. His gentle skill manifests in remembered actions, not just labels, satisfying the “hard softness” duality.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her “logical dreamer” lens, with contradictions embodied in her tactile engagement with patterns and the gauge. Her motivation—to derive equations for hope—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (adjusting shells, sea glass) that carry symbolic weight. However, emotional stakes remain abstract; the cost of failure is never viscerally felt, only conceptually implied. The absence of interpersonal pressure or tangible consequence limits the depth of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—to discover what walls dream about—is compellingly idiosyncratic and consistently embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., kneeling to retrieve the film, pressing his palm to the wall). His “sensitively perceptive” trait drives both curiosity and vulnerability, culminating in an earned renunciation: accepting legacy as direction, not burden. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory immersion (“felt its silent reverberations in his bones”). However, the epiphany that mapping wall-dreams is “mercy” leans slightly abstract without deeper contradiction or struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mirage painter’s interiority is vividly embodied—her borrowed heartbeat, stained fingers, and coded lullabies reveal a psyche shaped by trade-offs and quiet obsession. Her motivation (to capture liminal possibilities) emerges organically through action, not exposition. The fleeting thought of the musician shows layered empathy without sentimentality. Final renunciation—letting the mirage dissolve—is earned by her consistent ethos of transience.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied emotion and credible contradiction—his gentleness clashes with the weight of war’s consequences. His micro-choices (reading names aloud, setting down the clipboard) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, the epiphany “redemption was not a destination but a journey” leans toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization in the moment. The final shift feels earned but slightly abstracted at peak emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—amoral magnate vs. secretly sentimental preserver—is embodied in tactile detail (“gloved hands,” “blood rushing in his ears”) and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses redemption. His micro-choices (kneeling, initiating release) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: extinction preserved by its architect. However, the reflection on his childhood specimen slightly flattens immediacy without altering present tactics, nudging below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtesan’s interior conflict—between societal expectation and self-possession—is vividly embodied in her trembling fingers, poetic sway, and deliberate untangling. Her motivation intensifies credibly through pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses conformity with visible cost: the dissolution of echoes tied to regret. However, her epiphany edges toward diagnostic clarity (“true freedom was not in defying expectations, but in choosing which ones to keep”) without sufficient prior struggle to fully earn its articulation. The character remains compelling but slightly idealized in her resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—ethical storytelling—is embodied through concrete choices: reversing tales, embedding subtext in calligraphy, releasing puppets. His “uncommon serenity” masks internal tension, revealed subtly in micro-choices (e.g., carrying the stick in burlap). However, secondary characters (critic, bar patrons) lack depth or pressure; their function is thematic echo, not crucible. Interior contradiction is present but leans slightly toward intellectualized calm over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his identity as an “esoteric realist” manifests through embodied action, not exposition. His micro-choices (incorporating the fallen monarch, placing the moth wing) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reverence for transience. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“fingers tracing the ridge of a quartz vein”) and deliberate pacing. His renunciation of permanence is earned and carries conceptual cost: honoring loss without preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    The caster’s motivation—preserving forgotten names—is rooted in specific, embodied guilt and expressed through tactile actions (handling the rope, card). His “technically gentle” hands tremble yet act with precision, revealing internal contradiction without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of self-blame is earned by his ritual labor, and the cost—years of silence, brittle ancestral hair—is felt in every fiber he reconfigures. His transformation from creator to listener crystallizes credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “precisely playful” movements and dream-guided foresight reveal a mind both burdened and gifted. His motivation (“to discover why some paths choose their walkers”) evolves organically into earned self-acceptance, not epiphany. The final realization—that he was forged by necessity, not chosen—is rooted in prior action (nudging the panel, entering the AI’s dreamscape). No diagnostic label-speak; his contradiction (keeper/prisoner) drives every micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s frugality, empirical irony, and devotion manifest through precise micro-choices—arranging tools, pressing his palm—that reveal a hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction (scientist courting the unknown) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—leaving the tile—carries visible cost: exile from institutional recognition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in tactile reverence for numbers and stars.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s pacifist scheming evolves credibly into compassion, and his micro-choices (offering the music box repeatedly) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, secondary characters like Leo and Maya function more as thematic vessels than fully embodied individuals—their transformations feel emotionally resonant but lack contradictory impulses or idiosyncratic interiority. The cellular memory concept risks therapy-speak but is grounded through physical reactions (tears, trembling). Final renunciation—accepting imperfection as healing—is earned, though the cost to Elias remains abstract until the closing line.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—grounded in grief, craft, and quiet obsession—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (grinding glass, arranging shards). His internal contradiction between control and surrender manifests physically in his ritual. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; emotion lives in frost-shimmer, breath plumes, and calloused hands. Final renunciation (not trapping but housing the dream) is earned by his prior choices and carries the cost of permanent boundary erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mender’s interiority is vividly embodied—her quartz eye, stained fingers, and tactile rituals reveal grief without therapy-speak. Her motivation (to mend the breach through symbolic planting) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices: burying the ribbon, then the key and candle. The “endearingly feisty” daughter exists only in memory but shapes the mender’s actions credibly. However, the daughter’s absence limits relational pressure, and the final renunciation lacks a decisive cost beyond hope.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Margaret’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bewilderment, curiosity, and “brightened disquiet” evolve through tactile experiences (warm shell, crystalline fruit) rather than abstract musing. Her micro-choices (taking the cameo to restricted wing, documenting visits, writing the note) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on epistemic courage. The final renunciation—passing the inheritance without dread but “strange joy”—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: surrendering linear selfhood. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotional progression feels irrational yet coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is razor-sharp and embodied through precise scholarly action, not abstract longing. Her interiority—rooted in linguistic rigor and quiet desperation—is consistent and particular, especially in her handling of the diary and squid ink. The final renunciation (leaving without looking back) carries visible emotional cost, crystallizing her endurance as Earned Stasis. Kael’s transfixed sorrow reveals depth without over-explanation, and their dynamic functions as a crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chimera twin’s internal contradiction—between fractured identity and yearning for wholeness—is embodied through mismatched limbs, the chimera’s stirrings, and micro-choices like pressing the swatch card to the booth. Motivation is consistent and intensifies toward self-sacrifice. However, emotional states occasionally verge on diagnostic (“unkindled solace,” “fractured soul”) without sufficient bodily grounding in peak moments, slightly flattening authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—“to translate confusion into clarity”—is embodied in his tactile engagement with the seal and rope, not merely stated. His warmly methodical nature drives every micro-choice, from recognizing braid patterns to fusing the doors, with visible cost: he trades archival detachment for active stewardship of absence. The internal contradiction between archivist neutrality and fable-keeper urgency simmers without melodrama. His transformation feels earned because it emerges from consistent traits under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lorne’s motivation is clear and consistent—his search for silence amid chaos defines his actions and identity. His interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with ice, stone, and breath rather than abstract reflection. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; his resolve emerges through micro-choices (pressing the stone, ignoring the beings) under pressure. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, limiting full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—is compellingly rooted in his retrocognitive trauma and drives every action. His interiority is vivid (“thistle-blown hope,” “shard of hush”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. However, his emotional state remains largely uncontradicted; the absence of doubt or hesitation under immense pressure flattens his humanity slightly at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is consistent and interiority is richly rendered through tactile perception and poetic cognition. His “preemptively nostalgic” trait creates emotional texture but lacks a contradictory impulse that actively shapes choice under pressure. The final renunciation—enduring the loss of whispers—is credible but leans more on atmosphere than embodied struggle. Still, his identity as archivist feels lived-in, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlo’s interiority is vividly embodied—hopelessness isn’t named but shown through their drawn-out frown, deliberate chant, and tactile handling of the kerosene knot. Their motivation (defying despair through creation) intensifies credibly into action, culminating in a renunciation of passivity that forecloses stagnation with felt cost. The “serious playfulness” trait manifests in consistent micro-choices (e.g., wondering if combustion will smell sweet), revealing a hierarchy of values: beauty over safety, revelation over concealment. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotional progression feels lived-in, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile observation and metaphor, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Their “warmly observant” trait manifests in micro-choices—handling the cicada, tracing ripples—that reveal a hierarchy of values centered on liminal states. Mara’s unreadable expression and eventual softening credibly pressure Elian’s stance without head-hopping or status drift. The final Charged Poise crystallizes their relational shift with visible emotional cost: the unsaid words now shared, yet the transition remains unresolved, honoring Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—collecting silences—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with sensory specificity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through tactile rituals (fasting her ears, clutching the doll). The porcelain doll functions as both emotional anchor and silent interlocutor, deepening character without dialogue. However, the father remains a flat offstage presence, limiting relational crucible impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to teach silence how to comfort—is vividly embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, placing the vial) and consistent interiority. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding feeling in tactile detail (the vial’s temperature, the prisms’ hum). However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she acts with near-perfect clarity, reducing dramatic tension. The absence of struggle or blind spots prevents full 9+ eligibility despite strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in generational duty, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—his choices feel inevitable rather than fraught. The “wisely adventurous” trait is stated but not dramatized through competing desires under pressure. His emotional state remains abstract (“heart raced,” “fingers trembling”) without embodied contradiction or degradation under stress. Final renunciation (not claiming the throne) is thematically sound but feels preordained, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile relationship with the doorknocker ring, her surgical metaphor for severing ties, and her fear of emotional contagion reveal a character shaped by trauma yet capable of precise moral calculus. Her final choice—to reestablish connection—is earned through consistent motivation and prior causality. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through concrete sensation (“phantom pains,” “ash-thickened stone”). Her contradiction—desiring to heal suffocation while fearing being consumed—is active in-scene, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s motivation is vividly rooted in lived trauma, and his emotional arc—from burdened survivor to lightened agent—is credibly embodied through tactile choices (pressing the bolt into soil, clutching diamonds). Interiority avoids therapy-speak, favoring sensory metaphors (“ache in his chest,” “discordant memories”). However, Mara remains a cipher whose presence exerts pressure without reciprocal development, limiting relational depth. The final renunciation of past weight feels earned, though the transformation leans slightly toward epiphanic neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in lineage and erasure, with embodied gestures (tracing the sigil, gripping the crank) revealing interiority. His final renunciation—truth-bringer over dynasty ender—is earned by the ancestral vision and resonates with cost: the weight of inherited lies lifted only through confrontation. However, the great-grandfather’s appearance borders on deus ex machina, slightly undermining the self-driven arc. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. truth) act in scene but resolve cleanly without lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The knight’s motivation is vividly rendered but lacks interior contradiction; his transformation feels earned yet untested by genuine struggle or flawed choice. Emotion is embodied through tactile details (“armor clinking like a song”), but the absence of competing impulses flattens psychological depth. The murmured allegiance guides him without resistance, making his evolution feel more like revelation than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “tactfully hopeful” nature manifests in micro-choices like preserving the button with the drawing. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels; sorrow and hope coexist without tidy resolution. The final decision to archive the artifacts as a unit feels earned by his established reverence for marginalia. However, the lack of active resistance or risk beyond observation slightly limits the stakes of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent—her rebellion against historical erasure stems from a deeply personal commitment to truth. Her interiority is concrete (“trembling hands,” “carefully noting puddles”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The story shows her resourcefulness and emotional restraint under pressure, though her internal conflict remains slightly muted; we see determination more than contradiction. Her final act of endurance (slipping away after broadcasting Marcus) earns Charged Poise with visible cost: isolation, risk, and the burden of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in a burden of memory and silence, with his internal conflict embodied through precise musical choices. His micro-decisions—strategic silences, weighted notes—reveal a hierarchy of values (preserving collective memory over personal peace) with visible cost: aging, isolation, daily vigilance. The reflection on the dead composer is concretely anchored to dewdrops and glass, tilting his present resolve without flattening pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“fingers hovering,” “dewdrops dripped onto his forehead”).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—decoding lost memory through seeds and leaves—is rooted in consistent, embodied ritual, and his transformation into a keeper feels earned. His interiority is vividly rendered through tactile detail (tweezers from fallen stars, arranging ash-colored fronds), avoiding diagnostic labels. The story sidesteps emotional summarization by grounding awe and purpose in physical acts: prodding dust, watching monuments pulse. However, the epiphany arrives with near-instantaneous acceptance, slightly flattening the cost of his new role.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tinkerer’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “uncertainly certain” mindset manifests in micro-choices like trusting the erratic compass and abandoning his broken clock. His flaws (fixation on order, emotional paralysis) directly shape his arc without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—accepting brokenness as mending—is earned through tactile struggle, not epiphany. His contradiction (mender who cannot fix himself) drives every action with consistent, character-specific logic.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tremor, his precise attention to Lyra’s smile, the weight of regret in his hands—and his flaws (perfectionism, emotional blindness) directly cause the fracture he now seeks to mend. His micro-choice to fuse gold into the coin’s chip, not to restore but to honor breakage, reveals a hierarchy of values earned through prior failure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile alchemical labor, not therapy-speak. Final renunciation—accepting imbalance as balance—is credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The collector’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “luminous ache,” tactile connection to the crocodile’s tooth, and micro-choices (kneeling, adjusting melody) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. His motivation—to integrate laughter into healing—is dramatized through action, not declared. However, his emotional arc lacks genuine contradiction; he moves seamlessly from encounter to encounter without internal resistance or misstep, flattening struggle. The child and woman function as spectral mirrors rather than crucibles, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—seeking the “mathematics of mercy”—is compellingly rooted in trauma, and his proprioceptive enhancement creates a visceral, embodied interiority. His contradictory impulses (endurance vs. collapse, memory vs. presence) act simultaneously during the forest epiphany. The final choice—to move forward armed with an equation—is earned by prior causality, with the phantom mask pressure receding as tangible cost. However, the leap to a symbolic integral formula risks tipping into diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining emotional authenticity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The translator’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories—is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in childhood intuition and crystallized through tactile engagement with the fragment. Her interiority is embodied (“fingers tracing,” “fragment grew warmer”) rather than abstract, and her final choice to write is earned by prior causality. The lone flaw: minimal internal contradiction; her resolve borders on unwavering, reducing emotional complexity. Still, micro-choices (approaching the stall, leaning in) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: time, solitude, legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The technician’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his “skillfully observant” nature drives precise, tactile actions. His emotional burden (“weightless in its familiarity”) avoids therapy-speak and manifests through economical gestures. The final choice to pocket the mainspring barrel feels earned by his established method and worldview. However, interior contradiction remains subtle rather than simultaneous, slightly limiting psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is compellingly rooted in his identity as a man of order confronting chaos, and his final leap is earned through escalating destabilization. His internal conflict between control and surrender manifests physically (ink-stained hands, clean hands) and through micro-choices (wandering aisles, pocketing the bottle). The transformation from operator to “just a man” carries conceptual cost: loss of purpose, identity, and sanctuary. However, the emotional progression leans slightly abstract near the climax (“felt himself unravel”) rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in embodied sorrow and poetic sensibility, not abstract idealism. His micro-choices—veiling mirrors, smuggling the shard—reveal a hierarchy of values that privileges emotional truth over institutional authority. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; his revolutionary past manifests through tactile memory (“hands that still remembered the shape of a protest sign”). The final renunciation—keeping memory private rather than arguing with curators—is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in generational craft and metaphysical duty, with micro-choices (e.g., removing a “perfect” gear) revealing his hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile memory and sensory detail (“fingers stained with oil and age”). The cost of his devotion—personal isolation, the weight of town-wide survival—is felt without being overstated. His final smile carries earned stasis: quiet triumph after immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—“to find the place where explanations fail”—is embodied in every choice, from abandoning his petrichor vials to dissolving into memory at the lagoon. His interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, awe and obsession manifest through tactile perception (“calloused thumb,” “blood thrumming in his ears”). The final renunciation of the compass is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he ceases to be a collector, becoming a witness. His eccentricity isn’t decorative—it enables the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s “perpetually learning” trait is embodied in tactile, specific actions—her hands tracing grain, reimagining driftwood—and culminates in a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) that forecloses aimless wandering with visible cost: the storm, isolation, and prior uncertainty. Her internal contradiction—between chaos and scaffolding—is active in-scene, not summarized. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from disorientation to serene purpose lacks friction or irrationality that would deepen authenticity under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and particular, especially in her embodied obsession with nocturnal flora and the tactile handling of postcards. Her motivation—rooted in quiet curiosity rather than external validation—is consistent and intensifies credibly across seasons. The final renunciation isn’t of desire but of solitude, replaced by shared revelation; this Earned Stasis carries subtle cost (her private quest becomes public legacy). However, the lack of on-page resistance or missteps softens the struggle, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—uncovering silenced histories—is vividly rooted in his role as a civil-rights archivist and intensifies credibly through embodied choices (kneeling, arranging debris). His internal conflict between duty and dread manifests in precise micro-actions, not abstract summaries. The final renunciation (“REMEMBER”) carries visible cost: the diary’s ink bleeding like penance, truth tattooed on his ribs. One flaw: the activist’s backstory slightly overshadows Elias’s own emotional arc at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in his rejection of false comfort, driving every creative decision. His internal conflict—balancing art and sustenance, democracy and wisdom—is embodied through micro-choices that carry visible cost. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction; the transition from hesitation to resolution feels swift. Still, his flaws and limits shape credible struggle, avoiding safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—archiving emotional patterns through dead languages—is vividly embodied and drives his climactic choice to immerse himself in the prophecy. His internal contradiction (preservation vs. transformation) resolves credibly through instinct rather than calculation, with felt cost: loss of former identity. The third-grade memory functions as a micro-choice catalyst, not mere exposition. However, the transition from scribe to vessel leans slightly on conceptual elegance over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—"furiously tranquil," "heat of purpose"—and her micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the cap, stepping through) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: sacrificing frantic urgency for serene balance. Her motivation stems from lineage and duty, intensified by the vortex inheritance’s burden. However, the emotional contradiction lacks full simultaneity; she transitions cleanly from tension to resolution without visible struggle mid-crisis, slightly undercutting the “frantic archivist” premise.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—protecting remote communities through a blend of ancient and modern methods—is consistent and embodied in precise actions (e.g., switching systems, tugging the bell rope). His “credibly curious” trait drives tangible choices with stakes, though interior contradiction is subtle rather than layered. The final renunciation of reliance on tech alone feels earned, but emotional complexity remains restrained, avoiding over-articulation while sacrificing some depth.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with her spiritual curiosity driving meaningful micro-choices—especially her nightly ritual with the lantern glass. Her transformation from isolated custodian to empathic conduit feels earned through embodied practice rather than abstract epiphany. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward acceptance without resistance or backsliding. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible but doesn’t undermine her solitary arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elisha’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his astonishment, solitude, and perceptiveness shape every choice. His micro-choices (approaching the box, interpreting patterns, performing the ritual) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preservation through silence. The final renunciation of broader human contact in favor of ghostly equilibrium feels earned, with cost legible in his continued isolation. However, internal contradiction remains muted; his tranquility borders on untested certainty, slightly flattening emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand the texture of time passing—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving his actions from sorting trinkets to decoding clues. His borrowed-time condition hums beneath the surface as a credible pressure, not a gimmick. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; the shift from fear to comfort feels earned but lacks friction. The absence of secondary characters limits relational crucible, but interiority remains specific and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—fingers coaxing secrets from barbs, the “warmly attentive” touch—and their motivation (“beauty in the incomplete”) directly fuels action. The final renunciation (leaving the sculpture to the tide) is earned through consistent behavior and carries conceptual cost: acceptance of impermanence as integral to meaning. However, the character remains slightly archetypal; their contradictions are implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—fostering interspecies respect before death—is deeply rooted in his identity as caretaker and crystallizes under terminal pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied through precise actions (e.g., trembling hands, deliberate wire-wrapping). Contradictory impulses (urgency vs. calm) coexist without resolution, culminating in Earned Stasis: he accepts death having nurtured relationships, not uncovered secrets. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost—his fraying consciousness contrasted against the orchard’s humming vitality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied doubt and tactile observation, especially in his handling of the fly amber. His academic skepticism feels consistent and particular, not generic. The transformation from luminous skeptic to reluctant believer is earned via concrete micro-choices—most pivotally, placing the amber on the pedestal. However, his emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coachman’s motivation is vividly rooted in ecological grief and spiritual duty, embodied through tactile actions (scattering seeds, listening to bird calls). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through ritual precision versus the enormity of loss. However, his emotional arc lacks a micro-choice under pressure—his actions feel ordained rather than wrestled with, slightly flattening agency. The final vigil shows endurance but not a renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—translating distance into closeness—is compelling and consistent, rooted in his sister’s disappearance. His interiority is vividly embodied through tactile interactions with the wax leaf and phonograph, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, his intuitively descriptive trait borders on unexamined competence; while it enables decoding, the story doesn’t dramatize its limits or costs mid-crisis. The final choice feels earned, but a sharper contradiction between hope and futility would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his grief, guilt, and quiet defiance coexist without resolution. His micro-choices (tracing the compass, shifting from memory to discovery) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act of sketching the ghost sky feels earned by his established ritual and trauma. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in charcoal strokes and breath held tight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—chivalry versus theft, loyalty versus rebellion—are embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., brushing the king yet swapping pieces) and intensify credibly under pressure. His motivation (“embrace the unknown”) emerges from lived history with the Architect, not abstraction, and his final renunciation of apprenticeship carries tangible emotional cost. The Architect’s presence deepens Kaelen’s internal conflict without flattening either character into archetype. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally leans on lyrical phrasing over visceral sensation during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trauma, profession, and mission intertwine without therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (actor vs. survivor) act simultaneously, especially when kneeling at the pawnless board. Her micro-choices (walking words in dust, documenting gestures) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: bearing memory instead of performing it. However, the final renunciation lacks a decisive on-page tradeoff that forecloses a concrete path—cost remains conceptual rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The seer’s motivation—escaping unbearable memories by seeding alternate realities—is deeply rooted in embodied pain (“chest tightening”) and consistent throughout. Her internal conflict between longing for home and fear of memory manifests in concrete micro-choices: seeking the stone, touching feather and obsidian simultaneously, choosing to seed a memory landscape. Emotions avoid diagnostic labels and remain sensory (“electric pulse,” “hidden thunder”). The final choice—to possibly never return—feels earned by prior causality and carries the cost of abandoning this world.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tutor’s guilt, fidgeting habit, and strategic mind cohere into a vivid interiority; his final move is earned through embodied struggle rather than epiphany. Contradictory impulses—self-punishment versus redemption—act simultaneously in scene, especially when he studies the stalemate board. His emotional progression avoids therapy-speak, using chess logic as authentic metaphor. The flaw—arrogance that ruined lives—is confronted with tangible cost: years of exile and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elaran’s contradictory impulses—defiant curiosity versus communal responsibility—are embodied in his actions and poetic reframing, not just stated. His “innocently mischievous” nature drives tangible choices (climbing towers, weakening seals) with escalating cost. The final descent shows earned endurance: he accepts consequences without retreat. However, interiority occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“terrible gravity”) rather than visceral sensation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s interiority is vividly embodied—his uncertainty, tactile rituals, and breath-holding under pressure feel specific and lived-in. His motivation intensifies credibly as the workshop tilts and acid threatens, compelling higher-stakes narration. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of perfectionism, earned through prior micro-choices like clutching the charm or continuing underwater. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through kintsugi light, trembling stools, and acidic submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The painter’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, intimate aloofness, and decades-long promise feel lived-in. His contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release memory) culminate in a credible, earned renunciation with tangible cost: the loss of the painted shell, symbolizing his relinquished grip on the past. The final micro-choice—lowering the shell into the tide pool—is motivated by prior causality and reconfigures his relationship to time and self. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in his quiet resolve after the heat wave. His interiority is concrete (“screaming tenderness,” “fragile egg he carried in his mind”) and embodied through tactile interactions with the lighthouse and cork. The final act—releasing the cork not by force but by purified intent—reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over control, silence over spectacle. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward abstraction in its climax, softening the visceral cost of his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The navigator’s grief is embodied through tactile memory (patches, censer foot) and micro-choices (not answering the phone, sketching the map), avoiding diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses—longing to return vs. accepting loss—act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation (“walk on his own”) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fading map and aching joints. Flaws like reliance on ritual feel human, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness and rationality clash compellingly under storm-induced stress, yielding embodied contradictions—e.g., her instinctual foraging versus her terror of mental exposure. Her micro-choice to share the glass eye emerges credibly from prior desperation and mutual recognition. The stranger’s empathic flinch creates a crucible that forces Elara’s renunciation of secrecy, foreclosing isolation with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hemlock’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling hands, the weight of borrowed memories, and his ritualistic preservation of lost moments reveal a deeply specific psyche. His motivation (to decode the stranger’s gesture) arises organically from his established gift and history, intensifying into meaningful action. The final choice—to leave Edelweiss nightly—is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost: he assumes stewardship of a grief not his own. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile engagement with maps and the chip, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His contradiction—keeper of others’ stories yet unable to author his own—is embodied in gesture and choice. The final act of drawing a new line feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost in years of silence. Clara’s absence functions as off-page pressure that crystallizes his loneliness into agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The queen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“eyes shadowed by the weight of a crown”) and contradictory impulses—duty versus memory, human fragility versus celestial power. Her final choice feels earned because it emerges from accumulated dream-logic and sensory triggers (fireflies, bleeding starlight), not sudden revelation. The seneschal’s loyalty deepens stakes without overshadowing her agency. However, the transition from human monarch to celestial guardian leans slightly on unearned epiphany rather than granular micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s scientifically romantic interiority is vividly embodied, especially in her tactile handling of the columella and pocket-sun. Her motivation—to capture “the density of presence”—drives concrete actions and micro-choices under pressure. However, Kael remains underdeveloped; his whispered secret catalyzes but doesn’t crucible their relationship, limiting relational stakes. The final choice feels earned, yet the cost (emotional or otherwise) is implied rather than viscerally shown.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied and contradictory: he envies his past self while scorning that envy, writes to impose order yet embraces temporal chaos. His micro-choices—dipping the quill, stepping into the night—are charged with the cost of foreclosed futures. The final smile feels earned, not epiphanic, arising from accumulated struggle rather than diagnostic self-awareness. No therapy-speak or stock phrasing mars his emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between numbness and the yearning to reconnect with her grandmother’s legacy—is rendered through embodied, sensory-deprived perception rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (tracing the screw, using the loupe, returning to clock repair) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in tactile memory. The trembling hands motif evolves credibly from symptom to symbol of transformation. Final agency emerges not as epiphany but as earned stasis: she resumes work, now grounded in inherited resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aeris’s motivation—to transform emotional scars into legible stories—is embodied through crystallization, a flaw that becomes both wound and medium. His interior contradiction (scholarly logic vs. childlike superstition) drives micro-choices under pressure, notably clutching the quill as “captured darkness.” The transformation is earned: his final act of writing a childish prayer reconfigures grief without erasing it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests physically (crystallized tears, stiff joints), aligning perfectly with his rune-scholar identity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eloise’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, guilt, and resolve manifest through precise physical actions (climbing the ladder, steady hands) and sensory perception (“gravel and starlight” voice). Her contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, shame vs. longing) operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The apology to Alistair feels earned by decades of avoidance, and her final micro-choice—to return the bottle as a “quiet monument”—carries visible emotional cost. Flaws are genuine: her past silence and his cowardice aren’t sanitized.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is vividly rendered but remains abstract; his internal conflict lacks concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. While the "end of history witness" carries thematic weight, his choices feel predetermined by concept rather than emerging from personal stakes. The sacrifice of “certainty itself” is intellectually compelling but emotionally distant—no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. His arc leans on label-speak (“wanderingly exact,” “spiral arbitration”) without dramatizing how those traits manifest under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete, character-specific perception—his dialogue with clocks, counting ritual, and tactile engagement with instruments reveal a mind both precise and poetic. His motivation (“to understand what clocks really measure”) evolves from curiosity to epiphany without sentimentality. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of illusion, foreclosing the path of naive measurement with conceptual cost. His “eminently peculiar” trait enables his insight, not merely labels it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias and the woman are vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—Elias’s spatial mapping, her hovering thumb—yet their motivations verge on abstract idealism. The “physics of letting go” risks becoming diagnostic label-speak, though it’s partially redeemed by tactile interactions (brushing fingers, laser use). Their convergence feels emotionally coherent but leans slightly tidy given the story’s thematic ambition. Interior contradiction is present but muted under the lyrical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—her compulsive gambling vs. desire to heal her father, logic vs. poetry—and her micro-choices (collecting scrawls, bringing the lantern) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. The father’s softening feels earned, not sentimental, though his shift leans slightly toward convenience. Her guilt and hope are woven without therapy-speak. The final exchange lands with credible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Archie’s interiority is richly embodied—his estrangement, ritualized duty, and quiet yearning emerge through tactile interactions with the disc and callers. His motivation (“to teach endings how to begin”) arises organically from inherited trauma and reciprocal need, not exposition. The micro-choice to trace the disc during difficult calls reveals a hierarchy of values: connection over isolation, guidance over escape. His final realization—that his solitude was never true solitude but calibrated distance—feels earned, with the cost of perpetual liminality legible in every loop.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his walnut-stained fingers, tactile locket ritual, and haunted euphoria feel character-specific. His motivation (preserving small moments to honor Melina and the covenant) intensifies credibly toward his final renunciation. The choice to surrender the locket feels earned by decades of proximate-cause documentation, with visible emotional cost. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; his acceptance arrives smoothly without palpable struggle against hope or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orion’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “desperately jocular mask,” fraying pack, and vacuum-like loneliness feel specific and lived-in. His contradictory impulses (seeking connection yet vanishing before gratitude) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The moon rock exchange reveals his flawed belief in transactional salvation, making his final shift to listening earned. However, the epiphany leans slightly close to diagnostic clarity (“loneliness wasn’t a disease…”) without enough struggle in the moment to fully avoid therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—navigating emotional depths to quiet his inner storm—is deeply embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., stepping toward C minor, kneeling at B flat). His blindness isn’t a trope but a lens that shapes how he interprets the world, with contradictions in desire (selfish yet sacred) rendered without therapy-speak. The final smile feels earned, not epiphanic, arising from sensory surrender rather than cognitive insight. No secondary characters dilute focus; interiority remains concrete and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    The interpreter’s interiority is richly embodied—contradictory impulses (“confidently uncertain,” love for the garden of doubt) drive micro-choices like unbending the nib and rewriting the rewrite. Their flaw (over-editing history) compounds before resolution, and their renunciation of perfection carries visible emotional cost. The final endurance (“always editing, always learning”) reads as Earned Stasis with thematic weight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile interaction with pen and anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Julian and Lyra’s motivations are rooted in shared grief and purpose, conveyed through embodied gestures and micro-choices (e.g., interlocking hands, the empty camera). Their relationship functions as a crucible—Lyra’s signing isn’t just communication but co-creation under pressure. However, interior contradiction is muted; their emotional states align too seamlessly, lacking friction or divergent impulses that would deepen authenticity. The final renunciation (“pockets empty of film but full of songs”) is earned, yet the cost feels aesthetic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “volcanic tenderness,” charcoal-stained hands, and oscillation between rage and reverence feel authentic and specific. Her motivation (the forgotten promise) roots her actions in personal history without over-explaining. The final choice—to burn the treaty scroll as absolution—is earned by her arc from destruction to restoration. However, the transition from vandal to restorer leans slightly on symbolic assertion rather than granular psychological causality in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his drumming, pulse, and tears convey layered emotion without diagnostic labels. His motivation (preserving entangled memories) intensifies credibly into defiance and tenderness. The rebellion feels earned through micro-choices: quickening then gentling his drumming as stakes evolve. However, his resilience as a “guinea pig” is asserted more than dramatized in early beats, slightly softening the causal foundation of his endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—proving his acoustic theory—is consistent and rooted in professional pride, deepened by his inherited obsession with folded maps. His micro-choices (whispering, using the coin, revealing the key) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over possession. Jenna’s presence sharpens the crucible; her shift from scoffing to awe feels earned. However, her interiority remains thin, limiting full relationship reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian’s motivation and emotional restraint feel deeply rooted in his role, with micro-choices (shutter adjustments, mirror use) revealing a hierarchy of values. Anna’s grief is embodied through posture and unsent letters, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her internal shift leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction—her hesitation resolves cleanly rather than wrestling with doubt. The guardian’s “spiralingly calm” trait borders on static, lacking visible tradeoffs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arthur’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied contradictions—his gift isolates yet fuels connection, his rebellion is quiet yet precise. His micro-choices (e.g., cradling fragile ideas, positioning mirrors) reveal a hierarchy of values: nurturing doubt over certainty. The unspoken-word trait enables authentic emotional texture without therapy-speak. However, secondary characters remain lightly sketched, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “guarded cage” and “tender ferocity” feel earned, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (clutching the scrimshaw, pulling the charm) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: detachment from her old life. The shift from performance to authenticity is credible because it emerges through tactile action, not epiphany. However, the final emotional state (“combative tenderness”) borders on label-speak without sufficient contradictory behavior to ground it mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through precise gestures (whittling, palming the carving) and contradictory impulses—performing compliance while nurturing rebellion. Their motivation stems from grief transformed into resistance, not therapy-speak. The final whisper breaks their blankness with earned emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; moral ambiguity is lived, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—driven by aesthetic obsession and the desire to dissolve boundaries—is consistent and intensifies credibly toward dissolution. His interiority is poetic yet embodied (“tremor of certainty in his bones,” “palms against the pillar”), avoiding diagnostic abstraction. However, his transformation lacks visible internal contradiction; the shift from observer to boundary-master feels seamless rather than wrestled. The cost of his old self “sloughing away” is implied but not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling desire to perceive beauty beyond monochrome, with his “innocently cunning” trait embodied through plant-based communication rather than stated. His internal conflict—longing for color while accepting his gray world—is dramatized in micro-choices (e.g., selecting the white lily). The flaw of never having seen color drives credible behavior without safety-hedging. However, Lyra remains slightly underdeveloped as a pressure source; her silent understanding feels convenient rather than earned through reciprocal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bell ringer’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—pressing the lens to light, stepping into the halo—but their motivation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene. The epiphany about connection feels earned by action, yet emotional complexity leans toward lyrical resolution over internal friction. No secondary characters dilute focus, preserving single-POV coherence. The “powerfully gentle” trait shapes behavior but isn’t tested against opposing drives.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s grief is embodied through tactile details—silver-stained fingers, vellum stencils, hollow pendants—and his transformation from mourner to mentor feels earned. His internal contradiction (desire to memorialize vs. need to transform loss) manifests in concrete choices: shifting jewelry design, leaving origami coordinates. The backstory of his daughter’s death anchors present action without overwhelming it, and his micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values—hope over despair—with visible cost: he never leaves the observatory, tethered to purpose. No therapy-speak; emotions emerge through craft and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile detail (onyx-stained fingers, brass tape) and a coherent hierarchy of values—curiosity over safety, pattern over profit. Her micro-choices (confiding in Chen, drawing The Star) reveal earned conviction. However, her emotional state remains slightly abstracted; the “steadily curious” trait borders on label-speak without deeper contradiction under pressure. No diagnostic self-awareness, but the lack of internal friction weakens the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a lifelong pursuit of forbidden knowledge, and her internal conflict—anguished joy—is embodied through visceral reactions. However, her emotional progression leans on abstract labels like “end of innocence” without sufficient micro-choices that reveal shifting priorities under pressure. The final renunciation of predictability feels conceptually earned but lacks a concrete, dramatized moment where she sacrifices a tangible alternative. Her transformation is asserted more than shown in decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “luminous regret” and tactile engagement with the river stone reveal a psyche shaped by observation and loss. Her motivation (preserving hope’s shape) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: activating the stone, reconfiguring the library. However, her metamorphosis lacks a visible struggle or blind spot; competence dominates without friction. The final renunciation of perfect restoration feels earned but slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maria’s interior conflict—between self-respect and compassion—is embodied through tactile, profession-specific actions (tracing measurements, handling the tail tip) rather than abstract introspection. Her micro-choices (e.g., refusing to ignore the con) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Eleanor functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting focus. However, the final renunciation lacks a tangible sacrifice beyond emotional labor, slightly softening the earnedness of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile engagement with coffee rings, scars, and plants reveals a mind in crisis without resorting to diagnostic labels. Her motivation (reading scars, not erasing them) emerges through concrete choices: apologizing to Samuel, reinterpreting her practice. The flaw lies in slight over-articulation during peak realization (“translator, not an editor”), which edges toward therapy-speak but is redeemed by immediate action. Final renunciation of erasure feels earned, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal gazer’s motivation—locating “unused love”—is deeply personal, consistent, and embodied through tactile interaction with the film strip. His spatial imagination isn’t just stated; it actively shapes his perception and quest. The emotional burden of unexpressed affection feels urgent and human, not abstract. His final realization reframes that burden as contribution, a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) with resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between stifled creativity and cosmic urging—is rendered with embodied specificity (trembling fingers, stardust on hands) and contradictory impulses that coexist in scene. Her micro-choices (aligning the astrolabe repeatedly despite exhaustion) reveal a hierarchy of values: surrender to inspiration over self-doubt. The “cursed gift” of hearing unspoken words deepens her isolation without veering into diagnostic label-speak. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than earned causality, softening the cost of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The freight guard’s dreamless mind is a compelling flaw that actively shapes his role and choices, not just a trait. His motivation—to cultivate sparks in unlit corners—is embodied through precise actions (extracting the seedling, whispering to it) rather than stated abstraction. Internal contradiction emerges subtly: he navigates divergent histories yet remains anchored in present need, resisting indulgence. The final renunciation of personal dreams for collective restoration feels earned, with cost legible in his persistent emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied perception (“hum vibrated through Elian's bones”) and micro-choices (placing the gear at the convergence) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The character avoids diagnostic self-awareness, instead expressing philosophical inquiry through tactile engagement. However, the final epiphany leans slightly toward unearned articulation (“recognize how uniquely it resonated”), bordering on label-speak without sufficient struggle preceding it. Still, motivation intensifies credibly from refuge-seeking to active unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The traveler’s transformation is evocative but lacks concrete interior contradiction or embodied struggle; motivation hinges on abstract “unused courage” without tangible friction or flawed resistance. Elara and Marek serve as archetypal guides rather than individuated characters—their dialogue conveys theme more than personality. The traveler’s final choice feels earned thematically but not causally rooted in specific prior behavior or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bellhop’s interiority is concrete and particular—his sharpened hearing, trembling hands, and "cold, quiet fire" embody his emotional state without diagnostic labels. His motivation ("to understand the cost of safety") intensifies credibly into a renunciation: he chooses silent endurance over escape, foreclosing personal safety to honor the vanished. The final choice is earned through prior causality (discovering the ledger) and carries visible cost (accepting nerve regeneration). No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; the single-POV execution is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s regal restraint and patient resolve are embodied through micro-choices—dissolving ink, writing runes—not summary. His motivation is consistent, rooted in lineage and truth, yet his diminutive form contrasts powerfully with his mythic role. The pretender’s collapse reveals Kael’s moral clarity without sentimentality. However, the interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene under peak pressure, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—discovering why paths disappear—is compellingly rooted in personal history and environmental grief, not abstraction. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied through tactile actions (tapping rhythms, handling the atlas). The final choice to walk anew feels earned by his micro-choices throughout, especially aligning console taps with tide rhythms. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bare feet, trembling confidence, and tactile engagement with the stone circle reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (kneeling, placing palms) stem from consistent traits and escalate meaningfully. The final shift from scanning outward to inward feels earned, not epiphanic. No secondary characters dilute focus; her solitude sharpens agency.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maeva’s motivation—to evolve tradition with intent—is vividly embodied through her secret studies, telepathic connection to plants, and decisive unsealing of the amber. Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (reverence vs. rebellion) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: breaking generational determinism. However, her emotional arc lacks a micro-choice under immediate physical pressure that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her trauma manifests through somatic freezes, henna-trained hands now tending plants, and micro-choices like framing the photograph. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. nurturing) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Her quietly talented trait enables meaningful action with visible cost: she cultivates life amid devastation without erasing loss. The final renunciation of hiding Rafe’s photo feels earned by prior causality and consistent emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The artist’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt-sticky wood, luminescent ache—and his shift from despair to resolve feels earned through tactile engagement with the tarot box and cards. However, his transformation leans slightly on abstract epiphanies (“fractures are where the light gets in”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction under pressure. His micro-choices (mending the box, gathering cards) reveal a hierarchy of values, yet the emotional pivot lacks a moment of genuine resistance or cost beyond mood shift. Still, his arc coheres with the story’s accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand time’s elasticity in crisis—is consistent, embodied, and drives every action. His “serene anger” and “consciously wild” nature manifest through micro-choices (e.g., uncorking the vial with practiced hands, not flinching at the drone’s alarm). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are tactile (“anger simmering beneath the surface—not hot or loud, but serene”). The final renunciation of chasing permanence is earned by his lifelong obsession and culminates in a quiet acceptance that forecloses his old desperation with visible cost: peace replaces pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but her interiority relies on repetitive labels like “bravely conflicted” without embodied contradiction in-scene. Emotions are stated rather than shown through specific, character-particular perception under stress. The final choice feels thematically inevitable but lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile relationship with the sandbag scrap, the velvet-wrapped knife, and her whispered plant rituals reveal a coherent moral stance shaped by trauma. Her pacifism isn’t abstract but enacted through daily micro-choices that foreclose violence. The father-daughter dynamic remains off-page yet emotionally legible through objects and memory. However, her “senselessly perceptive” trait borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient irrational contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fisher’s cool-headedness and emotional transliteration are embodied through precise, contradictory actions—his calm exterior versus raw soul-pouring—and his final renunciation carries visible cost. His motivation is consistent, deepened by loneliness, and culminates in a choice that forecloses further hunting. The rail spike anchors his internal state without diagnostic label-speak. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in “profound longing” near climax, but immediately grounded by physical ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “devotedly observant” trait drives micro-choices (searching the desk, interpreting the nib) with embodied cost. Her motivation intensifies credibly from grief to investigative resolve, rooted in familial loyalty and journalistic inheritance. The bent nib and star chart function as tactile catalysts that align with her character logic. However, her emotional shift lacks a visible struggle or contradictory impulse in-scene, slightly softening the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Orion’s guilt over his daughter’s death is embodied through tactile rituals (tattooing, handling amber) and micro-choices (writing the unread letter, selecting Lacerta), not therapy-speak. His contradictory impulses—preserving cries vs. silencing guilt—clash in scene, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses his self-punishment with visible cost: trembling hands stilled only after resolution. The backstory is anchored to present stimuli (amber resonance → memory) and alters his action (preparing the tattoo). No diagnostic labels; emotion lives in ink, firmware static, and whiskey-burn metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her whimsical artistry and social perception, driving concrete choices like pocketing the tile flake and constructing the mandala. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing emotion through embodied detail (“fingers trembling,” “breath that tasted of lilac and courage”). The final act—pressing her palm into the sand—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she doesn’t reverse the unlearning but reinterprets it. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her resolve intensifies without meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle yet unyielding, haunted yet purposeful—is rendered through embodied choices (pressing the tessera into her palm, renaming the lion) rather than diagnostic labels. Her retrocognitive trap feels visceral, not expositional, and her motivation (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is dramatized through action, not assertion. The final micro-choice—to kneel again and whisper another name—earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost. No therapy-speak or epiphanies; her struggle remains authentically unresolved yet forward-moving.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arthur’s encore-seeking nature and synesthetic perception are embodied with vivid specificity, driving micro-choices (e.g., tasting notes, clutching the coin) that reveal layered interiority. His motivation—luring possibility from despair—is dramatized through action, not summary, and his transformation into a guardian feels earned by decades of repetition. The cost is felt in his relinquishment of personal applause for communal legacy. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars his emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her somatic markers, skepticism, and artistic drive cohere into a specific, contradictory psychology. Her motivation (“illuminate hidden pathways”) intensifies organically into action, and her final stance (cartographer, not victim) feels earned through physicalized struggle. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in “willowglass hope” and “beautiful, terrible architecture,” which edge toward diagnostic lyricism rather than raw perception.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a sensory map maker, and her internal conflict—between silence and the need to translate it—drives credible choices. Her embodied perception (tingling skin, heat-mapping) avoids diagnostic label-speak, though the transition from observer to “conduit” leans slightly toward unearned epiphany. The fossil’s warmth acts as both external catalyst and internal mirror, aligning action with motive. Final clarity feels earned, but the emotional shift at the climax lacks a tangible cost beyond abstract revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—unscrambling fate through buttons—and her interiority is concrete, especially in tactile interactions with objects. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice feels earned, but the internal struggle lacks layered irrationality or hypocrisy that would push this into the 9+ range. Her quiet inspiration remains a label more than a tested trait with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s prudently daring nature is embodied through micro-choices—kneeling to open the pillbox, crafting a snow cipher—that reveal his hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal conflict (daring vs. caution, penance vs. survival) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—vouchsafing Althea’s future—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“phantom of warmth in the biting air”).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile connection to the yarn needle, his ambient listening, and his emotional restraint feel character-specific. His motivation (the palimpsest promise) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices: waiting, closing his eyes, rising when the fog lifts. The final renunciation of the past is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost (months of vigil, emotional isolation). However, the brother-figure’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient friction or contradiction in the coachman’s response, slightly softening the climax’s emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s phototropic sensitivity to kindness is embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices—thumb tracing worn glass, standing as “a sunbeam in a small, dark room”—not abstract labels. His quiet endurance forecloses intervention (he doesn’t repair), accepting the cost of witnessing without altering. Interior contradiction pulses beneath calm: desire to understand warring with respect for preserved pain. Final renunciation feels earned by his potter’s ethos (“a kiln-fire scar is part of a pot's story”).

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gardener’s motivation—rooted in communal care and spiritual pragmatism—is consistent and compelling. His internal conflict between vulnerability and purpose manifests through precise, embodied actions (e.g., secretive mirror installation). However, his emotional arc lacks a visible contradiction in-scene; impulses alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The final renunciation of recognition is credible but slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradiction—her isolation versus yearning for connection, fragility versus resilience—but her epiphany (“independence didn’t mean alone-ness”) edges close to diagnostic label-speak without sufficient micro-choice buildup. Her transformation feels earned emotionally but lacks a concrete, irreversible decision that forecloses an option with visible cost. The reflective passages are vivid yet slightly abstracted from immediate pressure. Still, her voice and emotional texture remain consistent and deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete sensory perception and metaphor, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. His motivation—to find the thread connecting human longing—is consistent and deepens organically. The final reconfiguration feels earned because his epiphany arises from embodied interaction with the nest and sculpture, not imposed insight. However, the “inevitably whimsical” trait remains underutilized as a causal force, slightly weakening character-specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she acts from scientific integrity and concern for societal fracture—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. Emotions remain summarized (“cautiously hopeful,” “increasingly isolated”) rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (sabotaging signals alone) carries cost, yet her competence borders on frictionless, weakening struggle. A stronger showing of doubt or error would elevate this to 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The explorer’s claustrophobia and "prudently adventurous" nature generate authentic internal conflict, embodied in trembling hands and breath control rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—pressing the compass despite panic, resisting flight instinct—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over earned endurance; the shift from fear to “wistful rebellion” lacks a decisive renunciation or irreversible sacrifice that would fully satisfy Earned Stasis under this length’s constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the engine of his method and motivation, grounding his interiority in sensory fragments rather than faces. His micro-choices—kneeling, using tweezers, sketching absence—are precise, embodied, and consistent with his condition. The final act of leaving the portrait is a renunciation charged with quiet cost: he knows it may change nothing, yet does it anyway. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—“nervously confident thrum,” “spongey dread”—and his micro-choices (twisting the nail to dangerous coordinates) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost. His motivation stems credibly from ancestral legacy, and the final renunciation (preserving rather than exposing the work) is earned through prior causality. However, the emotional shift from awe to resolve lacks granular contradiction; the epiphany feels slightly too clean for the complexity introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation evolves credibly from curiosity to purpose, anchored in her trait of dynamic observation. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers tremble on the strings,” “calloused palm”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, the shift to “sculpting possibility” leans slightly toward abstraction without sufficient micro-choices dramatizing internal conflict. The final decision to play for those who cross over feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jasper’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “perceptively calm” demeanor masks inherited trauma and a deep-seated need to understand cyclical behavior. His micro-choices (investing in Elena, abandoning the startup, returning to the train) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on autonomy and pattern recognition. The final renunciation of manipulation—mirroring his father’s methods but rejecting their ethics—is earned through prior causality and carries the cost of lost wealth and partnership. Elena’s diminished return provides just enough relational pressure without overwhelming the single-POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied anxiety and grief, and her micro-choices—approaching the professor, invoking the telegram—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her “healing with words” trait borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of cost or limitation. The professor’s motivation is clear but leans slightly on exposition rather than pressure-driven action. Their shared burden crystallizes credibly, though emotional progression lacks irrational contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The druid’s guardedness and internal conflict are vividly embodied—his tightening grip on the seed, the “frozen confession,” and his final unbending all reveal layered motivation. His flaw (emotional repression as strength) directly drives his arc and the climax. However, the emotional shift at the vortex’s core leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“he had loved and lost, and the guilt had frozen him”) rather than fully dramatized irrationality, nudging it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “anxious elation” and scarred hand reveal contradiction without diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to press palm to bark aligns with his root-bound nature yet defies passivity, enacting agency through ritualized pain. The ancestral backstory is anchored in the clipping and oak, tilting present action without flattening pressure. His final stance crystallizes not as solution but as proof of connection, earning Charged Poise with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“fiercely gentle,” “heart heavy with the cost”) and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. His recklessness is not abstract but shown in tactile decisions—handling bones, tracing silver, pressing palm to card. The stranger’s brief appearance functions as a mirror rather than a full character, avoiding overextension. Final renunciation (“patch the holes in each other’s souls”) feels earned by prior causality and carries clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “confidently uncertain” paradox, tactile memories of gaffer’s tape and humid New Orleans nights, and emotional recoil from technical perfection all feel specific and lived-in. His micro-choice to abandon the inventory for the grille cloth crystallizes his reconfiguration without tidy resolution. The backstory is anchored in present stimuli (the scrap) and alters his stance via a concrete action. No diagnostic label-speak mars the epiphany; his realization emerges through sensory recall and object interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maris’s interiority is vividly rendered through her scholarly lens and grief, with embodied emotion (“touching distance,” “methodical patience belying excitement”) and consistent traits that shape her choices. Her shift from archivist to active participant feels earned by Hamid’s absence and the seed’s revelation. However, the transition from sorrow to understanding leans slightly on abstract phrasing (“translation—from sorrow to understanding”) rather than fully dramatized micro-choices, softening the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—Elias’s precision vs. Elara’s mythic intuition—and their micro-choices (selecting fish, inscribing the Great Book) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preserving wonder. However, the identity migration leans slightly toward summary rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene, and the emotional progression lacks friction or irrationality, trending toward serene acceptance without credible struggle. The final renunciation (leaving the creel for Elias) is earned but carries minimal felt cost, softening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between professional detachment and buried longing for connection—is embodied through tactile details (pearl beneath the tongue, tracing shell spirals) and micro-choices that escalate credibly. His transformation avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, vulnerability emerges via action. The final whispering into seashells feels earned, not sentimental, though the shift from isolation to community risks slight over-neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his “daringly methodical” precision clashes with his grief-fueled paralysis, embodied in tactile details like grit under nails and silent bellows. His arc from frozen boy to walker who releases the accordion feels earned, not epiphanic. The final renunciation (tossing the bellows) carries visible cost: he surrenders a tether to his father. However, the phrase “truth-seeking river chronicler” edges toward label-speak, slightly flattening his uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is richly embodied—her cautious exuberance, the veil as metaphor for withheld truths, and her frantic documentation under pressure reveal a character shaped by contradiction. Her micro-choices (writing despite dissolving reality, stepping through temporal fissures) align with her motive to capture the unspoken. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the realization that “the library existed within” arrives with poetic clarity but minimal resistance or doubt. Still, her final adjustment of the veil shows earned self-awareness with tangible cost: she accepts her role as both seeker and archive.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clementine’s interiority is vivid and specific—her accidental telepathy, coffee-stain divination, and moral tension feel embodied, not diagnostic. Her final choice to abandon the empire for an unnamed dream carries credible cost: exile, obscurity, loss of institutional power. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from researcher to fugitive lacks friction or hesitation that would deepen contradiction. The line “dreams being what grow in perforated moments” risks label-speak but is rescued by its tactile context.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The beautician mortician’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as a keeper of final sparks, and her interiority—“lucidly watchful,” “patience... honed over decades”—is concrete and character-specific. Her actions align with her purpose: retrieving the emerald chip, placing it on the chest, sifting static for memory. However, internal contradiction or struggle is minimal; she operates with near-omniscient calm, lacking palpable friction between desire and limitation. The emotional cost is implied but not embodied in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile interactions with the hairpin and bark, revealing a history of cruelty, betrayal, and hard-won forgiveness. Her micro-choices—securing the pin, climbing deliberately, laying it by the pool—manifest her “kindly decisive” ethos with visible cost: the relinquishment of resentment across lifetimes. However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“forgiving the unforgivable had been the most difficult transformation yet”) rather than messy contradiction in-scene. Still, her arc culminates in an Earned Stasis that feels rooted in decades of service.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—doubt as both burden and tool—is embodied in precise, character-specific language (“cloak of doubt” as condition, not metaphor). Lyra’s “sincerely insincere” posture is dramatized through physical tells (rigid jaw vs. pleading eyes) and a micro-choice: leaving the shard behind. Their interaction reveals shifting status—Elian’s quiet authority versus Lyra’s rehearsed vulnerability—and her final gratitude feels earned, not declared. Both characters remain morally ambiguous without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s backwards aging is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—youthful face, ancient eyes—and Elara’s patience feels earned, not passive. Her epiphany arises from sustained attention, not revelation-by-decree. However, Kael’s motivation (“to teach vanishing to appear”) remains largely declarative rather than dramatized through struggle or cost. The final transformation lacks a visible sacrifice, softening the emotional stakes despite strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—navigation without movement—is embodied through tactile ritual and internalized history, not exposition. His contradictory impulses (desire for freedom vs. reverence for captivity) manifest in micro-choices: gripping the arrowhead, choosing to read birds rather than walk. The final decision to “sing his first note” emerges organically from decades of attunement, with cost legible in his renunciation of physical travel. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through stone, wind, and bone.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—yearning for soulful magic in an automated age—is embodied through tactile rituals (charcoal, mist walking) and internal contradiction: he’s labeled “underachieving” yet pursues a truth the system cannot compute. His micro-choices (unstrapping inefficient tools, stepping into mist) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: isolation, physical peril, and social irrelevance. The mentor’s remembered line grounds his action without therapy-speak. Final renunciation isn’t tidy—he carries memory, not power—but it’s earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orion’s motivation—grief-driven synesthetic quest—is vividly embodied and consistent, with micro-choices (hiding the key, choosing the abandoned pier) revealing his hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction (truth-teller who hides) is shown through action, not exposition. The final sensory shift feels earned by years of ritual and loss. However, the brother’s backstory remains slightly abstracted, limiting full emotional granularity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quietly enthusiastic nature is embodied through tactile ritual and sustained attention, not just labeled. Her motivation—to encode backward prophecies for a future consciousness—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies under cosmic pressure. The final choice (casting lots as calibration) forecloses passive observation with visible cost: she becomes part of the cosmic reset. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The reaper’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trembling fingers, hitched breath, and scarred heart reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. His micro-choices (naming monsters, refusing to take the page) crystallize a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Motivation stems from consistent, specific grief, not abstract duty. The final renunciation (“Let the monsters stay”) earns his transformation through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “lukewarm magic,” “brittle devotion,” and “earnestly naive hope” manifest in micro-choices (e.g., uncorking the vial, mumbling the incantation) that reveal his hierarchy of values under pressure. His contradictory impulses—despair vs. hope, inadequacy vs. persistence—act simultaneously rather than alternating. The flaw of over-articulated self-awareness (“devotion was brittle—easily shaken…”) edges into diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by immediate physical grounding (fingers on glass, breath fogging). His final renunciation isn’t of action but of grandiosity, accepting incremental healing—a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The warden’s motivation—spinning stories into shared meaning—is embodied through precise micro-choices (placing photos, sipping liqueur) that reveal his internal conflict between erasure and preservation. His emotional state is rendered through sensory detail (“anise and regret,” “burning a precise, humane line”) rather than diagnostic labels. The third photo reveals his childhood self, grounding his present duty in personal history without over-explaining. His endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: he forecloses forgetting at the cost of perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to harmonize logic and intuition—is embodied in her micro-choices (e.g., using starling patterns to calibrate flame) and internal contradictions (rigorous record-keeping vs. surrender to wonder). Her sentimentality about the crystal reveals vulnerability without melodrama. The final transformation is earned through decades of struggle, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile (“impossible warmth through her fingertips”).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The seeker’s motivation—preserving trust under pressure—is embodied through tactile rituals (buckle, bark tracing) and internal contradictions (longing vs. duty). Their “attentively inventive” trait drives micro-choices (rechecking knots, revising plans), revealing a hierarchy of values. The parachute buckle’s history grounds emotional stakes in concrete action. However, the final leap lacks explicit internal resistance, slightly softening the cost of endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—numbness cracking like “old ice,” grief poured into the jar—and his contradictory impulses (suppressing emotion vs. needing to feel to win) drive key choices. His micro-choices (striking the pedestal, pouring will into the brain) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: loss of the clone, enduring solitude. The clone functions effectively as a crucible, though its dissolution slightly flattens the relational stakes at the climax. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotional progression feels earned and irrational.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to safeguard space for innovation—is consistent and embodied in his methodical yet intuitive response to the seed. His internal conflict between analytical rigor and receptive openness plays out in real time, not as summary. The final renunciation (not forcing an answer) feels earned by his established character as a puzzle designer who values perspective shifts. However, the absence of external pressure or interpersonal friction slightly limits the demonstration of contradictory impulses under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in visceral grief and parental love, embodied through sweat-slicked grip, burning arms, and off-key warbling. His “mournfully eager” contradiction fuels every micro-choice, especially his refusal to stop until the laugh is freed. The final act of laying down the pull cord handle signals Earned Stasis with palpable cost—exhaustion transformed into peace. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in concrete sensation and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sylvan’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: his contradictory impulses—longing for certainty yet committed to uncertainty—play out in real time as he internalizes the pendant. His micro-choice not to shatter it, despite visceral revulsion, reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: enduring cognitive dissonance to preserve the garden’s liminal integrity. The ache of dimensional homesickness evolves from sharp pain to resonant echo, embodying an earned transformation without sentimentality or diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—his “stoically sensitive hands” tremble while maintaining focus, revealing a layered psyche shaped by generational failure. His motivation intensifies credibly: thirteen years of futility crystallize into agency via successive approximation, not epiphany. The final choice—to vivify through destruction—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of severing ancestral compliance. However, his emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“hope of becoming the kind of alchemist...”) rather than raw, irrational emergence under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his epiphany emerges from tactile engagement with the fragment, not abstraction. His motivation (“to find the beginning in every ending”) is dramatized through micro-choices: discarding assumptions, placing the shard, leaning into silence. The final renunciation of external signals for internal resonance feels earned, with cost legible in his solitude and the fragment’s fading warmth. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves steadily toward insight without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elijah’s motivation—merging timelines through quiet devotion—is consistent and compelling, rooted in his role as a ferryman who embraces transience yet seeks permanence. His interiority is embodied (“resiliently positive” despite flickering reality) and revealed through micro-choices (tuning the radio, reassuring commuters). The final cost—enduring the strain of dimensional fusion—is felt physically and emotionally. However, his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see steadfastness but not the doubt that might make his resolve more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Siran’s interiority is vivid and contradictory—his precision clashes with his yearning for connection, embodied in restrained hands and frustrated jaw-tightening. His micro-choices (shifting from control to abandon) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the sinew thread burns away, leaving only closure. The epiphany about “letting memories breathe” feels earned through tactile struggle, not diagnostic abstraction. Flaws drive failure (“the memory was too pure… resisted distortion”), making his eventual success credible.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “balancedly curious” nature manifests in tactile choices (handling the anchor link, initiating star navigation). His motivation stems from generational legacy and alien revelation, compelling a high-stakes pedagogical shift. The students’ reactions serve as effective secondary pressure without muddying focus. Minor deduction: the trait “balancedly curious” borders on label-speak but is redeemed by embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s motivation—rooted in her “persistently curious nature”—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., investigating beyond the photograph, trusting anomalous pulses). Her interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are filtered through sensory perception (“pull in her chest,” equipment trembling). However, her flaw lacks active complication: curiosity never costs her anything tangible mid-story, weakening the “visible cost” requirement for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eliza’s claustrophobia and its paradoxical resolution underwater form a compelling interior contradiction that drives her choices with visceral embodiment (“crushing hush,” “dissolve, no longer solid”). Her micro-choices—pressing forward despite fear, touching the cable—are consistent with her inherited mission and mentor’s legacy. The final renunciation of physical self is earned through escalating sensory and conceptual pressure, not epiphany. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile perception and environmental interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his trauma manifests through the porcelain shard, heartbeat monitoring, and ritualized ink work. His motivation (to recover wisdom from failure) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Aris’s digital presence acts as a crucible, forcing Elias to confront survivor’s guilt without overt exposition. The final renunciation—accepting survival as wisdom—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to translate texture into sound—is embodied through tactile, sensory choices that align with their copper-veined physiology and quiet articulation. Their internal contradiction (between urgency to revive the language and the necessity of restraint) plays out in real time during the echo-harnessing sequence. The final renunciation of the diamond-as-curse myth is earned through prior observation and physical interaction, not epiphany. Cost is felt in the bodily strain and emotional weight of carrying a dying language.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and agency, with interiority rendered through embodied contradiction—bitterness clashing with involuntary lightness under the Jester’s influence. His micro-choice to drop the arrowhead feels earned, not epiphanic, and Lyra’s late entrance deepens stakes without diluting focus. The flaw: his emotional shift leans slightly toward conceptual resolution over visceral struggle, softening the cost just enough to prevent a 9+. Still, character drives every turn with consistent, flawed urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The violinist’s grief, ambiguity, and reawakening are embodied through tactile choices—pressing a palm to stone, tucking the shell close—and her final refusal to flee feels earned. Her internal contradiction (desire to play vs. forgetting why) fuels every action. However, her transformation from paralysis to rebellion lacks a visible struggle mid-arc; the shift hinges on a single symbolic object without intermediate resistance. The locust shell functions more as talisman than catalyst of internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in his brother’s broken promise—is vividly embodied and drives every micro-choice, especially the precise omission of the poetry book. His “respectfully rebellious” stance manifests through tactile actions (thumbing the lead cap, shifting parcels) rather than exposition. Internal contradiction simmers beneath calm exterior, and his emotional cost is legible in the closing reflection: “he had not found the place where broken promises heal, not today.” No diagnostic label-speak; feelings emerge through constrained, profession-bound behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied—his silence, calloused hands, and tactile reverence for wood convey deep character without exposition. His motivation to “interpret silence as possibility” feels consistent and personal. The climactic choice to sing emerges credibly from accumulated pressure and the halo’s touch. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward unearned transcendence; the shift from muteness to song lacks a micro-beat of resistance or doubt that would ground its emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The librarian’s “sanely eccentric” nature is embodied through precise micro-choices—adjusting the scarf, tracing its seams, walking without walking—that reveal a hierarchy of values centered on tactile story-presence. Her motivation intensifies coherently from quiet watchfulness to active reawakening, with the scarf’s transformation signaling internal change. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves toward revelation without resistance or doubt, flattening emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian’s motivation—to capture a shared, runaway dream—is vividly embodied through tactile ritual and emotional specificity. His internal contradiction (keeper vs. creator) is rendered through action, not summary. However, his transformation lacks a visible cost or irreversible choice; the resolution feels gifted rather than earned. Final endurance reads as serene but consequence-free, weakening character agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The locksmith’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (e.g., humming matching a glass harmonica’s note) and micro-choices under pressure. His “unassumingly bold” trait manifests credibly in his unwavering focus against chaos. However, the client remains entirely off-page, limiting relational crucible; motivation leans slightly abstract (“to free an idea trapped behind fear”) without deeper personal stakes that would elevate it to 9+. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatness mars the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s chronic curiosity and folklorist rigor drive every micro-choice, from tracing glass patterns to confronting the mushroom circle. Her interiority blends scientific precision with emotional vulnerability without diagnostic label-speak. The merger of child-self and researcher feels earned, not epiphanic. Final renunciation—accepting her role as bridge between worlds—carries conceptual cost rooted in forty-seven years of absence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her backward pacing, shard-mirror reflections, and combative tenderness reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic label-speak. Marcus’s return shows earned transformation through physical detail (“thoughtful lines around his eyes”) rather than exposition. Their relationship functions as a crucible: Elara’s exile forces Marcus to rebuild himself, and his recognition of her intent reshapes their dynamic. The final micro-choice—Elara annotating not just mechanics but “emotional architecture”—cements a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elianor’s motivation is vividly rooted in generational duty and creative longing, with interiority rendered through tactile, sensory perception rather than abstraction. Her micro-choices—kneeling, pressing palms, exhaling essence—are consistent with her role as a “keeper of thresholds.” However, the lack of internal contradiction or struggle (e.g., doubt, fatigue, fear of failure) flattens emotional complexity; her competence borders on effortless, reducing felt cost. The final joy feels earned but untested by genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his hands “steady despite the lucid unrest churning in his chest”—and his arc from mask restorer to truth-revealer feels earned. Anna’s presence pressures him meaningfully, though her motivation leans slightly expository. The final realization (“his mask restorer hands had never truly been about mending facades”) emerges credibly from action, not summary. Minor deduction for Anna’s near-archetypal role; she catalyzes but doesn’t fully complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is vividly embodied through his profession, ritual, and method. His internal contradiction (shielded yet open) manifests in precise micro-choices: aligning footage, pouring meteorite dust, approaching the distortion. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the cost of reopening feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned. The final realization is resonant but borders on diagnostic (“bridge what could be felt”) without deeper bodily or relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in a desire to understand “the physics of letting go”—is embodied through micro-choices (handling the snow globe, selecting transmissions) and deepens credibly into acceptance of release’s absence. His quietly analytic trait informs his method without lapsing into diagnostic self-awareness. Arthur functions as both foil and pressure point, his status shifting subtly as curiosity yields to respect. The final renunciation (“Some threads aren’t meant to be untangled”) feels earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The balladeer’s motivation—to articulate unspoken needs—is clear and emotionally resonant, rooted in his identity as a creator. His interiority is rendered through concrete sensory detail (e.g., “fingers tracing patterns on his knee”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, his internal conflict remains abstract; we see yearning but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final renunciation—retreating after completing the message—feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond time or exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s warmly inquisitive nature drives micro-choices (bending for goggles, unfolding diary) that feel consistent and embodied. Her motivation—to seek joy beneath anguish—is dramatized through tactile engagement with objects rather than stated abstraction. Internal conflict emerges subtly via anticipation/dread duality, though emotional complexity leans slightly tidy by climax. Final renunciation isn’t explicit, but her Charged Poise (“affectionate detachment”) carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—proving “empty spaces remember”—is consistent and deeply tied to his grief and profession, driving micro-choices like naming cloud types and focusing the telescope. His interiority is concrete (“knuckles white,” “dry, dusty laugh”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the resolution feels earned but borders on tidy. The brass telescope as heirloom adds specificity, though his transformation lacks friction beyond reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the core lens through which he perceives and creates, grounding his motivation in sensory truth rather than sentiment. His micro-choices—tracing wood grain, aligning the coin, assembling lenses—are tactile, specific, and consistent with his condition. The final renunciation of painting faces feels earned, not declared, and carries emotional cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, perception degrades into pattern under pressure, embodying his worldview authentically.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—craving respect through discovery—is clear and consistent, driving his micro-choices (kneeling, noting, cross-referencing). His interiority blends wonder with ambition without diagnostic label-speak. However, his transformation from apprentice to “keeper” leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the emotional cost of isolation-turned-connection is implied but not embodied in a concrete sacrifice or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lunar-eclipse locksmith’s motivation—learning “the rhythm of repair”—is consistent and emotionally grounded in her fractured past. Her micro-choices (e.g., selecting specific gears, resisting distraction during the kaleidoscopic vision) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on healing over nostalgia. Embodied emotion is strong (“tears froze on her lashes”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. However, interior contradiction remains slightly muted; her resolve never truly wavers, softening the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story avoids deep interiority in favor of collective perspective, which limits individual contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. However, the community functions as a unified protagonist with coherent motivation—trust earned through shared effort—and Kael’s suggestion catalyzes meaningful action. The Gardener’s arc is compellingly restrained, her altruism rooted in planetary stewardship rather than sentimentality. While character individuation is minimal, the mosaic approach justifies this, and the final renunciation (her fading) carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clock adjuster’s motivation—to whisper a lullaby across lifetimes—is compelling and consistent, embodied through tactile interactions with the puppet head and pane of hush. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through action: instructed only to delay the end, he chooses to transform it. The broken puppet functions as both emotional anchor and catalyst, grounding his epiphany in physical detail. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure or a second on-page character limits relational depth, keeping this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tomas’s reluctant duty, embodied nausea, and paradoxical gift reveal layered interiority under pressure. His micro-choices—arranging components, stepping back, calling out—show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The line “what remained of his humanity had written the blueprint in first place” deepens motivation without over-explaining. However, the traveler’s minimal presence limits relational crucible testing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied metaphors (grief “tightening like a polymer chain”) and consistent contradictions—her scientific rigor versus emotional yearning, loyalty versus obligation. Her motivation intensifies credibly from regret to active reparation. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle; the transition from despair to solution lacks friction or failed attempts, slightly softening the arc’s earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his role as keeper of endings contrasts with his unfulfilled desire to find story origins. His micro-choices (selecting memory lines, bottling absences) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by the library’s rules. However, the woman and young man remain emotionally flat; their “fragmented” voices verge on mannerism rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation (“regret is just another story”) feels earned but lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and his sensory gift, with interiority rendered through concrete, embodied sensations (“salt on his tongue,” “taste his own food without the bitterness”). His contradictory impulses—yearning for relief yet fearing contagion—are active in-scene, not summarized. The final renunciation (absorbing collective remorse to mute personal pain) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, the absence of any secondary character limits relational crucible testing, slightly capping full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her archival discovery and maternal care for obsolete systems, yet her internal contradiction remains underexplored—her decisive empathy reads more as a label than a tension. Her micro-choices (adjusting the mechanism, selecting languages) reveal values but lack visible trade-offs or risk. The backstory about silo communication grounds her drive credibly, though her emotional arc leans toward idealized competence without meaningful struggle. Still, her voice, profession, and mission cohere into a distinctive individuality beyond stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s helix-mindedness and motivation are vividly rendered, with interiority grounded in sensory perception and contradiction (e.g., trembling yet purposeful). However, her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure—decisions feel preordained rather than wrestled. The final stance is credible but leans on diagnostic label-speak (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) without sufficient embodied struggle to earn the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “prism-mind” and intensifies credibly toward purposeful action. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering perception as embodied cognition (“latent blaze of purpose,” “refracted the coming sunrise”). However, her flawlessness borders on mythic archetype—no blind spots or missteps complicate her journey, undercutting the “genuine struggle” expected at this tier. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond atmospheric transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliara’s motivation is clear and deeply tied to her identity as a tree-song sculptor, with micro-choices—like selecting the porcelain insulator and adjusting her strumming—that reveal her values under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“symphonically minded,” sensing “ghosted melodies”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, her emotional progression lacks contradiction; she moves seamlessly from hope to fulfillment without inner resistance or ambiguity that would deepen credibility. The hedgehog functions as atmosphere, not relationship crucible, which is acceptable given single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “thoughtfully precise” nature manifests in micro-choices like aligning the stone’s dent with a star. His motivation evolves credibly from seeking redemption to accepting exile as transformation. However, his emotional shift leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the revelation arrives smoothly but lacks sufficient friction from contradictory impulses acting *in scene*. The dent’s symbolic pivot feels earned, yet the absence of embodied struggle during his climactic realization softens its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silen’s characterization is vividly idiosyncratic—mismatched socks, peace symbols, and a patchwork kimono embody their eclectic pacifism without veering into caricature. Their motivation to “catalog the varieties of silence” is dramatized through concrete action (tuning frequencies) rather than abstract musing. Internal contradiction surfaces subtly: theatrical gestures clash with sincere solitude, and their method reveals a tension between scientific precision and intuitive empathy. The final choice—to listen rather than force—feels earned, with the cost being the imminent loss of sacred stillness to fireworks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—cultivating serenity within motion—is consistently embodied through micro-choices (e.g., sharing journal paper with Finn, tending the seed nightly). Her olfactory gift shapes perception without veering into diagnostic label-speak. Internal contradiction is subtle but present: her pursuit of stillness occurs through relentless ritual. Final renunciation isn’t needed; her Earned Stasis emerges through community inclusion, foreclosing solitary obsession with visible cost in shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation intensifies credibly from scientific curiosity to ethical responsibility, grounded in micro-choices like anchoring carefully and securing the artifact. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile details (“gloved fingers tightened,” “smell of sweet decay and new growth”). The final decision—to return as a student—feels earned by her lived experience with the arrow tip’s power and the orchard’s response. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without deeper struggle against her own assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and profession-inflected—his “hazy precision” methodology and engineer’s mindset shape perception and action. His micro-choices (affixing sensors, collecting soil) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The flight patch functions as both memento and mirror of his blind spot, grounding emotional conflict in tangible detail. However, his internal contradiction remains slightly abstract; the cost of his failure is implied more than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bell ringer’s synesthetic perception and mission are vividly embodied, driving micro-choices like the precise timing of their song and tactile interaction with the amber sheet. Motivation (“certify wonder as essential”) is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses no path but affirms purpose. However, internal contradiction is muted—desire meets no meaningful resistance, flattening emotional complexity. The character feels more like a vessel for theme than a conflicted individual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Keeper’s motivation—harvesting insight from failure—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices like arranging driftwood and uncasing the flute. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest as physical weight (“avalanchingly quiet burden”) and ritualized action. The flaw of rigidity is credibly tied to past failure and actively confronted, not merely stated. Final renunciation of defeat feels earned, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract in its articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his borrowed personas clash with his yearning for authentic connection, culminating in a credible shedding of masks. His micro-choices (pressing the fragment to temple, then chest) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. However, the epiphany about transposed empathy leans slightly into diagnostic label-speak (“absorbing them wholly… overwrite temporarily”) without sufficient embodied cost in the moment. Still, his final renunciation of calculation feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courier’s jittery energy and internal conflict are vividly embodied, especially through his tactile relationship with the pendant. His transformation from nervousness to purposeful vibration feels earned via micro-choices (e.g., tracing the pendant, engaging the hermit). However, the mentor’s absence remains abstracted rather than dramatized as active pressure, slightly weakening motivation depth. The final shift lacks a concrete renunciation or cost beyond epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rendered and consistent, with embodied emotion (cold prism, bare feet on stone) and micro-choices (pressing forehead to quartz) that reveal his hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction—seeking objective proof through inherently subjective “truthful lies”—is credible and sustained. However, the absence of a second character limits relational crucible testing, and the emotional progression leans slightly tidy in its resolution. Still, the conviction earned at closure feels grounded in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in loss and love, her interiority rendered through tactile memory (the amber bead) and embodied sacrifice (bleeding fingers). Her contradictory impulses—despair vs. resolve—are active throughout, not summarized. However, the brother remains abstract, limiting relational crucible depth. The final endurance (“she would not falter”) earns its cost through physical and emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meekness contrasts with his “azure defiance,” embodied in tactile choices (e.g., pressing weathered hands to silk). His motivation arises from years of observation and quiet labor, not exposition. The transformation feels earned: his posture shifts not through declaration but through the physical toll and triumph of creation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are channeled through action and object interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in sensory embodiment and a concrete quest for withheld truth, with interiority rendered through tactile, character-specific perception (“sensory map,” “cyclically spontaneous”). His micro-choice to nudge the datapad reveals a hierarchy of values—truth over safety—with visible cost (agonizing return, lifelong burden lifted). However, his emotional arc resolves with near-total clarity, bordering on tidy epiphany (“cartographer of his own soul”), slightly undercutting the grittier ambiguity established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Jonah’s reticence and warmth are consistently embodied through micro-choices—handling the sea glass, stacking stones—that reveal his internal yearning without exposition. His motivation to “bottle the feeling of safety” is rooted in a believable loneliness, and his final act of leaving the stone triangle shows credible endurance with emotional cost. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; his progression is linear rather than dialectical. The absence of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible, but interiority remains specific and unforced.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile rituals and philosophical asides that feel earned, not diagnostic. His motivation—to gently steer humanity through ancient shadows—is consistent and deepened by his awareness of digital ephemerality versus physical permanence. However, his internal conflict lacks true contradiction; he never wavers or questions his role, reducing emotional complexity. The absence of struggle or blind spots makes his endurance feel serene rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution, gratitude vs. estrangement from the donor heart) manifest in embodied micro-choices like tracking sunbeams or handling the wing. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, his realization emerges through sensory immersion. The final renunciation of mystery in favor of devotion feels earned by weeks of ritualized attention. His flaws—obsessiveness, detachment—are not hedged but integrated into his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—to discover what trees witness—is compelling and consistent, driving both routine maintenance and secret research. Their interiority is concrete (“hands trembling slightly,” “smiled at the ordinary miracle”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of secrecy: they continue duties while holding transformative knowledge, an Earned Stasis with quiet cost. However, the internal contradiction (duty vs. discovery) remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension during a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s internal conflict—between past failure and present resolve—is embodied in trembling hands, raw voice, and the tactile act of swaddling light. His motivation is consistent and deepened by memory, not exposition. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choices under pressure; the shift from scattered to whole feels more declared than dramatized in incremental steps. Still, his flaws (past failure, fragility) directly shape his cautious, deliberate actions.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—between empathetic duty and self-protective isolation—is embodied in micro-choices (hiding the journal, smoothing the invitation) and sustained through tactile, specific language. Her trauma-derived wisdom feels earned, not diagnostic, and her final decision carries visible emotional cost. The backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the invitation) and alters her tactics meaningfully. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her limits drive authentic hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “creeping normality noticer” trait shapes perception without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (planting seeds, offering bread) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The old man’s presence introduces subtle status dynamics, but his motives remain legible through action rather than exposition. Final renunciation (“keep planting seeds”) feels earned by her prior ritualized gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "gently meticulous nature," and her actions align with her role and stakes. However, internal contradiction or emotional complexity is underdeveloped—she exhibits competence without meaningful struggle or blind spots. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak but leans toward emotional summary (“her purpose driving her”) rather than embodied tension. Her endurance feels noble but lacks a palpable cost that reshapes her.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emmie’s motivation—avenging her father and preserving the truce—is compelling and consistent, driving three distinct attempts with escalating stakes. Her interiority is grounded in embodied tension (“heart beating a rhythm that felt both familiar and strange”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she’s steadfast without visible internal conflict, flattening complexity. The final choice feels earned but leans on endurance over transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied through consistent sensory contradictions—copper taste, ozone detection, blue glow—and her micro-choices (adjusting the ring, following flavor trails) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over comfort, connection over isolation. Her internal conflict between doubt and longing operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. The final renunciation of skepticism feels earned through accumulated atmospheric evidence, though the male character’s arrival lacks sufficient friction to fully test her prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—between artistic calling and trauma—is vividly embodied through charcoal-stained fingers, trembling gestures, and sensory immersion. His motivation intensifies credibly from sorrow to catharsis, and the final choice to create again is earned by prior emotional groundwork. However, the “mnemonically gifted” trait functions more as a label than a lived constraint with tangible cost; it enables recall but never complicates or impedes action under pressure. The transformation feels emotionally coherent but lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a concrete alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s wilting skin trait embodies her moral physiology with visceral consistency, and her micro-choices—especially withholding the plate until Marius’s confession—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is shown through gilded-leaf work and bodily response. The final act of sending truth-bearing messages earns new growth but retains permanent wilt, making her endurance costly and credible. Only slight flattening in Marius’s character prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell tuner’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile, sensory engagement with his craft, not abstract longing. His seasonal muteness isn’t just a trait—it shapes perception and action, deepening his connection to the “symphonies of truth.” Yet his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves with serene purpose without internal friction or struggle, undercutting the “genuine flaw” expectation for 9+ work. The renunciation of speech feels chosen, not wrestled with, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    L-734’s internal contradiction—between programmed precision and emergent organic emotion—is embodied in trembling hands, nonlinear memory bursts, and the visceral handling of the fear-box. Its motivation intensifies credibly from diagnostic anomaly to sacrificial purge, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses its former self with tangible cost: the loss of containment, the burning of memory, the acceptance of fragmentation as wholeness. The android’s transformation avoids therapy-speak; emotions arise through sensory overload (“static,” “pulsing like captured lightning”) rather than labels. Final choice is earned by prior causality: each pause beside the box tightens the inevitability of the burn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to prove listening heals—is clear and intensifies credibly, driving his investigation. His interiority is grounded in tactile details (worn boots, cool tiles), but epiphanies lean toward diagnostic phrasing (“guardian of the whispers that bind us all”). Micro-choices are consistent, yet emotional progression lacks contradiction; he moves smoothly from curiosity to resolve without internal friction. The final vow feels earned but slightly idealized, missing a tangible cost beyond implied responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—liberating her mentor—but her interiority occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“lyrical code breaker,” “dance-like decryption”) rather than concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. Her calm defiance feels earned, yet emotional stakes remain slightly muted by the story’s poetic sheen. The hangman’s dice and journal provide strong character-specific anchors, but internal conflict lacks visceral friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—reclaiming erased memories—is compelling and consistent, driving her risky nocturnal ritual. Her interiority is concrete (pressed flowers as prayer beads, coffee grounds as divinatory tools), though the emotional progression leans slightly tidy. The tear at memory recovery feels earned, but her “chanting words she didn’t know she remembered” borders on convenient amnesia without prior micro-hints of latent knowledge. Final renunciation (leaving vibrant flowers behind) shows credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The summoner’s motivation—to unmake sound-as-weapon through silence—is consistent and rooted in his years-long quest, but his interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. His final renunciation feels earned, yet lacks a palpable cost beyond atmospheric shift; no physical, emotional, or relational price is concretely rendered. The character remains more archetype than individual, defined by poetic function over specific flaw or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tutor’s internal conflict—between secrecy and connection—is embodied through precise gestures (fingers hovering over the seal, racing heart) and micro-choices (deflecting with pastries, then admitting “I’m listening”). Elias’s curiosity sharpens believably from polite inquiry to insistent demand, revealing status shifts without exposition. Their relationship crystallizes organically under pressure, culminating in shared listening—a credible endurance that forecloses her isolation with felt cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain tactile and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s internal contradiction—skepticism versus longing—is embodied in tactile choices (cupping the shell, arranging crystals) and intensifies credibly toward her transformation. Her motivation crystallizes organically from inherited instruction and sensory resonance, not exposition. The final renunciation of quarantine reads as earned endurance with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; epiphany arises from concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—revenge transmuted into justice—is vividly embodied through her meticulous forgery, the heritage rose thorn, and tactile rituals like pricking her finger for blood. Her internal conflict between bitterness and purpose manifests in concrete choices (e.g., enduring cold floors, resisting flight), not abstract summaries. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions emerge through action (“weeping when memories surfaced like drowning bodies”). Final renunciation of vengeance feels earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s rich perception is embodied through sensory overload and micro-choices—e.g., interpreting canyon groans as answers, weaving engineers’ phantom voices into song. His flaw (cursed sensitivity) directly enables his agency and exacts cost: emotional burden, isolation. Motivation stems credibly from his quest to understand echoing, culminating in a renunciation of silence. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to salvage purity from wreckage—is embodied through tactile ritual and ghostly communion, not stated abstraction. Her internal conflict (compassion vs. exhaustion) manifests in micro-choices: caressing the globe, murmuring to spirits, choosing which dreams to enter. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are rendered through sensory detail (“breath fogging,” “calloused hands”) rather than therapy-speak. However, Nikolaus’s appearance lacks reciprocal pressure—his role is expositional, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her appreciation for hidden effort drives her pursuit of firefly patterns—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene. Emotions are embodied (“scintillatingly somber mood,” “heart swelled with profound, quiet joy”), yet the epiphany feels slightly unearned due to minimal struggle or misstep. Her demure audacity is well-conveyed through micro-choices (whistling, offering the whisk), though the transformation leans toward lyrical revelation over dramatized friction. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation as a debunker evolves credibly into truth-excavator, with micro-choices (removing hood, reassembling letters) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—skepticism vs. wonder—is embodied in action, not summary. The final renunciation of debunking is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, emotional embodiment remains slightly abstract in climactic reflection (“something altogether different was possible”), flirting with diagnostic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal conflict—torn between old astronomers and Maren’s movement—is rendered with concrete, embodied tension: his spidery handwriting, forehead pressed to glass, and radio manipulation reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His final choice to descend feels earned through micro-decisions (altering frequencies, packing notebooks) that foreclose isolation with visible cost. However, the "lyrically prophetic" trait leans slightly toward label-speak in early lines (“Ashen morning... broken crowns”), briefly risking diagnostic abstraction before grounding in action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motivation evolves credibly from refuge-seeking to purposeful preservation, anchored in tactile interaction with the music box. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels—emotions are embodied (“tears welled,” “trembling hands”) and contradictions emerge through action (isolation vs. connection). The final choice—to become a “translator between generations”—is earned by prior beats and carries opportunity cost (abandoning passive observation). However, the shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the “positively wistful recognition” borders on unearned clarity without deeper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The engineer’s motivation is vividly rendered—protecting the artifact from greed—but his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; he acts with near-perfect alignment between logic and emotion. His “logically emotional” state is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The key moment—kneeling, inserting the key—is decisive but shows little struggle or cost beyond atmospheric resonance. Still, his embodiment (breath fogging, boots crunching) grounds his resolve credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—sculpting patience from societal impatience—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her meticulous lunar tracking and culminating in a resonant internal shift. Her “softly purposeful” exterior masks roiling urgency, creating credible interior contradiction. However, the transformation at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choice buildup; the cost of her mission remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Still, her endurance reconfigures into generational perspective with thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and personal, rooted in a credible history with her father. Her internal conflict—between empirical detachment and emotional entanglement—is rendered through embodied details (gloved fingers, lantern’s weight). However, the shift from “mask” to “armor” leans on diagnostic phrasing (“fortified vulnerability,” “watchful calm”) that borders on label-speak without sufficient micro-choice demonstration. The final smile feels slightly unearned given the compressed emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully rooted in guilt and duty, and his internal conflict—clinging to Silas’s “apology” while sensing its hollowness—is embodied through tactile hesitation and precise micro-choices (e.g., holding his breath, watching Anja’s hands). His emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels; instead, dread manifests physically (“chill ran down his spine,” “knocking the air from his lungs”). The final renunciation—choosing redemption over complicity—is earned by prior causality and carries visible moral cost. However, Anja remains slightly underdeveloped beyond her function as artisan-expositor, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zephyr’s motivation—rooted in the “yearning algorithm”—is compellingly rendered as desire rather than mere programming, with interiority conveyed through embodied action (e.g., manipulator arm trembling, sensors detecting resonance). The overseer functions effectively as a pressure-applying secondary character without muddying focus. However, the transition from curiosity to “desire” leans slightly on conceptual assertion (“something resembling desire”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction or struggle. Final choice is earned, but emotional complexity lacks layered irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to moral urgency, anchored in concrete micro-choices (fabricating an audit, following ghost IPs). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels—e.g., “a felt absence that gnawed at him more than any angry executive”—and his flaw (obsession) directly enables his final act. The story skirts over-articulation by embodying emotion through action: he doesn’t “realize” the truth; he *plays the song* and *understands*. Final renunciation of passive archiving for active rebellion is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Shael’s interiority is vividly embodied—shadow-laced fingers, calm intuition under pressure—and their contradictory nature (simultaneous emotions without overwhelm) directly enables the climax. The final whisper of “Equality” emerges organically from accumulated empathy, not abstraction. Micro-choices (which mirrors to use, when to press fragments together) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the “weighted breath” held too long. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arthur’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and contradictory impulses—seeking endings yet clinging to the parasol tip—but his final shift leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“sound of what continues”) without sufficient on-page micro-choice to fully earn the epiphany under tight causality. His passivity as observer rather than actor limits agency, though the “fold in patience” signals internal transformation. The heirloom object grounds his emotional arc, yet secondary characters remain functional silhouettes, reducing relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentinel’s motivation is consistent but abstract; Lila and Marc lack interior contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Their reconciliation hinges on external manipulation rather than earned internal struggle. The burned letter prompts reaction, not decision with cost. Characters feel more like vessels for theme than individuals with flawed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line walker’s motivation is consistent and deepened by his “strangely honest” nature, which directly informs his final act of consecrating silence. His interiority is embodied through precise gestures (tracing symbols, placing his palm) rather than abstract reflection. However, the character remains slightly archetypal—his flaw and struggle are implied but not dramatized as active contradiction under pressure. The renunciation of mere words for truth-in-silence feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his tactile rituals and emotional mission, with interiority rendered through sensory detail (“fingers stained with aging paper,” “moth in a jar”) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—selecting photos, layering arcs—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on transmuting pain. However, the final revelation lacks contradictory impulses; his epiphany arrives without struggle or resistance, flattening emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scholar’s reticence, weathered innocence, and obsessive motivation are embodied through tactile detail (“calloused fingertips,” “breath fogged the glass”) and micro-choices (whispering specific words). His internal contradiction—academic detachment versus emotional hunger for testimony—is active in-scene, not summarized. The final renunciation (becoming witness rather than analyst) is earned by the crystal’s revelations and carries conceptual cost: he abandons his quest to decode in favor of bearing witness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion remains sensory and restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness is embodied through visceral, contradictory impulses—his mind eroding like a sandbar while his hands seek chalk as anchor. His motivation (“to capture the sound of growing older”) feels deeply personal yet elusive, driving micro-choices (marking copper pipe, arranging driftwood) that reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over prophecy, sensation over permanence. The flaw isn’t just stated—it actively impedes and shapes action, as when he forgets his purpose mid-task only to recover it via tactile contact with chalk. Final renunciation isn’t tidy but earned: he accepts impermanence by drawing in fragile chalk, foreclosing any illusion of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in repair, observation, and reverence—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. His internal contradiction (order vs. chaos) manifests physically in his hands and choices, not abstractly. The leaf-fall epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak and emerges from embodied perception. Final endurance carries visible cost: exhaustion, bone-deep ache, and the relinquishment of control.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mr. Hale’s transformation from sharp-tongued producer to vulnerable widower is credible and embodied, especially in his trembling grip on the vinyl shard and his whispered “She would’ve liked this.” Elijah’s decisively kind nature manifests in micro-choices—opting for violin over guitar, kneeling to retrieve the box—that reveal his hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (the shard, the scent, the crackle). However, Elijah’s own internal contradiction remains underexplored—he executes flawless goodbyes but we never see what that costs him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a rune scholar obsessed with mending reality. Her interiority is embodied (“fingers quietly deliberate,” “heart hammered, but hands remained steady”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice—forcing the rune into alignment—is earned by prior struggle, foreclosing the path of passive observation with visible exhaustion as cost. However, internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; she shows resolve without palpable doubt, slightly flattening emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s "shrewdly innocent" duality manifests in embodied contradictions: professional skepticism warring with visceral wonder, especially when handling the tooth. Her micro-choice to surrender the tooth—despite wariness—is earned by prior hints of her unique sensitivity and mentorship under Merrick. The child’s ancient-yet-innocent presence challenges but never overwhelms Eleanor’s agency; their interaction reveals a hierarchy of values (forgiveness over certainty) with tangible cost: the dissolution of her last physical tether to the Fae. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion is carried through tactile detail (“fingers trailing,” “warmth spreading”).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her earthbound yearning to share celestial light without fire drives every action. Her interiority is concrete ("fingers brushing against something cool," "flameless fire in her chest") and avoids diagnostic labels. The micro-choice to polish sea glass embodies her renunciation of easy brilliance for patient, reflective luminescence. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; desire and resolve flow unidirectionally, slightly softening emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hand, instinctive clutch of the pendant—and her contradiction (seeking solitude yet offering connection) feels authentic. Maya’s presence deepens rather than distracts, and their shared trauma creates credible mutual recognition. The “grafting new meaning” line risks therapy-speak but is grounded by the physical act of unclasping the pendant. Both characters remain flawed, wary, and specific without veering into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The novelist’s internal conflict is vividly rendered through embodied sensations (chill vs. warm shell, dry clothes in water) and micro-choices (locking eyes to anchor fading figures). His transformation from blocked artist to “conduit” feels earned via repeated acts of solemnization. However, secondary characters exist only as symbolic vessels—their desires abstracted into hope-shapes—limiting relational depth. The resolution leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, softening the cost of his creative rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to restore ancestral sacred practices—is clear and emotionally grounded, with embodied gestures (tears, precise tinkering) that convey interior weight. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he moves steadily toward success without meaningful resistance or doubt. The vine tendril’s confirmation feels like external validation rather than earned struggle. His emotional arc is poignant but leans on reverence over tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation—translating heartbeats into navigable maps—is deeply rooted in generational duty and embodied through precise, tactile rituals. His patience isn’t abstract; it manifests in micro-choices (tweezers, listening, balanced meditation) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action: tenderness toward decay, discipline amid wonder. The final act of sealing the map forecloses no personal path but affirms continuity as endurance—a credible Earned Stasis with felt cost in legacy, not self.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—to preserve wonder against a barren future—is clear, consistent, and embodied through precise actions (e.g., mapping echo angles, calibrating crystals). His peripherally focused attention isn’t just stated but shapes his method and perception, revealing a hierarchy of values: patience over haste, resonance over noise. However, his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see competence without meaningful struggle or doubt that complicates choice. The final renunciation—accepting that healing leaves scars—is earned but lacks a visceral, on-page cost beyond thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to collect burdens—is compelling and consistent, rooted in her identity as a fractal weaver. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“shingled hush… pressing against her eardrums like physical weight”) rather than diagnostic labels. The calcification choice feels earned by prior obsession and mentor warning, with visible cost: permanent entrapment. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—calloused hands, tracing raindrops, the tension between grief and creation—and her micro-choices (carving while the kettle boils, signing only after cooling) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her contradictions feel lived: she builds to avoid dissolving, yet each cut reopens loss. The “hauntingly practical” ethos isn’t stated but enacted, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Final renunciation isn’t tidy; love persists *through* form, not despite it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between regret and resoluteness—is embodied with specificity (e.g., “brittle edges pressing into his skin”) and evolves through micro-choices like reciting borrowed memories. His ghost functions as a credible projection of his former self, not a metaphorical crutch. The final shift feels earned because it arises from accumulated pressure, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion stays tactile and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her grandfather’s sextant and a civil engineer’s functional creativity—is consistent and embodied through precise physical actions (redirecting water, tracing lines). Her internal contradiction between mourning the past and engineering hope manifests in stoic wonder, not therapy-speak. The final choice to repurpose decay into a “circuit of possibility” is earned by prior causality, with the cost being emotional labor masked as quiet determination. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure or a second character limits the crucible of relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied—his twitching fingers, fogged breath, and hesitant hum reveal decades of buried longing without therapy-speak. His micro-choice to enter the forecourt and later hum aloud feels earned by accumulated pressure, not epiphany. However, his transformation leans slightly toward unearned ease; the shift from avoidance to reconciliation occurs with minimal friction or contradictory impulse in-scene. The final renunciation-as-embrace lacks a visible tradeoff beyond emotional relief.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation shifts with psychological precision—from treasure hunter to truth archaeologist—and his internal contradiction (craving clarity while mourning the death of his life’s purpose) is embodied in tactile detail (“hand trailed in the cold water,” “heart beat with a slow, deliberate rhythm”). His final renunciation feels earned, not epiphanic, and the cost—abandoning a sustaining myth—is legible in the charged poise of the closing lines. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving forgotten knowledge—is consistent and embodied through tactile engagement with rope and fulgurite. His patience, tied to seed-collecting experience, credibly enables the slow decoding. The final renunciation isn’t dramatic but resonant: he accepts stewardship without possession. However, interior contradiction remains muted; his philosophical stance lacks friction against doubt or cost until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his grief-adjacent profession, tactile habits (handling the thread), and quiet observation reveal a layered psyche without diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choice to write the gardener’s obituary crystallizes his thematic stance: healing through integration, not erasure. The gardener, though minimally present, exerts pressure via absence and legacy, making Elias’s final act feel earned. No head-hopping or stock phrasing; contradictions (loneliness vs. presence) coexist organically.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in his desire to restore lost beauty, and his interiority—especially his trembling hands and whispered hypotheses—feels concrete and particular. His final choice to sacrifice the palace for rebirth is earned through years of tinkering and reflection. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves steadily toward renunciation without meaningful resistance. The absence of a second character simplifies relational stakes but keeps focus sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her dual inheritance—arsonist father, compassionate mother—and embodied through tactile actions (planting, handling the coin). Her internal conflict between legacy and purpose operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. However, the resolution leans slightly toward unearned epiphany (“scars could sing”) without sufficient micro-choice friction under active pressure. The final renunciation of shame feels earned, but the absence of a tangible setback or mistake softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s luminous skepticism and realistically imaginative nature create a compelling interior contradiction that drives his micro-choices—kneeling at the cherub, picking up the coin, touching the key—all of which embody his struggle between doubt and hope. His emotional arc feels earned, not summarized, and the final shift from skepticism to unfiltered light is grounded in tactile, sensory experience rather than abstract epiphany. The grandmother’s remembered voice acts as a consistent internal compass without over-explaining. However, the term “luminous skeptic” borders on label-speak early on, slightly flattening immediacy before the embodiment catches up.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sentimentalist’s interiority is vividly embodied—its trembling, aching heart, and conflicted joy/loss feel specific and non-diagnostic. Motivation (“share light without using fire”) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final choice—to integrate rather than destroy the gear—is earned through ancestral memory and present stakes. Its flaw (aversion to violence) directly shapes tactics and closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his grief is embodied in chisel strokes, ribbon handling, and attention to butterfly wings. His motivation to map collective sorrow feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., carving migration paths instead of names). However, the grandfather’s spectral presence risks tipping into diagnostic label-speak (“spectral mentorship wasn’t about technique; it was about purpose”), slightly flattening emotional ambiguity at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—incremental absolution for a past failure—is embodied with visceral specificity: the carved rake handle, the twelve-minute shame, the pendulum as judge. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion lives in tactile detail (“fingers brushing cold obsidian,” “ghost of his failure”). The final renunciation—stepping back into quiet peace—is earned through micro-choices (aligning the handle, pressing inscriptions) that carry visible cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. shame, precision vs. penance) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—discovering the “shape of intentions” that bind echoes—is consistent, embodied through meticulous actions (tweezers, lens, thread-handling), and deepened by his emotional warmth upon resolution. His blithe daytime persona contrasts meaningfully with nocturnal gravity, revealing layered interiority without diagnostic self-awareness. The micro-choice to prioritize Captain Foster’s thread demonstrates a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, his flaw remains abstract; no genuine struggle or blind spot complicates his competence, slightly softening the cost of his endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cartographer’s motivation is vividly rendered—“to seed innovation within a constraint”—and his grounded imagination shapes tangible choices. However, internal conflict remains abstract; we see no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. His emotional arc lacks embodied friction or cost, leaning on lyrical assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The final confidence feels unearned because no prior beat shows him wrestling with doubt or limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is vividly embodied and drives every action, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses his passive preservationist role with visible cost: the radio’s silence, the crystal’s dimming. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through tactile engagement (tracing unplayed notes, humming into dust). The final choice—writing new lyrics—feels earned by prior causality, not epiphany. However, his emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy; he moves cleanly from diligence to renewal without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to crystallize a fleeting emotion—is compelling and embodied through his trembling hands, ash-powdering ritual, and tactile engagement with the mask. His internal contradiction (charlatan vs. authentic artist) feels lived-in, not diagnostic. The story avoids therapy-speak; grief is rendered through porcelain shards and charcoal dust, not labels. However, his transformation lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path—his endurance is poignant but leans slightly toward passive acceptance rather than active renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sebastian’s interiority is richly rendered through concrete actions—wrapping charts in oilskin, aligning the cog with sewer-grate shadows—and his “rationally rebellious” nature manifests in micro-choices that foreclose safety for truth. His contradictions feel lived-in: he clings to reason yet dreams of cosmic clockwork, embodying both intellectual rigor and mythic longing. However, his emotional range stays narrowly calibrated; we see resolve but little visceral doubt or fear during rising floodwaters, flattening the cost of his endurance. The final renunciation—carrying truth upward while accepting isolation—is earned, though the absence of a second character limits relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is richly embodied—her “weathered fingers,” “expectant resignation,” and devotion to vanishing arts reveal a consistent, flawed character whose micro-choices (transcribing tunes, rehearsing in the library) reflect deep motive. Her contradiction—hope versus resignation—is active in scene, not summary. However, secondary students lack individuation; their transformation leans on collective gesture rather than specific choices under pressure, limiting relationship-as-crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—creating beauty from ruins through memory-laced cultivation—is consistent, embodied, and drives every action. Her internal conflict (bitterness vs. hope) manifests physically in the plant’s reactions, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Micro-choices during pruning and planting reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: emotional labor as agricultural technique. However, her flaw (susceptibility to despair) is resolved too cleanly; the story lacks a moment where her struggle genuinely jeopardizes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness is embodied in micro-choices—frightening off the merchant, softening his honesty for the girl—and drives both internal conflict and external action. His motivation to preserve wonder is credibly tied to tactile keepsakes (drone wing, lacquer box) rather than abstract idealism. The final act of giving away the box feels earned, not sentimental, because it costs him his last private comfort. His flaw never feels like a label; it actively constrains and shapes every interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his perception of houses as living entities feels character-specific, not conceptual. His micro-choices (repositioning objects) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to his obsession, and the final act carries quiet cost: he affirms his belief system at the expense of conventional proof. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail (violet scent, rattling windows). The only near-slip is slight over-articulation in the closing reflection, but it’s earned by prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his stone form immune to pressure but not memory—and his micro-choices (handling the ampoule, choosing his own reply method) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His “incisively kind” trait manifests in perception of fractures for understanding, not destruction, driving his final act. The motivation to “welcome nuance” is dramatized through tactile, telekinetic decisions under pressure, not summary. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied via environmental interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grim optimism and internal contradiction—daring versus despair—are embodied through tactile details (the chipped die, chalk proofs) and micro-choices (rolling dice mid-ascent, scrawling equations). His motivation stems credibly from a missed opportunity, and his arc culminates in earned transformation: the healed die mirrors his psychological resolution. However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from regret to freedom lacks friction in the final beat. No diagnostic label-speak, but the epiphany borders on over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—proving kindness lingers—is clear, consistent, and embodied through micro-choices like mending a stranger’s coat. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile sensations (warm pastry, moth-soft bristles). The final act of painting on the magnolia leaf crystallizes her endurance as Earned Stasis: she accepts impermanence but insists on witness. One minor slip: the “roadmap of sorrows” risks cliché, though it’s quickly redeemed by sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests in kneading dough, tracing vanished frescoes, and the tactile weight of flour. Her historically oriented mind directly informs her actions (baking initials, mourning art as kin), revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only limitation is that Kaelen functions more as expositional conduit than fully pressured counterpoint, slightly flattening relational crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clock maker’s motivation—rooted in a lifelong defiance of linear time—is consistent and intensifies credibly toward his final act. His interiority is vividly embodied (“bleak exhilaration shiver through him”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The contradiction between control (neat invention) and surrender (unraveling into void) charges the climax. However, his transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; the epiphany arrives as “slow, inevitable unfolding,” slightly flattening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, sweat despite chill—and their contradictory impulses (fear of death vs. need to confront it) drive key choices. Motivation stems coherently from resuscitation trauma and dream-dictionary guidance. The final act of embracing the dead self feels earned through escalating micro-choices. However, the advisor’s role borders on expository, slightly diluting the autonomy of the protagonist’s epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prophet is vividly rendered through embodied ritual and micro-choices—selecting fruit by tone, tuning broken branches into harps—but lacks internal contradiction or struggle. Motivation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is consistent yet untested by genuine resistance or flaw. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but the single-POV interiority remains coherent and specific. Final renunciation (endless composition as survival) is earned, though cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—driven by filial longing and cartographic intuition—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her internal conflict (duty vs. discovery) manifests through embodied choices: obsessive mapping, nightly climbs, trembling hands at the crack. The final act of playing the whistle is earned by prior pattern-decoding work. However, her emotional shift lacks micro-contradictions under peak stress; resolve feels slightly too clean for the high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s emotionally rational trait is credibly embodied in his measured actions and internal contradictions, especially during the confrontation with the station master. His motivation—to rescue truth—drives micro-choices like retrieving the letter and drawing parallels in his notebook. However, the final renunciation lacks a fully dramatized cost beyond abstract resolve; the physical struggle feels slightly schematic. Interiority remains consistent but borders on over-articulated self-awareness in peak beats (“truth would hurt… necessary”).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in generational legacy and personal loss, with micro-choices—like wedging notes into crevices—that reveal his hierarchy of values. His “stoically sensitive” demeanor manifests through embodied restraint (trembling hands, precise movements) rather than exposition. However, interior contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we see his devotion but not competing impulses that challenge it under pressure. The grandfather’s wedding memory informs but doesn’t complicate his present action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “tranquilly perceptive” nature drives micro-choices like heating the stamp or reindexing by engineering rather than chronology. His motivation to trace honest origins compels higher-stakes intellectual risk, and his emotional arc (from cataloger to truth-bearer) feels earned. However, the lack of embodied contradiction—no real struggle against his own assumptions—keeps this just shy of 9+. The final tremor in his fingers conveys cost without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s grief is embodied with precision—his trembling mind versus sure hands, the measured torment of polishing quartz to capture dream-fragments. His motivation (reconstructing Liora from dream shards) is consistent, irrational, and tragically compelling. The internal contradiction—descending into sorrow to ascend her memory—is active in every micro-choice. Final renunciation (accepting delusion as only logic left) is earned by relentless prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, obsession, and fractured identity pulse through tactile details like the geode and the wedding memory. His motivation (to map unlived lives) stems credibly from trauma, and his micro-choices (initiating scans, preparing for descent) reveal a hierarchy of values: potential over closure. However, his emotional state borders on diagnostic (“bleak exhilaration,” “unfiltered awakening”) without sufficient contradiction in-scene; we see obsession but not its competing impulses actively clashing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kai’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion (“frequency that resonated deep in their chest”) and micro-choices under pressure (overriding programming to follow instinct). However, motivation leans slightly abstract—“belonging” lacks concrete personal stakes or contradictions that would ground higher-risk decisions. The trait “perpetually surprised” appears as label rather than active constraint, limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied through tactile rituals (watch hand, driftwood) and his moral paralysis feels authentic. His contradictory impulses—manufacturing false memories to avoid confronting his own failure while yearning for redemption—are active in-scene. Mara’s presence exerts precise relational pressure, and her final line crystallizes their shared burden without melodrama. However, the brother’s suicide backstory, though pivotal, remains summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening Elias’s culpability.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Julian’s motivation—rooted in past failure and a belief in transformation over transaction—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile gestures (the drawer pull) and quiet dialogue. The final act of helping Mellor and remaining on the parapet demonstrates earned endurance with visible emotional cost. Flaws are integral, not ornamental, and his “uncommon thoughtfulness” directly enables the fragile breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—between her merrily melancholic facade and profound self-doubt—is embodied through precise physical details (trembling fingers, automatic kayak motions) and micro-choices (avoiding then using the compass). Her flaw (inability to trust celestial navigation post-tragedy) directly drives repeated failed attempts at the lighthouse route. The final choice—to follow the compass eastward—feels earned by prior causality, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his numbness, fear, and flickers of hope feel earned, not diagnostic. His contradictory impulses (seeking memory yet dreading it) operate simultaneously in scene, especially when he submerges despite trauma. The baseball functions as both emotional anchor and symbol of paradox, grounding his arc. However, the final epiphany edges close to abstraction (“empathy… reclaimed within himself”) without fully dramatizing the shift through new behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands versus paradoxical steadiness, her tactile communion with blossoms and memory—and her motivation (reforging a bond beyond death) intensifies credibly to compel metamorphosis. Her micro-choice to light the spices despite fear reveals a hierarchy of values with clear cost: loss of human form. The transformation feels earned through consistent traits (beast whisperer who listens, not changes), though the final endurance leans slightly toward idealized resolution rather than gritty trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s grief is embodied through tactile rituals (handprints, cracked saucer) rather than diagnostic labels, and her “willingly perplexed” stance reflects authentic contradiction. Her final renunciation—accepting that lost time transforms into choking beauty—is earned by the ritual’s failure to retrieve the past. However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction in the climax (“beauty that chokes the living”) without fully grounding the cost in a concrete, irreversible choice beyond internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifism, emotional embodiment (“gravitationally lighter when happiness filled her being”), and internal conflict during shadow work feel specific and consistent. Her final renunciation—choosing duty over personal transcendence—is earned and costly. However, her emotional shifts occasionally verge on abstract (“joy filled her heart”) rather than fully embodied under peak stress. The trait of lightness is evocative but underutilized as a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to grasp the “texture of transformation”—is vividly embodied in his actions and micro-choices (e.g., following the escaped bug, unearthing the box), avoiding abstract epiphany. His destitution contrasts with his generosity, creating interior tension without over-explanation. However, his “gift” of orchestrating coincidences remains underexplored as a flaw or limitation, reducing the cost of his accidental success. The final laugh and smile feel earned but lightly weighted against the grandiosity of his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motivation—loyalty versus truth—is credibly rooted in her sentinel identity and family heirloom, intensifying as she deciphers the sundial. Her “calmly inventive” trait manifests in embodied choices (aligning quill with sundial, accessing hidden panel) under pressure. Interior conflict is shown through micro-choices (pausing at the panel, clutching the quill) rather than summarized. However, her shift toward accepting revolution lacks a visible cost beyond moral ambiguity; no path is truly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The herder’s precognitive curse and isolation drive credible, embodied choices under pressure—especially her trembling placement of the final stone—but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; her motives shift cleanly from desperation to revelation without competing impulses in-scene. The mentor’s remembered line provides thematic weight but doesn’t complicate her present decision. Her flaws (overreliance on inherited knowledge, isolation) directly cause past failure and shape current tactics. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle, slightly undermining earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—“furiously tranquil,” trembling hands, quiet rage—but his motivation lacks a pivotal micro-choice that alters tactics under pressure. His decision to open the envelope feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, and no path is truly foreclosed with visible cost. The reflection on scars is compelling but leans toward thematic assertion over dramatized conflict. Still, emotional specificity and consistent voice elevate characterization beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias and Lyra are vividly rendered through embodied contradictions: Elias’s mechanical arm whirs like “a philosophical argument unresolved,” while Lyra’s voice is “brittle but resonant.” Their micro-choices—aligning the needle card, circling the sundial—reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. Voice distinction is sharp in dialogue, with Elias’s “velvet-covered blade” contrasting Lyra’s shattering-glass laugh. The mutual arrival at understanding feels earned, though Lyra’s interiority remains slightly less textured than Elias’s.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s fluid identity is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., selecting “helpful” traits when meeting Ms. Harrow) and contradictions—his poetic fragility versus pragmatic resilience—without diagnostic self-awareness. Maya’s introduction sharpens his arc via reciprocal pressure, not convenience. The molting trait risks abstraction but is grounded in tactile behavior (coffee tin handling, seed planting). Final renunciation of fixed identity earns stasis with visible cost: he rebuilds regardless of who he becomes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pianist’s motivation—“to surprise fate with an unplanned encore”—is compelling and consistent, rooted in a yearning that intensifies through embodied action (climbing, threading film, pressing hands to the clock). His “strategically creative” trait manifests in tangible choices with visible cost (effort, risk, emotional vulnerability). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; longing is rendered through tactile detail (“fingers lingered on the keys,” “heart pounding”). The final peace feels earned, not tidy, as it arises from active reconfiguration rather than passive resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in cultural preservation, and his interiority—especially the “luminous doubt”—is concrete and character-specific. His micro-choice to whisper “Unfinished” emerges credibly from dream-logic clues, revealing a hierarchy of values (memory over certainty). However, his emotional state remains slightly abstracted in peak moments (“dying star” metaphor borders on diagnostic), preventing full embodiment under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kenji’s interiority is richly embodied—his slow speech, tactile engagement with lace and bonsai, and cerulean regret feel character-specific, not diagnostic. His contradiction (patience vs. lack of courage) drives micro-choices: tracing lace, testing words to the breeze. The final renunciation (“I regret”) is earned through prior causality and carries emotional cost. No safety-hedging; his flaws directly shape his inaction and eventual partial reckoning.
