  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is character-particular and embodied through her professional lens: the neutron-star metaphor shapes how she perceives collapse and transformation. Her trajectory from control to acceptance is earned through concrete observation—photographing dust patterns daily, noticing the butterfly. The final renunciation (leaving dust on her palms) carries visible cost, foreclosing her prior impulse to preprocess and sterilize. Minor weakness: the mother's cancer and control issues are told rather than dramatized, slightly softening the inheritance arc.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's internal journey from seeking narrative meaning in survival to accepting "meaning...accumulated like condensation" is earned through concrete sensory engagement (frost patterns, canyon wall warmth). The "steadily adaptive" trait manifests in scarred hands that "still knew how to shape molten glass," showing endurance with cost. Minor weakness: the patron's mapping feels slightly convenient in hindsight rather than seeded with micro-choices that would have revealed Elena's blindness earlier. The final decision to testify and rebuild carries visible cost—returning to the city, facing investigators—and forecloses the retreat into canyon silence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices around the tuning fork and sensor setup show agency under pressure. The motivation to transform silence into music is embodied through her work with the conservatory plants and the prototype device. However, the capsizing backstory remains largely summarized rather than inflecting present perception with contradictory impulses, and Claire's character exists primarily to validate Marina's project rather than apply independent pressure. The final self-mapping choice feels slightly tidy rather than revealing a genuine internal contradiction forced by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Meridian's shift from "inadvertently stubborn" surface-returner to eternal keeper is earned through her recognition of the drowned's need and her spatial experiments with the lens fragments. Her realization ("how many had she failed?") drives the library transformation and embodies contradictory impulses—decades of habit versus immediate corrective action. The final renunciation of her former practice and acceptance of the threshold position carries visible cost (permanent isolation), though the interiority leans slightly toward thematic summary in the closing paragraph rather than embodied contradiction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her gently persistent trait operates consistently across the narrative. However, her interior life remains somewhat opaque—we see actions and external rationale but little embodied contradiction or vulnerability under pressure. The community members are largely undifferentiated; Old Petrov and Young Sasha function as mouthpieces rather than individuals with distinct stakes. The final gathering feels orchestrated rather than earned by prior micro-choices that reveal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is established (seeking where unused love goes), but her agency remains passive—she observes and facilitates rather than making choices under pressure. The elderly woman's grief is embodied through breathing patterns, yet the resolution feels unearned; Marina's declaration "It's not gone" arrives without prior struggle or contradiction. Internal conflict is minimal: Marina proceeds smoothly from question to answer without genuine cost or foreclosed options. The camera obscura work reads as therapeutic procedure rather than character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's motivation to understand time's texture is clear and drives her into the maze, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract contemplation rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive visions are described rather than dramatized as immediate sensory pressure that forces micro-choices. The final dissolution reads as passive acceptance without visible struggle or trade-off between competing impulses. No secondary characters present to test relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her embodied actions with the chains show character-particular movement. However, the final transformation relies heavily on telling ("Now you decide what freedom means") rather than dramatized internal contradiction. The soldier's instant conversion lacks earned resistance—his decision arrives too cleanly without visible cost to his prior stance or orders.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's synesthetic condition is inventively rendered through embodied perception ("heard the apples first—their preserved crimson a low hum"), and her work translating absences into hearing aids shows genuine craft. However, the cancer subplot and the choice to imprint her thumb into the silver component feel more thematic than motivated by prior causality—her decision-making around her illness lacks on-page friction or visible trade-offs. The final gesture carries symbolic weight but doesn't foreclose a live path with felt cost; we see her hammer strike but not what she sacrifices to finish this device before her cells "finish her."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is signaled early and her progression from thief to witness is tracked, but the interior work remains abstract. Key moments like "luminous disbelief washed through Mira's chest" rely on metaphoric labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to scatter the portraits feels declared more than earned through prior micro-choices that show her wrestling with conflicting impulses. The elderly woman's appearance provides external validation rather than forcing Mira to confront her own agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is specific and embodied through her glass-working choices, and her self-narration habit emerges organically from isolation. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous flight from judgment and need to perform for an invisible audience. However, the final choice to "keep drawing" feels more like continuation than transformation—there's no visible cost or foreclosed path at closure, weakening the earned-change requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is rooted in identity crisis and the trembling certainty that her life is fabricated, driving her to decode Sophie's messages. Her embodied fear—trembling hands, phobia acknowledgment—grounds emotion. However, the interior arc leans on therapeutic language at key moments ("vulnerability—admitting terror while acting anyway—that's the real power") that flattens crisis-level interiority. Carson's motives are functional but thin; his sudden emergence and backstory dump replace dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—obsession with the oracle's work versus the pull of her abandoned merchant life. The progression from discovery through isolation to understanding is earned through embodied micro-choices (pressing against the wall, marking the star's fade, taking up the stylus). Her final choice to continue the work reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (forsaking family, accepting darkness). Minor: the "mildly obsessed" framing slightly hedges what the actions demonstrate fully.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    J-7's interiority is consistently rendered through its precise, measured perception—counting iterations, registering patterns—creating a coherent robotic consciousness. The motivation to understand thought-origins drives the entire arc and evolves through the amalgamation of 341 loops into recognition. Internal contradiction appears in the "questioning" that broke J-7 originally versus its current "composure," though the tension could be sharper in the closure moment. The final choice to continue sweeping with new understanding demonstrates earned transformation, but the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her curiosity drives investigation, but her transformation feels rapid—going from months of silent doubt to confident confrontation in one conversation without visible struggle. Viktor's confession through tickets shows character-particular expression. Elena remains functional but thin. The final choice to "walk upstairs toward morning" reads more as collective resolution than individual cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her strategic withering plan shows calculated risk-taking with visible cost (three seasons of declining measurements, risk of dismissal). The marbles ground her interior life in concrete memory without therapeutic label-speak. Marcus functions adequately as witness and foil but remains lightly sketched. Minor deduction for the apprentice's relatively thin presence and the ease with which Elara's gambit succeeds—the Council's instant acceptance lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Renna's motivation to prove sideways time is clear and drives her secret work, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract scientific wonder rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to show Voss feels unmotivated—no visible cost or internal conflict dramatized on the page beyond "vulnerability creeping into her voice." Her characterization as "obliging" is told through narration ("she always obliged") rather than shown through a costly choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's interiority is concrete and the journey from musician to inheritor of silent language is legible. However, the "lately inspired" trait functions as a label rather than shaping on-page choices under pressure. The final decision to "disrupt everything" feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the character moves smoothly toward embrace without visible internal friction. The embodied moment of plunging hands into water works well, but peak beats lean on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("inspired by dreams," "lately dormant creativity") that dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior contradiction—trained to filter uncertainty yet haunted by having done exactly that—drives every choice. The embodied guilt ("swallowed...like a stone," fever loosening it) reads concrete and particular. The final decision to recalibrate sensors is earned by on-page confession and shows visible cost: accepting more false positives, less certainty. Minor slip: Eva remains slightly abstract despite the illustration anchoring her; the relationship could bear more pressure if Eva's voice or a specific memory contested Mira's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her "drowsy alertness" and the way she "maps conversations like an archaeologist maps strata" feel specific to her investigative drive. The recklessness is embodied through her thirty-hour wakefulness and tunnel descent, though the final choice (photographing, contacting authorities) reads more as procedural follow-through than a decision under contradictory pressure. Internal conflict is present in her skepticism versus the hook of "frantic consistency," but the ending shifts to thematic summation rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's interiority is consistent and her motivation coheres (witness without judgment), but her choices remain observational rather than pressured. The moment with the obsidian refuge feels enacted upon her rather than through her agency—she watches the swan refold itself and receives a vision, but makes no contradictory choice under strain. The final decision to place the swan on the shelf carries minimal visible cost; it reads as gentle curation rather than a foreclosed path. Embodiment is present but abstract ("grips reality loosely") without specific physical contradiction or mistake that compounds.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's professional gentleness is shown through action (settling cross-legged, reading room energy), and Mrs. Chen's motivation to reconnect with Diane is clear. However, the transformation in Diane feels abrupt—her shift from checking phone to emotional breakthrough lacks intermediate resistance or embodied contradiction. The final choice (Diane's tears and acceptance) arrives without visible internal conflict or cost that would elevate the change beyond convenience. Micro-choices that reveal Maya's professional limits or Diane's competing obligations are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's interior world is rendered through specific sensory attention ("fingertips that had learned to read texture like braille") and her choices show consistent purpose in archival work. However, she remains largely observational; no on-page pressure forces a difficult decision or visible cost. The final act of copying Caroline's words into the ledger feels like continuation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle are minimal—she has already accepted her post-human state without dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margaret's internal life is embodied through her craft metaphor (jazz transposition) and the settling irony feels specific to her character. The man's revelation provides external pressure, but Margaret's response stays largely cerebral—the walk to the window and final smile read as contemplative rather than dramatically torn. Her contradiction between seeking transformation and accidentally orchestrating it works thematically, but the peak beat (his revelation) doesn't force a high-cost micro-choice on the page; she receives information and reflects. The ending gesture toward "choose her words more carefully. Or maybe…" hedges rather than crystallizes a stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Micah's motivation is clear and consistent: he uses philosophical paradox to dissolve possession by challenging the entity's foundational assumptions. His method is embodied through concrete tools (loop pedal, white palette) and rhetorical probes that reflect practiced expertise. Elena's recovery feels earned by the accumulated rhetorical pressure rather than sudden reversal. Minor slip: the entity's curiosity and the mechanism of its "burrowing" remain somewhat abstract, preventing full 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is articulated clearly through the "conductor of unheard symphonies" desire, and the chronological homesickness provides concrete grounding. However, her creative process remains largely told rather than shown in micro-choices under pressure—she simply "writes faster now, racing the exhaustion" without dramatized struggle or contradiction. The grandmother memories anchor character history effectively, but Maya's present-tense interiority defaults to poetic summary ("the ache for her younger self") rather than embodied sensation. The final rest feels earned by exhaustion but not by a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and specific, especially in the realization that "she was the one darkening" rather than the viaduct. The motivation to find "the version of herself that made sense" drives her choices, and the final choice to stop retracing feels earned by the tablet's message and her accumulated exhaustion. However, the embodied emotion remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "hope corroding" lean toward metaphor rather than visceral sensation—and the peak beat where she "let herself fall upward" lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to combat emotional numbness is clear and her professional identity as a deaf music teacher is well-established, but her interior life remains largely expository rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The piece tells us she "recognized" numbness and "felt drawn" to the phonograph without showing competing impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation is summarized across weeks and seasons rather than dramatized in a single choice with visible cost. The backstory about her students occupies significant space but doesn't anchor to present micro-decisions that alter her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is coherent and her meticulous nature shows through action (checking the pigeon, planning documentation), but her interior life remains somewhat abstract. The decision to create parallel documentation feels more strategic than emotionally embodied—we don't see the weight of choosing completeness over refusal through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The integrity theme is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. Her calm throughout (practiced calm, hands steadied) lacks the embodied contradiction that would elevate this to high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's interiority reads as abstract philosophizing rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. His choice to "show me the deepest layer" lacks earned motivation—he moves from observer to participant via conceptual leap, not dramatized need. Elena's "passionate intensity bleeding through measured tone" is told rather than embodied in gesture or specific micro-choice. The rope functions as symbolic prop without constraining an on-page decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The violinist's motivation is clear and consistently executed through acoustically perceptive choices that shape her actions in the greenhouse. Her interiority shows purposeful contradiction—trained to hear what others miss, yet choosing to leave sounds unfinished rather than complete them. The embodied emotion in her final smile and the decision to place the bowl as "a question with no answer" demonstrate character-specific values with visible cost (foregoing traditional resolution). Minor deduction: the backstory about bonfire storytelling, while anchored to present perception, occupies substantial space (~15%) without altering a present micro-choice until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's motivation is embodied through her fingertip reading of emotional frequencies and her deliberate professional distance, creating a credible working contradiction. The client Thomas functions as necessary pressure but remains thin—his desperation is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices. Maren's final self-application of the blotter demonstrates cost, but her internal contradiction (caring genuinely while eroding her own authenticity) is told rather than shown colliding in a single scene moment. The piece avoids therapy-speak in peak beats and grounds emotion in the static-electricity mechanic, keeping interiority concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlena's decision to attend the stargazing event and her recognition of the dockworkers show character-specific choices, though her epiphany feels slightly rushed. The internal shift from "never thought to thank them properly" to launching a recognition program lacks sufficient internal contradiction or struggle. Theo's backstory about his father provides grounded motivation, but the partnership forms too smoothly without friction. The shame warming her cheeks is embodied, but the leap to "door opening" and programmatic action needs more causally-earned hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sculptor's interiority remains primarily declarative—longing is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivations are clear (seeking belonging), but internal conflict is thin; the search scenes demonstrate outward sympathy without genuine struggle or cost until the late realization. The discovery that the tag was always there gestures at self-deception but arrives as told insight rather than dramatized tension. Embodied emotion is sparse; crystalline tears and luminescent ache remain descriptive rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is concrete and sustained—she tracks temporal disruptions methodically through observation and finally acts on the cages. The pendant provides a physical constraint that embodies the time-sculpting stakes. Interior specificity is strong ("borrowed time she'd collected hummed in the air like trapped insects"), though the protagonist remains somewhat reactive until the cage-opening sequence. The final renunciation (releasing borrowed time as payment) earns closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marius's interior quest is specific and his mathematical lens colors perception throughout. The wife's ambiguous transformation is haunting, but the emotional progression feels conceptually scaffolded rather than lived—"She had simply become less present each day" tells more than it shows. The final insight about negative space arrives through metaphor rather than through a dramatized micro-choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is present (mourning vs. seeking proof) but remains abstract rather than forcing incompatible actions in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation to emerge from hiding is concretely embodied through her eleven months of survival tactics, the caching behavior, and the decision triggered by finding the boy. The interiority is specific—"the desperate calculation in his eyes"—and the final choice to reveal herself carries visible cost (leaving safety). Minor slip: the boy's reaction "didn't run" feels slightly thin for the stakes; a micro-choice showing his internal conflict would strengthen the mutual risk.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his internal conflict—control versus surrender—is embodied through physical action (cutting wires, hands shaking). However, the transformation feels too smooth; the text tells us "something had shifted" without dramatizing the resistant, contradictory impulses that would make the change credible under pressure. The circuitously sincere speech pattern is consistent but remains more tell than show—we're told he speaks this way rather than seeing it constrain a high-stakes choice. The final epiphany ("growth requires surrender") edges toward thesis statement rather than earned realization through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter's interiority is concrete and specific: four days without sleep, hands knowing "things her exhausted mind couldn't articulate," the brooch as "small weight like an anchor." The convergence choice feels earned through accumulated observation and the exchange ritual carries visible cost (the tremor of "trying to believe in ritual again"). Minor slip: the other survivors remain somewhat underdeveloped, though their presence serves the protagonist's arc. The final choice to stay awake "by choice" rather than exhaustion closes the internal contradiction with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and character-particular through most beats ("magnify everyday magic," the cave as her sanctuary), and her realization crystallizes through on-page perception rather than assertion. However, the pilgrim remains functional rather than dimensional—his desperate hope and rapture are told emotions with minimal embodied contradiction. The final stance shift ("smiling at the terrifying gift of genuine surprise") feels earned by her clairvoyant irony but arrives quickly; the cost of her seventeen-year certainty collapsing could press harder on the page. Internal conflict operates more as recognition than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maris's motivation to restore the archive is clear and sustained, though her internal conflict remains muted—she never wavers or doubts the work itself. Her reactively visionary trait constrains tactics (waiting for spray conditions), but the emotional stakes of exile are told rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The final choice to take the boat out herself shows agency, yet the cost feels minor; no established path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's baseline traits (meticulous, artistic, analytical) are established early and her choice to follow the arrows advances pressure. However, her interior remains somewhat generic through the journey—the trembling certainty is told more than shown through contradictory impulses. The grandmother's posthumous whisper provides motivation, but Mara's peak choice (reaching for grandmother's truth rather than "grand conspiracies") feels more asserted than earned by prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The renunciation of larger truths carries conceptual weight but minimal embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's arc from burned-out physician to engaged translator shows clear motivation, and her medical background embodied through "hand steady from years of surgery" grounds her character. The interiority carries diagnostic self-awareness ("courageously kind to her patients until kindness hollowed her bones") that trends toward therapy-speak, though it doesn't flatten peak beats. Internal contradiction appears weakly: her skepticism versus Amit's patterns, but the tension resolves too smoothly without genuine struggle—she moves from "sympathetic skeptic" to faithful transcriber without a visible cost that forecloses her prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vesper's motivation (discovering what happens after goodbye) is coherent and rooted in seventeen millennia of loss. The fragment provides embodied sensation ("began to burn," "thrummed with approval") that anchors her perceptual particularity. However, the internal contradiction never materializes in scene—she moves from tedium to hope without friction, and the final choice to step through feels inevitable rather than costly. No on-page renunciation or visible price forecloses a competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between her father's legacy and her own ethical stance is embodied well through the ink pot and her documented choice at 4 AM. The decision to help Pavel shows consistent character logic—she refuses forgery but finds a truthful path that honors both her father's letters about "spaces between right and wrong" and her own integrity. Pavel's desperation reads authentic, though his arc is thinner. Minor: Mira's embodied emotion could deepen in peak beats; her professional stance occasionally distances us from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stationer's motivation is clear—collecting temporal textures through lamp frequencies—and her invention of the child's history demonstrates consistent craft. However, her "earnestly studious nature" is told rather than shown through choices under pressure. The invented girl's story carries more embodied emotion than the stationer's own arc, and the final walk into the labyrinth feels passive rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. No meaningful internal contradiction drives her decisions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—uncovering erased histories—but interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. "She'd been discovering the texture of memories wasn't smooth but rough, contaminated with lies" reads as thesis rather than lived perception under pressure. The protagonist makes no meaningful on-page choices that foreclose a path with visible cost; she collects and climbs but never faces a trade-off. The ending crystallizes purpose but doesn't earn a change or renunciation through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's shift from skeptic to believer is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The interiority relies on abstract epiphany ("she suddenly understood") without embodied cost or competing desires at the moment of realization. Her twenty-year career and grandmother's influence are told as backstory without micro-choices that foreclose paths on the page. The final mixing of tears and laughter reads as performed emotion rather than contradictory impulses wrestling under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices across beats—translating developer proposals by day while encoding resistance messages at night. The foundation stone chip functions well as an embodied tether to motivation, shifting from anchor to seed. Interiority remains concrete through most beats ("Her hand trembled, sending a streak of yellow across the wrong star"), though the closing paragraph edges toward summary rather than lived contradiction. Marcus lacks sufficient on-page presence to fully test relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivations are clear and grounded in family legacy, with embodied interiority ("feeling the slope give way beneath her like history itself crumbling"). Her purposeful curiosity drives visible choices—planting beacons, placing the sand grain—and the final stance (walking away after preserving what she can) feels earned. Minor: the internal voice occasionally drifts toward elevated narration ("erasure," "cosmic time") that sits slightly above immediate experience, and the grandfather backstory, while purposeful, occupies substantial space without fully altering present tactics beyond the symbolic grain placement.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's dedication and sensory methodology are established early, but her interiority remains surface-level—we see practiced certainty and calm satisfaction without contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The repair sequence demonstrates competence but never tests her limits or forces a choice with visible cost. The "magnetic calm" at the end reads as a static trait rather than an earned state emerging from pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply completes a task and prepares for the next.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's intellectual curiosity is embodied through concrete actions—translating symbols, tracing condensation patterns, cross-referencing charts—but her decision arc remains observational until the final paragraph's resolve to venture onto the ice. The predecessor functions more as exposition than pressure. Interior voice is consistent and professional, though the peak realization ("They don't begin. They return.") edges toward epiphany without sufficient embodied cost to anchor the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell tuner remains cryptic but largely static—her "infinitely patient" trait is asserted in summary ("She had spent seven years once…") rather than tested on the page with visible cost. Interior life is thin: we see ritual action but no embodied contradiction or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. The change in townspeople (Marcus, baker's daughter) is told in brief snapshot rather than dramatized with felt stakes, so the protagonist's arc reads more as catalyst than as a character who forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her technical competence balanced with genuine stakes, but her internal conflict is thin—she has one moment of doubt ("instincts screamed at her to surface") immediately overridden without complication. Thalia remains a cipher; we see her urgent gestures but no contradictory impulses, rendering the preserved priestess more symbol than character. The vial-memory flood offers rich backstory but does not tilt Marina's present stance through micro-choices; it informs rather than pressures. Embodiment is adequate ("hands trembled," "chest ache") but leans toward stock gestures rather than character-particular reactions under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus demonstrates consistent interiority around inherited shame and the choice to speak despite his father's legacy. His embodied relationship to silence (forehead pressed to lattice, breathing the quiet) shows concrete emotional processing. However, the inciting event—watching the prisoners depart—remains oddly passive; his non-intervention feels explained rather than dramatized as a lived contradiction. The final shift toward trusting someone might listen reads as self-narrated insight rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life remains largely abstract—we see her "learn to grow miracles" but never witness a contradictory impulse or specific micro-choice under pressure that reveals her values. The ghost bride is more atmosphere than agent; her guidance is told rather than dramatized through choices that force Elara into visible trade-offs. Emotional progression is smooth and upward without credible friction: Elara moves from solitude to "mournful elation" without on-page struggle or renunciation that forecloses a path. The carved stone bead and alchemical fruits function as props rather than constraints that shape her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to restore the labyrinth is clear and her sleepwalking discovery creates an embodied contradiction, but her character arc unfolds largely through exposition rather than on-page choices under pressure. The council confrontation is summarized in a single paragraph, flattening what should be a high-stakes moment. Interior life relies on poetic assertion ("strange certainty humming in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final descent feels inevitable but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior contradiction between diaspora rootlessness and desire for continuity is embodied through her "purposeful wandering" underground—a specific behavioral signature that shapes her choices. The priest's arc from declarative dismissal to "cautious enchantment" feels clean, though his reversal could have been tested by a micro-choice that costs him something on the page. Mira's grandmother remains an orienting anchor rather than a lived presence, which is appropriate at this length. The final choice to return is earned by the accumulated sensory and conceptual work, though the cost (leaving again, but differently) is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's embodied choices under pressure are clear—kneeling to decode, photographing, transcribing—and her motivation to preserve surface mail is grounded in concrete memories and deliberate resistance. Internal conflict appears in her understanding of the "digital suicide pact" impulse, though her own stance remains static across the piece. The final act of writing tomorrow's codes carries visible cost (persistent risk, deliberate labor) but no on-page transformation or renunciation that forecloses a path, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior is concrete and specific—cultivating dismissal, tracking separate visits, watching her shadow synchronize. The decision to warn the guard captain feels earned by accumulated observation, though the final choice happens off-page ("In the morning, she would...") rather than in scene. Embodied contradiction appears when she giggles at her own question while strategically performing foolishness. Minor: the grandmother's aphorism reads slightly generic; the candle keeper Dren is present but inert.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Isla's motivation to reconcile is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("fury rising," "desperate hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The medium functions more as oracle than character with agency. The sister exists only through reported letters and condensation-writing, never testing Isla on the page. The final choice to "run toward reconciliation" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative—no dramatized renunciation of pride, fear, or competing need.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and her translator's instinct drives key choices. The relationship with the girl builds purposefully toward the final decision to help, though the morphine's effect on her perception could be more consistently embodied throughout. The "lotus-hearted ache" phrase in the pivotal moment edges toward metaphoric over-articulation but the micro-choice to share the coral and commit to translation work carries visible cost. Minor embodiment gaps in the middle section prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's internal journey from work-focused artist to rediscovering joy is embodied through concrete choices: she sets down equipment "with careful reverence," makes the decision to amplify rather than impose, and laughs at the absurdity—a sound she "hadn't heard from her own throat in months." The realization that "joy wasn't lost in the past" feels earned through her embodied engagement with the fresco and fog. Minor slip: the streaming-to-network moment risks convenience, though the viewer comments do provide pressure that validates her shift. The breath-holding metaphor ("she'd been holding her breath for months, maybe years") edges toward therapy-speak but is anchored in the physical space and action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("memories felt thin, like paint watered down too many times"), and her methodical-yet-playful approach influences her reactions. The nested awakening structure creates genuine uncertainty about her state, driving contradictory impulses. However, the final choice to "let herself fall backward into sleep, or forward into waking" lacks visible cost—she smiles and embraces ambiguity without foreclosing a path or paying a legible price for the shift from certainty-seeking restorer to uncertainty-embracing dreamer.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Malachi demonstrates contradictory impulses—charming rogue paired with genuine fear (tremor in hands)—and his motivations are clear, rooted in ideological commitment. However, the internal conflict operates mostly through narration rather than scene pressure; the greenhouse meeting feels more like staged exposition than genuine tension between character wants. The seven-year-old daughter anecdote from the older man does more emotional work than Malachi's own embodied stakes. Micro-choices under pressure are largely absent; Malachi proposes, explains, and succeeds without meaningful resistance that tests his commitment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's motivation is clear and sustained, but her arc is primarily contemplative rather than conflicted. The interiority leans abstract ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") and occasionally label-heavy. Mira's characterization as "shyly unstoppable" functions better when dramatized through action than when announced. The ending shift—from solitary work to collaboration—feels earned by the planting scene but lacks visible internal resistance or cost that would raise the stakes of this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's interior is consistently rendered through her careful reverence and systematic approach, and her work carries embodied weight. The foxglove regret functions as felt emotion rather than diagnostic label. However, the protagonist operates in relative isolation without meaningful relational friction, and the final emotional state—"purpose mixed with sorrow, like love directed toward ghosts"—leans toward articulated summary rather than enacted contradiction. The choice to fashion the new chime feels inevitable given her role rather than a difficult renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interior contradiction—needing isolation to prove the method versus betraying collaborative promises—drives the scene authentically. Her "carefully reckless heart" emerges through concrete choices: the deliberate handling of the ink well, the decision to share volumes that represent months of solitude. Kael's war between "hurt against hope, anger against fascination" is embodied in his shifting finger taps and the moment he pulls his notebook forward. The reconciliation feels earned by the prior causality of her necessary silence, though the ending's "infinite possibility" phrase edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to harmonize conflicting values is established early and drives her decisions, but her interior life remains generic—no contradictory impulses or embodied stress during the three-day restoration. The predecessor's message functions more as puzzle than character pressure. The ending grants understanding to the elders without showing them struggle with prior distrust, flattening what could be a charged moment of renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's journey from lies to truth is well-motivated, with the Mars meteorite and recording device serving as concrete anchors for her internal conflict. The balance ritual and dust-mote naming reveal character-specific coping mechanisms without therapy-speak. Yuki functions primarily as listener rather than applying independent pressure, which slightly limits relational crucible dynamics. The final confession feels earned by the recording's arrival, though the emotional progression could show more irrational layering during the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's interiority is specific and embodied ("featherly determination," grain-reading as inherited method), and her motivations trace clearly through the piece. The final choice to step through carries visible cost (leaving the logbook closed, not looking back). Minor slip: the thirty-six-hour maze ordeal is told rather than shown in bodily consequence, and the transformation it caused remains somewhat abstract despite the weight placed on it.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal state is established through her outsider position and spatial analysis method, but her agency remains largely observational until the final realization. The shift from seeking belonging to recognizing "we're not outsiders" arrives without a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—it's an epiphany granted by the plankton spectacle rather than earned through contradiction or sacrifice. Chen is sketched efficiently but serves primarily as kind witness rather than pressure source. Interiority leans toward abstract phrasing ("rhythm of belonging," "shadowseam wonder") where concrete embodiment would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calla's interiority is consistently filtered through her work and remains coherent. The "cheerful gloom" emotional register is embodied through specific contradiction—"a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes"—and her choices (planting seeds, promising to remember) track logically from her motivations. However, the final turn toward "bearing witness to disappearance was itself a kind of preservation" arrives without genuine internal conflict or visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no prior impulse is contradicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's analytical nature is established through concrete observation and micro-choices (calculating vectors, positioning the bishop), but her emotional stakes remain abstract. The "orchestrated serendipity" method reads more as authorial concept than lived contradiction—she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible cost for her control. Interior reflection dominates without embodied tension; the "lightly attentive gaze" becomes a superpower rather than a constraint. The ending renunciation (stepping back into shadow) lacks the weight of foreclosed desire.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to preserve memory crystallizes clearly when she decides to tattoo her body with moonstone dust. The "spontaneously anchored" moment provides embodied emotional texture. However, the protagonist operates in near-total solitude with no on-page pressure from another character testing her resolve, and the exile choice itself occurs off-page. Internal contradiction is present (dancer seeking stillness within motion) but remains more philosophical than dramatically urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Samuel's interiority is specific to his craft and carries consistent perceptual bias (reading light through glass, seeing "frozen liquid still dreaming of flow"). His motivation to preserve the atrium through documented beauty is concrete, though the final choice—presenting a portfolio—arrives without visible resistance or cost on the page. The developer's pause and wistful expression are told rather than dramatized, weakening the relational crucible. Internal contradiction is present (conventional work versus transcendent search) but does not complicate the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus carries adequate interiority through memory and scarred hands, but critical beats lean heavily on abstraction ("bargained innocence," "pain journals," "universal language") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The father's suicide is told entirely in retrospect, and Marcus's decision to continue firefighting arrives as summary epiphany rather than a present choice under pressure. The final act—placing the box and writing his entry—reads as symbolic closure without visible cost that forecloses a live option. Embodied emotion appears (tracing words, scarred fingers) but therapy-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("translation of his father's pain," "syntax of survival") flatten peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("equations in tidal patterns," "theorems in the arrangement of stars") that remain decorative rather than embodied. The core motivation—proving hope via parallel timelines—is told through exposition rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her "lucidly watchful" observation mode keeps her passive: she watches three versions of herself but makes no difficult trade-off on the page. The formula she derives feels like a summary of the premise rather than an earned insight from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation ("discover what walls dream about") is poetic but remains abstract until the diaries force a shift in understanding. Her interior access is strong—equipment clicks, breath catches, perceptual awareness cultivated over years—but the final choice to archive and honor the research feels more like acceptance than a pivot with visible cost. The flashback to Eleanor's writing and the grandfather's theories provides depth without hijacking present action, anchoring in the diaries she holds. No embodied contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the closure beat; the decision to gather and document is rational and aligned rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aina's motivation is consistently rooted in grief and the borrowed heartbeat concept, with concrete embodiment ("birds sometimes landed on her shoulders"). The secondary pulse provides a physical anchor for her vigil. However, the final transition from grief to hope feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—her understanding arrives as epiphany ("she understood") without a dramatized cost or conflicting impulse in the moment. The choice to continue tomorrow lacks visible friction or sacrifice that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mirena's interiority is concrete and particular—her clipboard ritual, her brother's death in Kordas's battles, her resolve to "show up again and again with gentle hands." The contradiction between her moral weight and her persistence drives credible choices. Threll and Kordas remain functional but thinner, serving as foils rather than fully embodied agents. The final turn ("a promise rooted in practice") is earned but rests primarily on Mirena's arc, limiting the felt cost of the ensemble moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus operates with clear, god-scaled motivation throughout—the "amoral" and "secretly sentimental" traits drive his choices with visible cost (seven countries bought, four watersheds murdered). Internal contradiction is embodied: hands shake at the dove's call sounding "like water... like everything he had destroyed." The final walk-away forecloses reconciliation with visible cost. Minor deduction: the sentimental claim is asserted early rather than purely earned through action, though the shaking hands and refusal to look back dramatize it sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celestine's motivation is clear and her interior state is embodied through her movements and breath work. However, her choices lack meaningful contradiction—she never wavers or doubts, moving through the night with perfect resolve. The final transformation ("no longer constrained by others' definitions") feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle; we see graceful performance but no genuine internal friction that would make her breakthrough costly. The chaste courtesan premise remains largely ornamental, serving more as backstory context than as a force that complicates her present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and tied to craft ("elegant swoops of script still wet"). The partner's off-stage accusations drive internal conflict, but Marcus's "uncommonly serene" state throughout weakens the contradictory impulses needed for higher scores. The drunk's transformation feels more dramatized than Marcus's own arc, which resolves through reflection rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but the therapeutic framing ("faith: that uncertainty could be a gift") edges toward label-speak at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sera's character is anchored through her profession ("esoteric realist") and embodied detail—handling moth wings, tying knots—with micro-choices (working in silence, packing slowly) that reveal her methodical temperament. Internal conflict is present but underdeveloped: her drive to witness overlapping endings is stated more than tested by competing impulses. The final descent forecloses nothing with visible cost; she simply moves on, limiting the earned-change effect. Embodied emotion is strong ("fingers stiff from tying countless knots"), but diagnostic phrasing like "someone needed to pause" edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistently embodied through her technical work and the physicality of reading rope braids. The guilt-to-restoration arc is earned through concrete actions rather than declaration. Internal contradiction appears subtly in the tension between running from loss and building toward permanence. Minor deduction: the forgiveness framing ("gradual thaw") edges toward summary in places where micro-choices could have shown the shift more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and sustained, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—"precisely playful" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "choice" to walk forward feels more like philosophical acceptance than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (lying down, letting rain fall) but the epiphany arrives through summary insight rather than lived struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistently rooted in her devotion to astronomical understanding, but her internal landscape remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The discovery sequence shows methodical observation, yet no meaningful internal contradiction complicates her choices—she moves from tile to translation to revelation without friction or cost to herself. The final gesture (pressing the tile to her forehead, packing it away) reads as symbolic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible emotional price. Interiority stays in summarized reverence ("exhausted but suffused with dusky harmony") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's role as "scheming pacifist" shows clear motivation—healing through strategic misdirection—but her internal contradictions remain mostly told rather than embodied in competing impulses during the scene. Marcus's transformation from calcified anger to weeping release follows a credible arc, yet the speed feels compressed; his resistance dissolves primarily through Elena's monologue rather than through on-page micro-choices that reveal shifting values. The "cellular memory" conceit functions more as thematic assertion than as a constraint forcing Elena to adapt her tactics when Marcus resists. Interiority leans toward therapeutic vocabulary ("energetic density," "calcified into identity") that flattens the specificity of his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliane's motivation is clear and her method consistent with her craft heritage. Her interior tracking through the capture sequence shows embodied emotion ("breath matched its rhythm perfectly now") and micro-choices that reveal values. The final act—burying the mirror at Gregor's grave—follows from her respect for boundaries and completes her arc with visible cost (effort, exposure to danger). Minor: Gregor remains a catalytic figure without sufficient on-page friction to test Eliane's commitment beyond technical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and well-embodied ("surprised by her own admission"), and her hierarchy of values—craft over family—drives her choices with visible regret. Lisel's resentment is earned and her manufactured eye with "hairline fractures" becomes a physical manifestation of neglect. The final choice to work together forecloses the old isolation with felt cost, though the renunciation could land harder. Minor slip: "endearingly feisty" reads label-only in its single appearance rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is vivid and consistent—her bewilderment evolving to comprehension reads as earned. The "grandfather's eyes" reveal at the end carries conceptual weight but feels slightly unmoored from prior causality; the leap from curator to self-inheriting ancestor is declared more than dramatized. Embodied contradiction is present (pursuing forbidden knowledge despite dismissals), though the bathroom breakthrough borders on convenient epiphany without sufficient on-page struggle. Minor penalty for the final-beat insight arriving as assertion rather than through a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's character traits—careful resourcefulness, years of study, mastery of gaps—are established early and shape her rescue tactics. Her interiority often leans on elevated linguistic abstractions rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The traveler's recursion hollowness is declared but not dramatized through micro-choices; his desire to remember/forget cycles remains conceptual. The students function as plot objects without agency or presence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Isla's motivation to recapture understanding is present but operates at such an abstract level that her choices feel pre-ordained rather than earned through conflict. The chimera twins remain conceptual rather than embodied—their shifting ages and uncertain existence flatten rather than complicate her drive. Interiority leans heavily on therapeutic abstraction ("unkindled solace," "narrative threads") without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final step into the garden reads as surrender to established pattern rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marin's trait-driven choices ("adaptable," "methodical") shape her approach to the archive door, and her motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" drives the closure action. However, interiority leans toward expository summary rather than embodied contradiction—"she understood with sudden clarity" tells the epiphany rather than dramatizing the cognitive friction. The final braiding action feels competent without visible struggle or cost that would foreclose a live path; we see patience and success but not the tension between want and obstacle that would elevate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapkeeper's interiority is concrete and embodied through her ripple-mark tattoos and decades of cave knowledge. Her motivation to restore harmony is clear and consistent, driving her descent and the conjuring action. The "hammered repose" at the end reads as earned endurance rather than decisive change, fitting the closure form. Minor slip: the energy beings remain abstract obstacles without adaptation or resistance that would test her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mera's motivation is clearly rooted in her retrocognitive trait and academic rejection, but her internal experience remains largely cerebral rather than embodied under pressure. The piece tells us she's "cursed" and shows her methodical research, yet the final choice to rekindle the beacon carries no visible internal conflict or cost—she simply proceeds because "the pattern demanded completion." The vision of a future at the end feels like an authorial gift rather than earned transformation, and the lack of competing impulses or micro-choices under doubt flattens what could be a charged moment of faith versus reason.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maris is characterized through consistent philosophical reflection and her measuring practice, showing clear embodied action ("her measuring cord pulled taut"). Internal conflict appears in her "preemptive nostalgia" and the tension between permanence and impermanence, though the interiority tilts toward abstract meditation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The dialogue exchange with Davin reveals stance but reads slightly thesis-like rather than goal-driven. The final choice to "simply stand and remember remembering" feels more like thematic closure than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal landscape is handled through her chant and "ambient awareness," but these remain largely label-only mechanisms rather than embodied contradictions. Her motivation to combat hopelessness is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under competing pressures. The commander's transformation feels convenien—glazed emptiness to wet-eyed recognition in one night—without visible internal friction or cost that would make the change credible. Mara's competence is unbalanced by genuine struggle; she executes her plan without meaningful obstacle or self-doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei's interiority is concrete and character-particular through her observation of the hermit crab and her tangential approach to understanding. The embodied emotion ("arms wrapped around her knees") and the internal contradiction between Mei's professional patience and interpersonal failure create authentic tension. The final choice—accepting Lin's departure as transition rather than abandonment—is earned through the scene's progression, though the epiphany arrives slightly too articulated ("I forgot that humans live in transitions too"). Minor deduction for the warmly observant trait functioning more as authorial label than constraining force in a specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lina's internal contradiction between childhood claustrophobia and her obsessive silence-collecting is well embodied through concrete actions—securing vine loops, uncorking the doll, limiting sensory exposure. Her motivation to climb during inversions feels earned by the bunker trauma and her mother's planted beanstalk. The final recognition that "openness and enclosure could coexist" lands as a character-particular insight rather than a generic epiphany, though the phrasing edges toward thematic summary. Minor issue: the father's bunker work and the "irony, her father called it" moment feel slightly tell-heavy, but the cost of her choice (carrying silence home versus remaining in the father's contracted world) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"seven years of watching people arrive shattered and leave slightly more whole"—with embodied motivation tied to the job. The young man's grief is shown through posture and breath rather than labels, and the brief exchange about his sister avoids over-articulation. The final gesture (palm on storm glass) reads as earned recognition. Minor: the piece leans heavily on reflective summary of Mara's experience; while BRR allows ~30% when anchored and choices are present, the ratio here edges close to exposition, though micro-choices (guiding, pointing, checking monitors) ground each reflective block in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vess's motivation is clear and her expertise is embodied through scanner glove and memory work, but her emotional arc remains abstract—tears at the mural lack setup, and the decision not to sit feels unmotivated. Internal contradiction is minimal; she proceeds linearly without genuine struggle between competing impulses. The renunciation at the end ("didn't sit") forecloses a path but the cost is told rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is rendered through concrete imagery (ash, scars, the doorknocker) and her choices show contradictory impulses—she sends Sienna away yet hands her the ring. However, the final turn toward teaching feels unmotivated; no on-page pressure compels Maya to reverse her three-year isolation beyond recognizing a mirror. The burn scars function as embodied history, but the shift from "you can't stay" to collaborative destruction lacks a dramatized internal cost that would justify abandoning her sanctuary ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's pyramid-scheme past and her choice to volunteer under pressure show clear motivation, and the interiority includes concrete embodied moments ("weathered hands," the bolt growing warm). However, the arc from mushroom farmer to threshold-keeper feels insufficiently earned—the internal conflict between her desire for redemption and the immense cosmic responsibility lacks dramatized hesitation or competing impulses in the moment of volunteering. The final transformation into a permanent anchor reads more like conceptual assertion than a choice with visible psychological cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her decision to end the dynasty shows character-particular motivation rooted in family history. The emotional progression during discovery feels earned, though the final "freed herself" realization edges toward epiphany without sufficient embodied struggle in the present moment. Internal contradiction is largely absent—she remains curious and methodical throughout without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The renunciation has cost (ending the bloodline) but it's backgrounded rather than foregrounded as a live choice under pressure in this room.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The knight's withdrawal and three-year isolation establish clear psychological stakes, and the moment she "swore them not to a person but to possibility itself" shows internal reorientation. The interiority leans abstract in places—"terror and ecstasy braided together" relies on stock pairing rather than character-particular embodiment. The final transformation lacks a meaningful contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path; she shifts from withdrawn to "extended into every pattern" without dramatized struggle against what that costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sarah's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile engagement with documents and dust. Her grief is particularized through "letters still folded in her pocket, growing soft with handling" and drives her methodical archival work as displacement activity. The choice to document the soldier's list is motivated and closes a path—she commits to this specific memorial labor rather than her own mourning. Minor deduction: the final paragraph's "her heart remained broken, but her hands were steady" edges toward label-speak, though the surrounding particulars anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her resourcefulness shapes key beats (collecting archives, finding the key, uploading transmissions). However, her internal experience remains thin—we see competence without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses under pressure. The ending choice (swimming away) feels procedurally clean rather than costly; she's already uploaded everything, so departure reads more like tactical withdrawal than a foreclosed path. The "tyranny of indifference" thesis is articulated directly rather than embodied in micro-choices that test competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her interiority is specific—musician's ears trained to catch overtones, the embodied act of playing pauses. The grandmother's voice surfacing from memory and Elena's childhood terror create effective internal contradiction. The final choice to maintain the hush is earned through on-page realization, though the shift from harbor performer to grotto keeper happens quickly. Minor slip: "eerie nostalgia" is named rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses during the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's seventeen-year sorting tenure establishes clear occupation and obsession, but the transformation moment ("she simply sat within her monument and transformed, becoming at last what she'd always been sorting toward") relies on abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction or visible cost. The "understanding bloomed within her like flowers from ash" reads as unearned epiphany without prior dramatized struggle between competing impulses. Motivation is signaled early and consistent, but the final change lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would demonstrate genuine internal conflict resolved with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ellis demonstrates clear character-particular perception through her trade and relationship to uncertainty, embodied in her choice to bring her full toolkit. The interiority around "uncertainly certain" is vivid and action-guiding. Motivation to preserve rather than solve the mystery emerges organically from her expertise. Minor deduction: Admiral Thornby remains somewhat abstract despite driving the plot; his presence lacks visceral contradiction or micro-choices that would elevate the characterization into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her agency drives the ritual, but her interiority leans heavily on metaphysical abstractions ("luminous regret," "molecular dance") rather than embodied contradiction. Kael's return feels convenient—his change is declared through metaphor ("golden lines traced his skin") without dramatizing what he lost or risked in the between-space. The apprentice relationship lacks friction before his disappearance; we're told she failed him but never see competing impulses during the original experiment. The ending epiphany about names as vessels arrives fully formed rather than emerging from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is well-anchored in her daughter's loss and embodied through her professional choices under pressure. The ghost's transformation from perpetual confession to remembered laughter shows earned micro-change through the protagonist's action. Internal contradiction appears briefly ("modestly fearless") but doesn't complicate choices in scene. The crocodile's tooth functions more as prop than constraint; Mara's use feels explanatory rather than wrestling with its implications under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's proprioceptive enhancements are embodied concretely ("sense the weight of each footfall before her boot touched ground"), and her internal contradiction—hating the precision her body has become—drives micro-choices throughout. The involuntary hand gesture and the decision to carve equations show agency under pressure. Minor deduction: the therapist's framing ("trauma responses, involuntary patterns") edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's quickly dramatized through physical action. The final acceptance ("no longer fighting what she'd become") is earned by the night's work and closes the arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to restore her grandmother's legacy is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads as smooth competence without embodied struggle. The nocturnal research sequence lacks physical cost or contradictory impulses—she works "through the night" without fatigue affecting perception or choice. The grandmother's erasure provides backstory weight, but Mira's present choices feel more like puzzle-solving than decisions that foreclose paths with visible internal friction. The final decision to present to the Guild carries stated stakes but no on-page wavering or trade-off that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation (discovering what ceilings hide) is established with backstory grounding, and his skillful observation drives key choices. The ghost's interiority is clear and her desperation embodied through gesture ("clutched something small against her chest with desperate fingers"). However, Marcus's emotional arc is flat—he moves from assessment to discovery to documentation without internal friction or visible cost. The final reflection "some repairs had nothing to do with cables" reads as unearned wisdom rather than dramatized realization through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Margritte's motivation (compress eternity into a moment) is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her decision to uncork the whisper lacks visible cost or trade-off; the library's transformation follows without her wrestling with consequences. Tessian's shift from "ruptures" to "wonder" happens too smoothly, without embodied conflict or a hierarchy of values tested on the page. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical declaration rather than character-particular perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Matthias's interiority is densely textured with contradictory impulses—revolutionary fervor cooled to scholarly obsession, the tension between wanting validation and protecting the vanished architects. His motivation to reimagine the civilization is embodied through concrete choices (covering mirrors, writing in verse, holding the shard during storms). However, the emotional progression feels somewhat abstract at peak moments; phrases like "burnished sorrow" and "frozen tear" label affect rather than ground it in bodily specifics. The final mirror moment attempts synthesis but edges toward symbolic convenience rather than earned contradiction acting in scene.

    Cornelius is motivated by his covenant and gift, with the affliction near dishonesty providing texture. However, his mastery is so complete—no genuine struggle, no moment where his fingers truly tremble or vision blurs under the work's pressure—that the restoration feels inevitable rather than earned. The seven boxes are processed mechanically without individual resistance or a single failure that costs him. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves through the night in unbroken competence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and specific—"patient attention to what objects whispered" establishes her perceptual mode early. The psychometry readings embody her way of knowing rather than remaining abstract labels. The final renunciation (leaving the compass) feels earned by her shift from commodification to preservation of mystery, with visible cost in forgoing collection. Minor: her uncle's thirst and her own seek-mystery arc run parallel without enough friction to create contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Iris's motivations are clear and consistent—finding "the one cut" that expresses flight or longing—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract artistic language rather than embodied contradiction. The slide revelation triggers contemplation rather than a difficult choice with visible cost; she studies, understands, and acts without meaningful internal resistance. The final sculpture decision feels like natural extension rather than a path foreclosed. Emotional progression is smooth and cerebral, lacking the irrational layering or flawed micro-choices that would earn higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's internal journey from vivid muralism to quiet work is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Her trait of being "quietly driven" remains label-only; we never see her work "through problems with her hands" in a way that creates genuine friction. The grandmother's postcards and Marina's motivation arrive as backstory conveniences rather than lived pressure. The final epiphany—"night-bloomers didn't reject light but required the specific, silvered quality"—reads as thesis statement rather than earned wisdom forged through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and particularized—"memory seized her like a fist" anchors the retrocognitive trap effectively. Her motivation deepens through embodied experience of Elijah's fear and determination, culminating in the earned shift from "solemn keeper of records" to "voice for encrypted voices." The transition from archival distance to active testimony is dramatized through her physical compulsion to arrange debris, creating visible cost. Minor slip: the epiphany language ("understood her motivation clearly now, burning like the desert sun") edges toward summary rather than staying fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's interiority leans abstract—"working memory," "concentrated potential"—rather than embodied contradictions. Her refusal of the wish is told via summary ("She knew better than to grasp at false comfort"), not a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost. The final smile and settled confidence lack internal friction; we don't see her wrestle with doubt or pay an immediate emotional price on the page, only witness a thesis statement clothed as character.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interiority is specific and rooted in her professional expertise, with embodied details like the wax shaving warming in her palm and the tactile memory of bark. However, the character arc moves primarily through reflection and mystical realization rather than contradictory impulses in scene—she experiences a cognitive shift ("understood then why she archived") but this arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized choices with competing costs. The final gesture of placing the shaving at the tree's base reads more as ritual completion than a choice that forecloses a path with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical action (prying the acorn cap, pressing palms against ice). Her decision to withdraw and "let the thieves have their stolen futures" feels motivated by the texture discovery but arrives somewhat abruptly—the internal calculus between restoration and earned work could be more contradictory in the moment of choice. The "furiously tranquil" attribute is declared twice but never dramatized as a visible constraint on action. Emotional progression from rage to acceptance reads clean but略 too smooth given the theft's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior is grounded in sensory detail (pressure through the rope, temperature shifts) and her curiosity drives concrete actions with cost—she bypasses automated sirens, risking her authority. The decision to use the bell instead of the mechanical alarm feels earned through prior observation and embodies her values. Minor deduction: "credibly curious" is labeled rather than fully dramatized through contradiction or mistake under pressure, and her competence never stumbles meaningfully before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's interior life is concrete and distinctly filtered through his spiritual curiosity, embodied in his empathic ritual with meteors. The backstory ("a marriage ended, a career abandoned") is compressed but tilts his present stance toward vulnerability as strength, delivering a credible shift by the ending when he sings back to the birds. Internal contradiction appears in his oscillation between self-imposed penance and discovery of meaning through imperfection, though the final renunciation of brokenness feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in a pivotal choice. Minor therapy-speak ("finding in each falling light a mirror of his own brief, burning journey") at the closure edge nudges the score down but does not break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is established through embodied isolation and micro-choices (placing the box, studying patterns, making a new box), with his motivation rooted in trauma from "voices became weapons." The ghost keeper is purposeful but remains a catalyst rather than a fully realized character with internal contradiction. The final choice to preserve the list is earned by the pattern of observation and understanding, though the emotional progression is somewhat linear without competing impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation ("to understand the texture of time passing") is declared but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The climactic discovery is handed to him via projection rather than earned through his agency; he remains a passive receiver. Interiority relies on poetic abstraction ("heartbeat underneath everything") rather than character-particular contradiction. The final stance feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority shows consistent particulars—collecting fragments, tending incompleteness—with embodied choices when she offers the feather and her notebook. The young man's grief-driven writer's block is stated cleanly but his shift toward acceptance feels slightly rapid; the laugh and agreement arrive without visible internal resistance. Both voices remain distinct in dialogue, though the young man's arc compresses several emotional stages into one conversation. Minor: his exhaustion is declared but not somatically tracked across the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina's arc from terminal diagnosis to purposeful caretaker is clearly motivated, and her "brazen calm" manifests in concrete actions—mapping, planting, documenting. Internal contradiction is present: she has "nothing to lose" yet builds a legacy for the next caretaker, revealing a simultaneous acceptance and denial of death. The final choice (peaceful death against a pillar) feels earned by her months of engagement. Minor deduction: the shift from self-focus to interspecies philosophy could show more embodied struggle; the insights arrive somewhat cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interior voice is distinct and her skepticism functions as both trait and lens, shown through her approach to the "experiment" of return. The emotional progression from cracked-open recognition to final understanding tracks cleanly. However, the climactic epiphany—"homecoming wasn't about place"—arrives as assertion rather than embodied realization, and the final convergence lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The amber becomes a passive talisman rather than forcing a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Erasmus shows consistent interiority through his methodical seed-planting and linguistic facility, but his choices never face meaningful opposition or cost. The work remains observational—he executes a plan without internal conflict or tradeoffs. Embodied detail is present (weathered hands, kneeling, scattering seeds) but the character never struggles or changes; he simply completes a task he's prepared for. No decisive shift or renunciation occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Finder's tracking skills and intuitive reading are embodied in her choices throughout, from decoding the cylinder to interpreting the preserved leaf. The reunion with Crow arrives with credible emotional weight, though the final turn toward hope feels slightly telescoped—the shift from "finding the dead" to "finding the living" lands as earned insight but compresses years of trauma into a single acknowledgment. Internal contradiction appears in Finder's simultaneous desire to forget and her inability to stop reading signs, which drives her journey west. Minor deduction for the autumn-leaf epiphany sequence, which edges toward convenient symbol-solving rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's interior life is concrete and specific—her choice to remain, the family custom grounding her, the shift from confusion to mapping as defiance. The motivation crystallizes on the page: "to turn confusion into exploration, to map what everyone else had abandoned as unmappable." Embodied contradictions are present (isolation as freedom, pariah as witness) and her renunciation of extraction is earned by prior setup. Minor: the passage "blessed by proximity to something incomprehensible, but marked as a pariah" reads slightly label-heavy, but the cost of her choice—timeline divergence, eternal solitude—lands visibly in the anniversary passage.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seren's motivation is clear and she makes micro-choices under pressure (which queen to swap, proceeding despite fear). However, her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—she trembles from "understanding" rather than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The mentor's absence and her apprentice status are told rather than dramatized through on-page struggle. The final transformation from apprentice to keeper feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a specific path.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's progression from crisis actor to archivist of small gestures is earned through concrete micro-choices: selecting survivors to interview, guiding their walks with "benevolent ruthlessness," documenting patterns in chalk. Her internal contradiction—cruelty as kindness—drives on-page action when she forces elderly survivors and traumatized children to repeat walks "until the muscle memory emerged pure." The colleague's visit crystallizes her shift from performing disasters to "performing the opposite," and her final stance forecloses pretense with visible cost. Minor issue: the phrase "glowed in her mind" leans toward stock interiority, but embodied choices anchor the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Isla's interior life is rendered through concrete, embodied imagery—mercury glass, texture-reading, the hollow ache—that avoids therapy-speak. The breakthrough moment where "buried talents rising like water from a forgotten well" carries genuine discovery, and her agency drives the resolution through choosing to write a tactile book. However, the emotional arc from pain to "precious" memories resolves too smoothly without visible ambivalence in the peak beat; the grandmother's stone delivery feels like convenient setup rather than earned complication. The final stance crystallization lacks a moment of genuine hesitation that would make the cost of choosing to stay and teach feel visceral rather than thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interior contradictions are embodied through her "fierce repose" physicality—pride that led to exile versus the capacity for self-forgiveness—and her fingers "fidgeting productively" signal both nervous energy and problem-solving focus. The final choice to forgive herself is earned through the tapestry's concrete progression and her voiced acknowledgment: "I was brilliant and cruel, and I have learned the difference." Minor weakness: the villagers' frozen regret functions more as atmospheric metaphor than individuated pressure on Elena's arc. Cost is visible—she remains exiled but achieves internal freedom—though the emotional journey leans slightly toward therapeutic self-awareness at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-specific—brush and paints abandoned, the decision to speak poetry as preparation—but the motivation feels more asserted than embodied. The internal shift at dawn ("understood") arrives as epiphany rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. Her renunciation of color and acceptance of judgment carries visible cost, though the choice to walk toward the spire lacks the micro-hesitation or contradictory impulse that would push this higher. The Minister's daughter remains off-page, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's self-narration habit and the grandmother's kintsugi philosophy provide clear motivation. Her uncertainty is embodied through trembling hands and the final choice to pour her own fog-grey doubt into the statue. The emotional arc from fear to acceptance of uncertainty as vessel is earned, though the protagonist's competence (matching essences to pockmarks) feels slightly frictionless given the high stakes. Internal contradiction between her wish for certainty and her grandmother's embrace of brokenness drives the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's internal arc is consistently rendered through embodied choice: the physical immersion in cold water is a concrete break from "intimately aloof" patterns. Her reflection on Thomas's letter and the promise to herself at nineteen shows contradictory impulses—fear of endings versus desire to live boldly—acting simultaneously. The final knock on the gallery owner's door earns its weight through the cave sequence, forecloses the observer stance with visible cost (ruined clothes, shattered mirror left unfixed). Minor slip: "intimately aloof" is told rather than shown in early beats, though later action dramatizes it well.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear—reconciling with Vera after seven years—and her internal conflict between "righteous anger" and buried tenderness is dramatized. However, the epiphany about "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness" tilts toward abstract label-speak rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The vial mechanism provides a concrete trigger, but the shift from fury to whispered apology feels more asserted than earned through on-page micro-choices that visibly cost her a defensive stance. Silas and Vera remain functionally present but underdrawn.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is present and consistent—salvaging, mapping, guiding—but her micro-choices remain generic and service-oriented rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final window moment ("pressed her forehead against the cold window") gestures toward internal conflict between her own loss and the work, yet the renunciation or stance shift is more asserted than dramatized through a concrete trade-off with visible cost. Emotional embodiment leans toward poetic abstraction ("geography of loss") rather than visceral specificity under pressure. Her daughter remains a tidy motivational token rather than a lived complication forcing harder choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied: her involuntary truthfulness constrains choice when the neighbor visits, forcing a confession that fractures grace. The glass-eye decision at the climax emerges from cumulative loneliness rather than epiphany, and the final stance—descending to help others—forecasts cost without hedging. Minor slip: the "rational mind catalogues risks" phrase edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's brief and followed by embodied action. The vulnerability/fracture opposition drives choices consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margit's interior life is specific and embodied—weathered fingers, her method of "observing gaps," her lighthouse-keeper pragmatism. The borrowed memories create authentic contradictions (Swedish grandmother vs. strudel memory) that she processes through action. Ernst's arc from technical success to recognizing memories as "ghosts" carries weight, though his final gesture is more explained than earned through on-page struggle. The closing choice to release the flower shows visible cost, but Margit's shift from burden to lightness arrives quickly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular ("ran his fingertips across the worn vellum...feeling the raised ink"), and his motivation accumulates across decades of waiting. The final choice to step through is earned by the grandfather's deathbed promise and the gradual confluence of signs. However, the internal conflict feels more sequential than simultaneous—he thinks of his shop, then his grandfather, then decides—rather than contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The closing line distinguishes "lonely" from "alone by choice," but the shift reads more as conceptual clarity than a visceral reversal with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's disenchantment is clearly established and her choice to climb away from courtly life is motivated. However, the internal contradiction feels stated rather than embodied—she "felt nothing but distant concern" reads as summary. The old woman's sudden appearance and the queen's acceptance lack visceral hesitation or doubt. The transformation from disenchantment to purpose in the final beat is declared but not earned through on-page micro-choices that show competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—the six pocket-suns—rather than mere reflection, and her choice to stay is earned by Kael's revelation and her own journey. Internal contradiction appears in her conflict between commercial success and original purpose, embodied in the difference between her capital work and the new spheres. The "scientifically romantic" attribute and some emotional passages ("the weight of being truly here") edge toward label-speak but remain anchored in her alchemical practice. Kael's blindness and the three-year separation provide genuine pressure, though his passivity as secondary character is appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is sharply embodied through concrete detail—"tasting copper and mountain air," the jealousy toward past selves, the "animal hunger" for innocence. Internal contradiction operates continuously: she chronicles to find pattern yet suspects documentation is futile; she craves her past self's linearity while accepting time's collapse. The choice to continue writing despite "jaded wonder" reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost—she remains shattered, continuing a task she knows may be pointless. Minor slip: the jealousy toward past selves and the feral nostalgia occasionally blur into summary rather than live contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's internal arc from mourning lost smell to recognizing her real gift (reading people) has clear motivation and embodied moments watching Mr. Chen work. The micro-choice to share her realization feels earned by the scene's causality. However, the epiphany arrives through therapeutic self-diagnosis ("I thought losing my smell meant losing my purpose") that edges into label-speak, and the childhood memory recognition feels convenient rather than grounded in prior interiority. The final stance crystallization has visible cost but the path there leans instructional.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("hands trembling," frost-crystallizing breath) that avoids label-speak. The arc from hiding scars to transforming them into a truth-rune is earned through prior causality (six years of study, the accident, Master Yerin's directive). Minor slip: the grandmother's superstition feels slightly convenient as a retrospective wisdom-delivery mechanism, though it does anchor a present micro-choice. The final renunciation of shame and acceptance of scars as stories forecloses a path with visible cost (exposure, vulnerability) scaled appropriately to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's internal conflict and guilt are embodied through specific actions (touching the perfume bottle, setting it down as offering) and her abandonment of metaphor marks genuine change. Derrick's wounded exhaustion and the choice to neither forgive nor fully reject show contradictory impulses in scene. The apology arrives with visible cost—fifteen years late, no guarantee of repair—and both characters' micro-choices (his withdrawal of the score, her physical offering) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: Derrick's exposition about sound and induced currents feels slightly over-articulated for natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority is heavily reflective rather than embodied—most emotional states are told through philosophical abstraction ("understanding at last," "grasped that unraveling wasn't destruction") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The motivation to unravel cosmic illusions remains declarative; no on-page micro-choice demonstrates a competing want or fear that complicates the drive. The final "smile" and dissolution read as unearned epiphany rather than a change driven by prior pressure. Agency is limited to walking and realizing, with no visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation to understand what clocks measure is clear and drives the story, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—the piece tells us she "suspected" rather than showing competing impulses in scene. The key insertion and backward counting feel like procedural steps rather than choices that embody conflict between fear and desire. The final shift ("understanding finally why shepherds guarded this station") reads as declared insight rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin; most interiority operates at a philosophical remove.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, especially when parsing her father's notebooks ("messages carved by a prisoner who was simultaneously his own jailer"). The internal contradiction—theoretical rebellion versus avoidance of confrontation—acts simultaneously in scene and drives her syllabus choice. The final decision to work equations together is earned by prior causality with visible cost (accepting he won't change, but choosing connection anyway). Minor: the father remains somewhat abstract; his post-stroke state is told more than shown, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iris is defined primarily through occupation and symbolic action rather than embodied interiority under pressure. The piece gestures at "cultivated estrangement as both art and service" but never dramatizes a micro-choice that reveals contradictory impulses—she moves through the routine without visible cost or friction. The woman and man callers are sketched through their confessional content, not through choices that alter tactics. No genuine internal conflict acts in scene; the protagonist executes her established method without obstacle or trade-off until the close.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between preservation-as-penance and preservation-as-celebration drives the arc. The "gently thorough" trait constrains her method but doesn't visibly cost her at the closure beat. Interiority is particular ("cathedral of the overlooked"), though the phrase "something between grief and exultation" at the opening reads slightly stock. The covenant transformation is earned by the locket's arrival and her embodied response at the jetty.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera's interiority is vivid and contradictory—"desperately jocular" manifests in embodied choices and voice modulation. The young man's arrival catalyzes genuine vulnerability, but his motivation arrives through dialogue exposition rather than embodied struggle. The final shift from masked performance to unmasked connection is earned, though the young man's naming of her loneliness ("shouting into a void") reads slightly convenient. Micro-choices under pressure (setting down the phone, picking up the moon rock) track cleanly with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interior grief is embodied through specific physical acts—kneeling, pressing palms, following the ring's pull—and her journey shows contradictory impulses (the drive to map grief versus accepting its unmappability). The wife's death three seasons ago anchors motivation, and the final choice to remain kneeling reflects earned acceptance with visible cost: she stops seeking escape. Minor slip: the shift from "determination to map her way through the unmappable" to discovering "there was no map" reads slightly over-articulated for peak realization, edging toward diagnostic clarity rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and her discovery of the pen's properties drives her to revise interpretations with visible consequence. The reflection-heavy middle section avoids label-speak and anchors in the pen and console work. However, her motivational arc lacks contradiction—she moves smoothly from guilt to "strange comfort" without dramatized internal friction. The settlers' polite gratitude is told rather than shown in a scene that would reveal her embodied reaction under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's transformation from mourning to creating is traced through embodied moments—tears on cheeks, fumbling gestures, body translating harbor rhythms. Internal contradiction appears when she simultaneously grieves her lost identity and discovers new purpose, though the epiphany feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph. Celeste functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying independent pressure; her "quietly charismatic" trait remains label-only without constraining choices. The camera-handling micro-choices are concrete, but the leap to "discovering" music lacks the messy, contradictory struggle that would make the transformation fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is established through backstory (Kiran's promise, the institutional erasure) but her present-scene choices—documenting, weeping, planning the upload—feel more procedural than contradictory under pressure. The vandalized portrait triggers grief, yet the scene lacks micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority relies on phrases like "volcanic tenderness" and "delayed grief" that label rather than embody. The final renunciation (becoming a permanent criminal) carries conceptual weight but the cost is declared more than dramatized through a present dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and her motivation—carrying thirteen lives—drives her return visits, but her choices lack genuine conflict or cost. The entangled memories provide texture yet never create contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; she moves through the garden in smooth contemplation without meaningful internal friction. The "quietly rebellious" trait is mentioned but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("her fingers ached") but the peak beats lean toward poetic summary rather than decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core motivation (proving whispers work) is clear and drives her deal with Voss, but her internal life feels thin—mostly told through backstory about her father rather than embodied contradiction in the present. The coin-flipping gesture and her "calculated spontaneity" walk are evocative, but she processes the high-stakes negotiation and labyrinth chase with little visceral stress or conflicting impulses. Her competence is established (seven years, knows every walk), yet the final revelation—that she's been seeding whispers for months to engineer this exact scenario—arrives as exposition rather than dramatized cost, flattening the sense that she's risking or losing something irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's guilt is embodied through concrete detail ("weight of words she couldn't release, a half-spoken secret lodged in her throat like a stone") and her confession is earned through the guardian's patient demonstration. The guardian remains symbolic rather than psychologically grounded—his silence is thematic but limits interior contradiction. The brother exists only as stake-object rather than relationship under pressure. Minor label-speak in peak beats ("stillwater tension" in the guardian's eyes) nudges the score down but does not break the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority operates through her "hearing unspoken words" trait, but this remains largely a tell-only device rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to counteract conformity is consistent, and the final moment where she replies "Why can't he?" shows a micro-choice, but internal conflict is absent—she never doubts her rebellion or pays a visible personal cost. The children's transformation feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is summarized or attributed via her listening power.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's internal landscape is embodied through her careful movement and the weight she carries, with concrete particulars like "kelp sliding against her calves." The key choice—releasing the scrimshaw—emerges from her prior restraint, though the epiphany moment ("I was never meant to be a weapon") edges toward explicit self-diagnosis. The dampeners provide interesting constraint, but the final transformation relies heavily on declarative realization rather than accumulated contradictory action. The grief and "tender rage" are felt, yet the closure leans on Marina telling herself what she's learned rather than the reader discovering it through irreconcilable behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's interiority is embodied through concrete gestures—the knife, the narration, the whittling rhythm—and her contradictory impulses (hanging the Mandate bouquet as "the only morally ambiguous choice available") act simultaneously rather than toggle. The self-narration functions as both defensive distance and a form of compulsive honoring of her brother, creating a character-specific coping mechanism. Minor: the phrase "learning slowly how to carry nothing at all" edges toward abstraction, but the prior physical work (whittling to translucence, the voice crack) earns the shift. Final choice to take down the bouquet and stop narrating is earned with visible cost (disintegration, silence).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyren's motivation is clear—she seeks aesthetic understanding forbidden under the ban—and her internal drive propels her through the colonnade. The piece maintains consistent interiority through concrete sensory anchors (humming, teeth aching, warm quartz). However, the final transformation feels more declared than earned through embodied contradiction; she "understood" and wrote, but the cost of this boundary-crossing remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized. The change registers intellectually but lacks the embodied tension or foreclosed path that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's trait of finding beauty in imperfection is consistently embodied through her actions with plants, paintings, and the reed tongue. The final choice to trade her vision for Fen's commitment arrives with visible cost (her "most prized possession" now shared). However, Fen's shift from "sleepwalking" to awakening feels somewhat abrupt; the moment he brings out the hidden vase lacks prior micro-choices showing internal resistance overcome. The interiority leans toward exposition ("Being colorblind had taught her...") rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Karim's shift from mourning the project's failure to recognizing "loss creates its own geography" shows clear internal contradiction dramatized through her interaction with the bell ringer. The embodied moment "Karim felt something shift inside her chest" is somewhat generic but recovers with the following introspection about isolation. The bell ringer's backstory about the removed bells earns their motivation, though "powerfully gentle" reads as label-only without visible tradeoff in action. The final choice to "rebuild this...as testimony" closes a clear arc from isolation to connection with visible cost (abandoning restoration for honoring corruption).

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's progression from shattered to salvaged is traced through concrete work, but her interior life runs diagnostically smooth—"quiet passion that burned without consuming" and "teaching withering to bloom" read as writerly thesis rather than embodied contradiction. The commission night yields careful craft sequences but no meaningful choice under pressure; she proceeds methodically without friction. Vincent's loss and the studio collapse anchor backstory, yet the present tense offers no competing pull or micro-decision that tests her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is specific and embodied through her measuring rituals and grandmother's journal. The confiding scene with Tobias provides clear motivation—documenting cultural pattern mutations—that drives her choices. Internal contradiction appears in her tension between scientific analysis and inherited mystery, though the stakes of her discovery feel more intellectual than viscerally personal. Minor deduction: her emotional stakes around what she'll "do with it" remain somewhat abstract rather than pressing a concrete life choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maressa's interiority is often concrete ("hands trembling," "tears streaming"), but crucial choices feel more contemplative than contested. The decision to leave without recording arrives abruptly after deep immersion; we see no on-page battle between historian duty and ethical restraint. The final renunciation is thematically clear but lacks embodied cost—no visible struggle in the moment of withdrawal from the console. Internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

    Maren's interior is vivid and specific—the river stone, her profession, her sustained observation of Lyssa across decades. Her motivation to document and her parallel understanding of why the work is "impotent" create layered interiority. However, the character remains observational; she makes no on-page choice that forecloses a path or alters tactics under pressure. The ending gesture (stone against glass) is poetic but does not constitute a meaningful cost or decision that changes her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her stakes are clear, but the breakthrough moment ("growth required shedding…") reads as therapeutic epiphany rather than earned through embodied contradiction. The chameleon observation provides external anchoring, yet the arc from passivity to agency unfolds through reflection more than on-page micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized ("fragile in her convictions") rather than shown in simultaneous contradictory impulses during the decisive writing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's arc from broken healer to renewed practitioner is embodied through micro-choices (pouring water for the ivy, placing palms on glass) and contradictory impulses (seeking closure while opening wounds). Her guilt over Mrs. Kowalski's death drives concrete actions and the scar examination provides physical grounding. The therapy-speak phrase "inadequacy, guilt, the terrible knowledge" in early reflection lowers what would otherwise be strong interiority, and the final realization feels slightly over-articulated, but the embodied cost (the scar, the displaced miracle) keeps motivation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's quest is clearly motivated (seeking unused love), but her interior life remains largely abstract. The interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("phantom weight of every emotion") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The final choice to release the love feels thematically appropriate but lacks visible cost—she weeps and smiles, but what path is foreclosed? The piece prioritizes atmosphere over character complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clear—she must free trapped creativity—but her choices feel pre-determined by cosmic alignment rather than internal conflict. The ability to "hear unspoken words" remains label-only; we never see her struggle with or pay a price for this trait beyond atmospheric suffering. Her grandmother's backstory anchors her legacy but doesn't create on-page tension between competing impulses. The final act of becoming "the doorway" reads as passive surrender rather than a wrenching decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guard exists in superposition and seeks to cultivate possibility—clear motivation rooted in her altered state. Interiority is present ("her motivation had become singular") but remains abstract; we see few micro-choices under competing pressures. The final smile and song feel asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or cost. Embodied emotion is thin; much is told through concept rather than lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is consistent and his internal world is richly externalized through the mechanical forest metaphor. The progression from fear of the dark iron trees to understanding them as protection mechanisms shows genuine discovery. However, the final transformation feels under-earned—three months of uncontrolled translocation resolved in a single grove-mapping session without visible struggle or cost. The insight that "wisdom wasn't found in the towers he'd built, but in the wilderness he'd forgotten to visit" arrives as epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority is anchored in seventeen years of caregiving and the mother-tether motif, with her journey embodied through physical walking and card-handling. The guides remain abstract wisdom-figures without distinct individual choices or pressures; their dialogue converges into a single shoreline cadence. The final acceptance ("carrying her seven stars") reads as earned from accumulated particulars, though the emotional progression through the stations feels more rhythmic than contradictory. Micro-choices at each station are present but lack visible friction or cost that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta's interiority is concrete and character-particular: her damaged hands, her listening, her choice to hum despite management. Her motivation evolves from seeking understanding to active remembering with visible cost ("she would remain, and she would sing"). The final renunciation—staying when others fled, placing the bolt, continuing to sing—forecloses the option of leaving with her answer and carries embodied weight. Internal contradiction is present (seeking healing yet choosing to stay in oppressive silence) and her micro-choices (humming, moving corridors, placing the bolt) reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's interior life is vivid and embodied through selective attention—her small hands grinding ink, her reverence for crumbling books—and the final renunciation (dissolution alongside the library) is earned by her centuries-long guardianship and the escalating collapse. The emotional logic of contentment at closure reads credible given her arc from guardian to witness to "unmaker of lies." Minor weakness: her contradictory impulses (preservation vs. destruction of the library itself) could press harder in scene; the shift from tending to releasing feels more stated than dramatized in micro-choices. No relationship crucible is present, which fits the solitary scope.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority is specific and embodied through the three-two tapping rhythm, and her choices trace a clear arc from misunderstanding to insight. The micro-choices—studying data, pulling up archives, assembling overlays—feel goal-driven and consistent with her professional expertise. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she assumes paths are disappearing when they're returning, a misbelief corrected by her own dramatized work. The final revelation is earned through on-page effort, though the emotional cost of this discovery remains oblique rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"awkwardly confident in her purpose even when that purpose felt like smoke between her fingers" embodies contradiction. Her choice to return tomorrow and gather others is earned by the evening's revelation. Micro-choices (walking barefoot, raising the opera glasses, entering the circle) reveal hierarchy of values. The rebellion's failure reframed as pause shows internal shift with cost: she commits to an uncertain path, prophet or fool.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies through the piece—from survivor to insurgent to "midwife" of a transformed future. Her internal contradiction (daughter who preserved vs. self who destroyed) is dramatized in the choice to unseal the embryo. However, the final "Yes" feels slightly under-earned; we see the question posed but little embodied hesitation or cost in the acceptance. The telepathy with plants remains mostly a convenience tool rather than a source of genuine struggle or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Layla's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—the freeze response, the palms-flat ritual, the pearl metaphor functioning as a micro-choice anchor. Internal conflict shows simultaneous impulses (wanting to be present while the body keeps score). The ending micro-choice to return to the cuttings after the helicopter trigger earns the stance without therapy-speak intruding at closure. Minor deduction: the "anchoring optimism in realism" phrase in the school-group passage leans slightly abstract for peak interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to understand her fragmented vision is clear and drives her choices in the library. The gathering and arranging of cards demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the epiphany arrives too easily—she moves from confusion to understanding without meaningful internal resistance or cost. The final acceptance of fragmentation as truth feels asserted rather than earned through struggle against her artistic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in the brother's death, with embodied emotion in "anger was a still lake" and the tracker's "consciously wild grace." Internal contradiction appears in the push-pull between hunting for understanding versus revenge. The final choice to pursue the target is earned, though the brother's death feels somewhat told rather than fully dramatized in its pressure on present decisions. Micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to study patterns, packing the bowl) reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's internal conflict between fear and legacy is signaled through embodied action—trembling hands, carrying the core for years—and the letter provokes a decision with visible cost. However, the arc from "bravely conflicted" to activation feels compressed; the seventeen-year wait dissolves too quickly once the letter arrives, and the final choice reads more as revelation than earned struggle. The "perpetual hesitation into crystallized purpose" is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice sequence that would show competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's shift from rejection to teaching is earned through her father's gesture with the weapon, creating a credible arc. Interiority is character-specific ("engraved quiet," the way she reads violence in shadows) and embodied through her work with the roses. The father's internal conflict is less developed but his final choice—kneeling to learn—feels motivated by the weight of accumulated observation. Minor weakness: the roses "leaning away" risks anthropomorphic convenience, though it serves the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior is vivid and embodied throughout—"fear crystallizing in her spine," the cool-headed temperament tested by desperation. Her motivation (saving her daughter from silence) drives every choice, and the closing cost is dramatized: she risks transliteration of her own emotions to capture the laugh. Minor slip: the daughter's voicelessness could have been seeded earlier to deepen the contradictory pull between fishing expertise and parental helplessness.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Adelaide's internal conflict between protecting legacy and seeking truth is clearly motivated and embodied through concrete actions (hanging up, climbing stairs, studying photographs). The "proof by contradiction" method provides a distinctive intellectual texture to her decision-making. However, the epiphany moment ("I was protecting a dead man's reputation instead of seeking actual truth") arrives somewhat cleanly without the messy contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. The final choice is earned but the path feels slightly too rational for the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is present—grief and guilt transformed into her restoration project—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to tattoo herself with amber-dust ink is dramatized, but the insight that she's "been speaking to ourselves all along" arrives as an epiphany rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting in scene. The piece withholds key facts (her mother kept her, raised her) solely to manufacture the late reveal, and the protagonist's agency at closure is more receptive than active.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Isla's motivation to find meaning is established, and the woman's grief reads genuine. However, the protagonist's interiority remains somewhat abstract—"meaning in the mess" and "lilac unease" are evocative but not grounded in specific bodily contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The closing realization "we're all learning to be daughters and mothers to each other now" lands as a declared epiphany rather than one earned through visible tradeoffs. The final choice to complete the mandala carries symbolic weight but lacks a foregrounded cost that would make the change feel lived rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vessa's interiority is concrete and embodied through her mechanical hands and retrocognitive gift. The choice to pocket the tessera demonstrates internal conflict between justice and mercy, though the motivation relies heavily on reflective exposition rather than real-time pressure. The final renunciation carries visible cost—she accepts the burden of hidden truth—but the emotional progression reads somewhat tidy given the complexity of the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's synesthetic perception and stage-ghost motivation are established, but her interior life operates more as a vehicle for thematic display than as contradictory impulses under pressure. The young man exists only as an object of her perception—his "despair tasted like ash"—never gaining agency or on-page presence to create relational friction. The final choice to "wait" for him tomorrow carries minimal felt cost because no live option was foreclosed; she was already bound to the building and seeking applause. Embodied emotion is present in her memory of "electric joy" and "blue-cold regret," but the peak beat (her song) remains largely abstract rather than rooted in a micro-choice that alters present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's skepticism and subsequent devotion to mapping the pathways shows clear progression, with her "affection warring with frustration" embodied in concrete action. The three-week work sequence demonstrates contradictory impulses—grief over Iris's condition versus scientific excitement—acting simultaneously. However, the final-paragraph warmth recognition ("Recognition. Love.") edges into label-speak at a pivotal beat, and the leap from static shock to comprehensive diagnostic tool compresses earned struggle into summary. Internal conflict is present but the cost of Maya's transformation remains more told than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is consistent—sensory mapping evolving into translator-interpreter—but her interior contradictions remain thin. The piece tells us she's "becoming something else" rather than dramatizing the friction between her scientific role and mystical function through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get floating and speaking but few contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to continue broadcasting lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is established through her work and moves from passive observation to active discovery. The choice to catalog buttons by feeling rather than logic is dramatized on the page, and her final public act follows from this insight. However, the pivotal realization ("the prophecy had been about healing") arrives with minimal internal resistance—she trembles but proceeds without visible cost or foreclosed path in the moment. The character arc reads competent but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Claire's interior life is handled with concrete particulars—the misreading of her handler's message, the methodical devotion to weather observation as disguised waiting. The protagonist's arc from hiding to re-engagement is traced through micro-choices (photographing the snow-code, composing the barometric response), though the final decision to leave feels more announced than fought through. Marcus arrives and the interiority shifts to dialogue summary; the earned-cost test weakens when the protagonist's internal contradiction is mostly resolved before the climactic conversation. The "unused courage…patient as snowfall" framing is poetic but edges toward label-speak at the closure beat rather than embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's arc from "spindrift serenity" and "ambient awareness" to philosophical discourse shows interiority, but the woman's transformation from desperation to lightness arrives too smoothly without visible internal resistance. Her epiphany ("I forgot to look at what she actually meant to say") feels stated rather than earned through embodied struggle. The coachman's backstory ("loss becoming acceptance, bitterness becoming wisdom") reads as summary rather than present contradiction, and his philosophical observations risk ventriloquism—wisdom dispensed rather than discovered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The potter's interiority is consistent and craft-centered, though her zen-mindedness is more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "understanding" arrives through observation rather than struggle—"she understood now with sharp gentleness"—which reads closer to epiphany than earned revelation. The motivation to understand why places resist change drives the journey but never faces a contradictory want or fear that would deepen agency. Embodied emotion is present ("she breathed slowly, centering herself") but remains calm throughout; no degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to "stop hiding" is declared but never dramatized through interior contradiction or embodied struggle. The grandmother's locksmith legacy provides a concrete anchor, but the metaphor (locks as puzzles, light as keys) remains abstract rather than constraining actual choices under pressure. The children are present but generic; their individual reactions and resistance are absent, flattening the relational crucible. Mira's final choice to illuminate the lighthouse feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority is present but operates at a single register throughout—contemplative, poetic—without meaningful internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The climactic choice to chart territory feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle; we witness her understanding but not the cost of renouncing escape. Micro-choices exist (walking past creatures, holding the sundial) but don't reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values with visible stakes. The reincarnation backstory anchors present stance adequately but the transformation from "brittle awakenings" to independence reads as declarative summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei Lin's interior life is specific and embodied—her cataloging system by "particular ache," her hands moving "with the certainty of someone who had finally recognized the shape of her own seeking." The final renunciation (teaching Jun to write his own letters) arises from her realization about release versus preservation and carries visible cost: abandoning her keeper role. Minor slip: Jun's emotional state after reading the letter again feels asserted rather than fully dramatized, and the transition from observer to participant could carry more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's goal (stop the tricksters' manipulation) is clear and her preparation sequence shows agency, but her interior life reads more functional than contradictory. The "cautiously hopeful" label appears without embodied tension—we're told she's hopeful but never see competing impulses (fear of failure, doubt about the math) act simultaneously in scene. The climax choice to initiate the sequence feels inevitable rather than a charged fork with visible cost; no path is foreclosed because no alternative was dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's claustrophobia is embodied through tight bands and throat constriction, and her prudent adventurousness is shown through waiting for the right season. The character demonstrates motivation (seeking the key) and makes choices under pressure (tracing the pattern despite fear). However, the final moment—reaching through impossible space—feels more plot-mechanical than psychologically earned; the claustrophobia resolves too cleanly without lasting cost or visible trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's prosopagnosia is established but her interior contradictions remain abstract—she "reads architecture of gesture" without showing us how this shapes an on-page choice under pressure. The motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is told rather than embodied through concrete micro-choices. The final understanding ("The killer hadn't worn a mask") arrives as epiphany without prior contradictory impulses that would earn it. Embodied emotion is minimal; much is label-driven ("methodical gaze," "hands shook") without the bodily specificity that would anchor her state.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—honoring her great-grandmother's legacy—but her journey feels too smooth. The "nervously confident" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost; she ascends, explains, proposes, and succeeds without meaningful internal contradiction or embodied doubt acting simultaneously in scene. Dr. Yoon's shift from flat refusal to collaboration happens in a single exchange without dramatized resistance, undercutting the earned-change requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maria's motivation is clear and her observational trait is consistent, but her internal conflict remains largely abstract—she processes the mystery through professional metaphor rather than embodied struggle. The decision to "bear witness" feels like a natural extension of her existing practice rather than a choice with visible cost. Her emotional progression from observant professionalism to "luminous disbelief" is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The hitchhiker remains a cipher, preventing relationship pressure from forming.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Luka's internal arc is well-earned: contradictory impulses (transcendence vs. transformation, territorial marking as control vs. commitment to staying) act simultaneously in scene. The parallels between father's highway robbery and his own fintech predation are dramatized through embodied action—handling the foreign bills, placing stones—rather than mere assertion. Minor deduction: the epiphany "transcendence wasn't the same as transformation" reads slightly diagnostic mid-beat, though it's quickly anchored by the fox encounter and stone-placing. The final renunciation (staying rather than fleeing to "the next venture") forecloses a path with visible cost: he abandons the COO exit strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to decode the inscriptions is clear, but her interior life remains fairly abstract—"healing tangible" and carrying nightmares are asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Kove's grief is more concrete, especially through the telegram beat, and his progression from guilt to shared burden reads earned. The final choice to collaborate feels motivated but lacks a visible cost that forecloses another path; the weight simply becomes "bearable" without showing what Mira or Kove surrender in exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and her guarded nature provides internal texture, but interiority remains largely declarative ("warlike serenity," "uncanny ability") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivotal moment of "unbending her defenses" is told as a general price rather than shown through specific micro-choices under pressure. The final act—using the seed—feels competent but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would make the choice genuinely difficult. Emotional states are mostly narrated rather than enacted through physical perception or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to navigate the post-Acceleration world is signaled early, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—"anxious elation" is told rather than embodied in competing impulses during key choices. The wheelchair and visions provide surface texture, but no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; she accepts Chen's invitation and joins the ritual without foregrounding a fear or reservation she must overcome. The Intersection members arrive as functional archetypes (eyeless woman, fused-hand man, prophetic child) without distinct voices or pressure on Mara's stance. The final commitment ("guide others through it") feels declarative rather than earned by a prior renunciation or mistake that compounds on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her "reckless idealist" trait shows in her willingness to try reversing the trade despite knowing the cost. Internal contradiction appears when she recognizes her naivety but immediately calculates whether another impossible feat is possible. The interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("dusky resolve," "controlled anguish") and Kael's sudden appearance with full knowledge feels under-motivated—we don't see how he learned the mechanics or tracked her down. The final choice to "try" and "be gentle with the impossible" lacks embodied cost in the moment; it reads as thematic summary rather than a dramatized forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus shows layered interiority through contradictory impulses—hiding behind expertise while craving meaning, protecting the woman's story while serving truth. His roadie past and public failure are efficiently anchored to present stakes via concrete cues (the grille cloth triggers memory; the PBS humiliation drives his retreat into facts). The final choice to tack the cloth above his certificates and "begin again" earns modest transformation through prior causality, though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulation rather than pure dramatization. Embodied emotion is strong in gestures like refusing eye contact and the tremor he hears in her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Asha's methodical patience and grief are embodied through concrete actions—planting seeds, translating tablets—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract reflection ("physics of transition," "sacred debt") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shift from grief to comprehension feels asserted through metaphysical realization rather than earned through a visible choice with foreclosed alternatives. Dalmar functions primarily as backstory catalyst rather than applying immediate relational pressure. The "kindly methodical" trait appears as label more than constraint that costs her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation to preserve wonder is established early and the titan-gear provides embodied physicality. However, her internal arc remains largely abstract—she "understands" and "feels" rather than makes difficult choices with visible trade-offs. The grandmother's voice and the scroll's wisdom arrive as given insights rather than being earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending gesture (descending with the scroll) reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular through her professional lens ("defied every protocol manual"). The final choice to crown herself feels motivated by the accumulated confessions, though the transformation from inspector to participant compresses quickly. Embodied emotion is present in the shell-handling and the "heartbeat of her hesitation," but the epiphany leans slightly toward assertion ("I forgot how to feel until I found proof that others did"). The renunciation of duty is earned with visible cost—she risks her professional standing by recommending preservation—though the self-crowning moment borders on wish-fulfillment without deeper internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her interior life shows embodied contradiction—the medication detail grounds her altered perception. The accordion functions as witness, and her brother's death drives consistent choices. However, the final epiphany ("her methodical chronicling had been leading her here all along") edges toward over-articulated insight, and the playing scene resolves internal conflict too smoothly without visible renunciation cost. The backstory block is substantial but anchored; it primes the closure without flattening present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to find the unspoken library is clear and her veil-concealed features hint at backstory stakes, but interiority remains largely abstract—"understanding bloomed" rather than embodied contradiction. The Librarian appears as a fog-condensed facilitator without meaningful pressure or resistance, functioning more as exposition conduit than opposing force. The watch is handled but doesn't drive a micro-choice under pressure; it's described more than used to narrow options. No visible cost forecloses a path: Elena simply ascends, finds the library, and begins documenting without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Iris's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("mulberry ache," "perforated destiny"), and her micro-choices under pressure (sketching the blueprint, refusing easy favor) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ferns function as a credible contradiction—she hears them but cannot always act on their simple needs—though the Director's line "The ferns say you're troubled" risks ventriloquism. Internal conflict between preservation instinct and Empire critique is embodied in her palm-pressing ritual and coffee-reading, avoiding therapy-speak. The final choice to propagate the design is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of "luxuries, unable to remember," meeting the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is specific and embodied through her dual craft and sensory method. Her motivation to "capture one last spark" drives her process with clear ritual and attention. The weaver remains an object rather than a second character, so relationship dynamics don't apply. Internal contradiction is light—Kael's competence and reverence create a stable stance without struggle or cost that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in the hairpin touch and the breath-catch recognition. The forgiveness backstory is told rather than dramatized, but her present choices—guiding the soul to the Pool, sharing the hairpin, choosing wisdom over vengeance—show contradictory impulses (caretaker duty vs. personal grief) acting simultaneously. The final choice to continue her work is earned by on-page pressure with visible cost (confronting the man who killed her daughter). Minor deduction: the three-hundred-cycles timeframe and the forgiveness achieved "decades ago" are asserted rather than shown affecting her present stance until the confrontation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's occupation and motives are established early, but her interiority remains thin—she serves primarily as a therapeutic catalyst rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Keegan's arc from professional veneer to "protected vulnerability" is visible, though the shift feels somewhat mechanical; the line "protected vulnerability, raw and real" tells rather than embodies. The mirror shard confrontation delivers a credible choice with cost (writing the failure paper), but the decision arrives through guided insight rather than internal friction. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally labeled ("his voice lost its professional veneer").

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Keiran's backwards-aging and teaching through withholding are consistently rendered, and Maia's desire to disappear from scrutiny is anchored in concrete detail. However, the core epiphany—understanding presence/absence—arrives through declarative teaching rather than embodied struggle; Maia makes no on-page micro-choice that tests her new stance. The final image shows her dropping a stone, but no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies the realization. Interiority remains abstract ("felt the sycamore hush deepen into something like peace") rather than contradictory and embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The harmonic stone skimmer possesses a consistent, calcified resolve and her choice to help the trapped pulse is motivated by centuries of reverent listening. However, her interior life leans heavily on summary ("She was historically reverent by nature and necessity") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final teaching moment—spreading consciousness through echoes—feels more like an expository transfer than a dramatized struggle with visible cost. The wandering pulse's arc is vivid, but the protagonist's own stakes and internal friction remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Teryn's motivation is clear and her internal state is conveyed through concrete action (strapping the keystone, climbing, mist walking). The grandmother's teachings provide embodied memory that informs present choices. Minor weakness: the final beat's self-aware epiphany ("she had become exactly the mage she'd always been") edges toward summary rather than fully dramatized realization, though the keystone press anchors it in gesture. The climb and placement sequence show genuine physical struggle that earns the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority shows clear motivation (discovering his mother's journals) and embodied emotion (throat tightening, trembling hands). However, the peak moment—seeing the "ribbon of gold-green-violet"—slides into convenient epiphany without sustained internal contradiction. The final decision to return to lamps feels declared rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses another path. Minor slip: "unsure if he'd discovered the color of sound or merely seen what grief wanted him to see" reads as tidy self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is coherent—she seeks purpose through translation of backwards prophecies—and her micro-choices (coin selection, frequency adjustment) are consistent with her established method. Interior texture is somewhat abstract ("quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization that she is a witness-translator feels slightly declared rather than earned through visible cost; her isolation is stated but not tested. No secondary character pressure constrains her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's grief is embodied through concrete actions—tracing atlas pages, naming monsters, pressing the blade—rather than diagnostic labels. The hollow place filling with "sharp-edged and solid" crystallized words shows contradictory impulses (emptiness and accumulation) acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of fear is earned through the naming ritual, with visible cost in carrying forward the pain. Minor weakness: the daughter remains more symbol than person, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistent and her lukewarm magic creates a clear constraint that shapes her method. The "brittle devotion" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she persists without visible internal conflict or cost to her belief system until success arrives. Her final stance (watching, timing, ensuring rhythm) reads as competent stewardship rather than a choice that forecloses a meaningful path. Embodied emotion is present but thin; the peak moment lacks physical struggle or mistake under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal life is present through her grandfather backstory and seventeen-year tenure, and her choice to document rather than restrict shows agency with cost (supervisor calls her insubordinate). However, her transformation feels under-dramatized: the pivot from dutiful warden to archivist-activist happens in a single paragraph of reflection without visible struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "precisely humane" attribute appears only as a label twice, never constraining an on-page choice with visible tradeoff. Embodied emotion is thin; we're told she "understood" and "thought about" rather than shown sensory degradation or contradictory physical pulls under the decision pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's internal conflict between logic and intuition is stated rather than embodied in contradictory choices under pressure. Her "secret sentimentality" is told through exposition (pressed flowers, mother's locket) rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized resistance; she simply acts on instinct and the solution appears. The protagonist observes more than she decides until the climactic flame moment, which resolves her seventeen-year struggle in a single beat without visible struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera's interior world is concrete and contradictory—her fingers seeking the parachute buckle as both escape and nervous habit, her body moving through practiced paths while doubt threatens pattern work. The micro-choices (releasing the buckle, deciding to teach rather than pronounce) carry visible cost and embody her struggle between authority and transparency. Internal conflict operates simultaneously rather than in alternating summary. Minor slip: the "crushing responsibility" and "watcher's burden" phrases edge toward declaration rather than fully embodied experience, though the tactile work and final renunciation recover the ground.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kenji's emotional numbness is consistently portrayed, but his arc from distance to feeling relies heavily on therapy-speak ("ego death," "dissolution therapy") that labels rather than embodies. The courtroom decision feels somewhat abrupt—the crack in his chest is noted but not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The clone remains underdeveloped as a presence, more concept than character, which limits the relational crucible. Internal voice is coherent but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("both real, both necessary") that flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is given clear motivation (restoring the household's voice after Emma's death) and his actions are embodied—yanking cords, conducting with sweeps, humming lullabies. Internal contradiction surfaces in "mournfully eager," which colors his resolve. The family members' responses (mother smiling, brother speaking) show change earned by Marcus's persistent effort. Minor slip: the brother's first words feel slightly on-the-nose thematically, nudging toward articulation rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's transformation is embodied through concrete detail (dirt under fingernails, fox-like movement on all fours), and her shift from feral to upright at the end carries visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in her struggle between civilized librarian and wild creature, though the initial forgetting of her name and dimension-shift lacks specific causal grounding. The final choice to stand and resume work feels somewhat predetermined rather than forced by competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract label-speak ("dimensional homesickness," "interiorizing exteriors") without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's transformation from hopeless to hopeful is dramatized through her successive-approximation insight, and her decision to plunge the crozier carries visible cost (betraying her master, abandoning the Royal Metallurgist destiny). However, the interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("stoically sensitive," "hope calcified into habit") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final epiphany arrives through reflective narration rather than concrete choice under pressure. The seventeen-year backstory anchors motivation but flattens present-moment urgency; the piece reads more as retrospective contemplation than live crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her micro-choices (adjusting the fragment, tuning differently, recording) drive the narrative forward. Her internal journey from "conventional wisdom" to discarding assumptions shows agency. However, the character lacks embodied contradiction or struggle—her discovery unfolds smoothly without genuine cost or resistance, and the epiphany arrives without dramatized obstacles that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus displays consistent motivation through three years of failure, and his determination to understand passenger patterns drives choices. However, interiority remains somewhat generic—"resiliently positive" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The hourglass observation ritual and radio work show character-specific behavior, but peak moments lack the messy ambivalence or internal friction that would elevate to high bands. Captain Reeves and the passengers exist primarily as objects of Marcus's mission rather than sources of interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority shows clear motivation (seeking connection to understand her brother's schizophrenia), but the brother's manifestation at the end feels more conceptual than earned through prior contradiction or micro-choices. The phrase "unsettling calm" appears in her notebook and final image, but her emotional arc relies on therapeutic framing ("discover the texture of connection") rather than embodied conflict. The closure choice—staying with the realistically imaginary brother—lands, but the cost (surrendering to illusion) is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Yael's interiority is concrete and particular ("balancedly curious by nature—drawn to mysteries but grounded in method"), and her decision to request surface assignment emerges from established values. The chain link functions well as an anchoring object that filters her reflection. However, the internal conflict remains mostly contemplative rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her choice feels determined from the start rather than fought through on the page. The conversation with Reeves advances understanding but doesn't create genuine friction or force a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's curiosity and protective instinct are established early and drive her actions throughout. However, her competence borders on magical—tracing pulses, accessing records, intuitively knowing the carnival location—without sufficient struggle or blind spots. The moment she realizes Elena is missing and in danger feels too convenient, undermining the earned quality of her choices. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves through the beats with professional certainty rather than genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent—returning to retrieve her sister's research—but her claustrophobia functions mostly as a told trait rather than a live contradiction that forces hard choices under pressure. The internal conflict between fear and loyalty is stated but never dramatizes Maya hesitating, altering tactics, or paying a visible cost for pushing through. The sister exists only in backstory; no on-page relationship pressure tests Maya's commitment. Embodied emotion is present in "throat close and vision narrow" but remains surface-level description rather than shaping micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation to "defragment himself" and seek wisdom is clear, and the heartbeat counting establishes a concrete behavioral anchor. However, the near-death experience itself remains abstract—we get exposition about "scattered pieces" but little dramatized internal contradiction during the observatory scene. The grandmother's appearance in the ink provides emotional weight, but Marcus's response is more receptive than conflicted; the final "stopped counting" moment reads as an epiphany granted rather than a choice earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maerith's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving Keshrin through texture-to-sound translation. Her copper veins and observer role are embodied traits, and her obsession drives the arc. The interiority is specific ("quietly articulate by nature"), though her emotional progression remains steady rather than contradictory; the final smile feels earned by prior causality but lacks a visible internal struggle or competing impulse in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's professional stance is established (cryptid researcher, botanical illustrator cover), and her agency drives key choices—pocketing the arrowhead, answering the phone, and deciding to "metamorphose" rather than report. Interior texture is present but slips into label-speak during emotional beats ("tears froze on her cheeks," "frostbitten hope"). The mother's phone call supplies backstory-as-revelation, shifting Elena's stance, but the final choice feels under-motivated given no prior signal that she carried bitterness herself or sought transformation for personal reasons.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and her decision to play despite the statues' warning shows agency under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("her hunger for a world where beauty wasn't scheduled and regulated") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to lead the orchard feels somewhat inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict; the locust shell functions more as symbolic cue than a moment of genuine struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivations are clear and rooted in his role as border-crossing mailman, with embodied micro-choices ("paused beneath an archway") reflecting professional caution. The exchange with Mira demonstrates relationship under pressure with status clarity. Internal contradiction appears lightly when Kael nervously carries the storm yet moves "respectfully rebellious," though this could deepen. The final gesture of continuing with seventeen more deliveries earns a credible Earned Stasis with visible cost (ongoing risk, exhaustion), but the emotional arc remains steady rather than internally conflicted throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carpenter's seven-year silence and interiority are clearly established, with embodied emotion ("a melody was rising from her chest like water from deep stone") anchoring the breakthrough moment. The character's motivation is coherent—restoring carousels as wordless translation—and the humming/singing marks a credible shift earned by the hidden space discovery. Minor deduction: the trait "quietly persistent" appears more as label than as dramatized tension; the work proceeds smoothly without visible struggle or competing impulses that would deepen internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Meridian's interior world is developed through her mapping obsession and the grandmother connection, but her choices feel contemplative rather than pressured. The "reawaken" moment reads as epiphany without embodied contradiction or cost—she arrives at understanding through observation, not struggle. The sanely-eccentric trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows how this particular eccentricity constrains or enables a choice. Interiority is specific (hyperbolic curves, translucent sheets) but the emotional stakes stay abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interior journey from grief to understanding is embodied through her ritual photography practice and micro-choices (choosing aureolin yellow, photographing the palette itself). The discovery of Iris's message in the palette feels earned by prior causality—six months of searching transformed into fluency. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: longing to recover Iris versus learning to see absence as presence. Minor slip: the final walk-away lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; the resolution feels more like acceptance than renunciation with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation (trapped composition, maternal guilt) is clear and her final realization is earned by the locksmith's orchestrated revelation. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("improbable longing," "enveloped secrets") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic epiphany "that creating something beautiful would mean I loved her less" feels therapy-speak diagnostic rather than discovered through scene pressure. Micro-choices are present (withdrawing the handkerchief, accepting the device's use) but remain illustrative of pre-stated fear rather than forcing new trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's curiosity and return motivate her journey, but her interior life remains surface-level—largely articulated through label-phrases like "chronically curious nature" rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The decision at seventeen (forget vs. remember) is told in retrospect without embodied conflict, and the present recovery feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final choice to document lacks visible cost; she "simply stood...whole again" reads as emotional arithmetic that resolves complexity into satisfaction without foreclosing a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miren's nervous backward walking and tea-reading provide embodied character beats, and her evolution from "twice exiled" to mentor carries visible weight. Kael's arc from defiant to "walking backwards nervously" shows earned transformation through concrete micro-choices (draining tea impatiently, then slowing). Internal contradiction appears in Miren's "combative tenderness" and her fierce yet gentle gestures. The final choice feels motivated, though Kael's interiority remains thinner than Miren's, limiting full dual-POV depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Esme's motives are clear and her pruner's craft anchors her perceptual filter, but internal contradiction is absent—she proceeds with patient competence from start to finish without genuine struggle or self-doubt. The work of "capturing essence" unfolds through contemplative observation rather than embodied conflict; when her hands cramp and knees ache, these physical costs arrive as afterthoughts rather than complications that force tactical adjustments. The final choice (planting the seed in thin-reality soil) feels like the natural continuation of her established method rather than a decision that forecloses another path with visible cost. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, closing eyes, standing) but serve choreography more than revealing a hierarchy of competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is richly embodied—trembling hands, accumulated silences pressing like "unfallen snow," the half-finished mask as physical manifestation of her brokenness. Her choice to "drive the needle deep" knowing it will free the boy but not grant peace shows genuine moral complexity without tidy resolution. The boy's contradiction (wanting voice over peace) adds pressure. Minor deduction: the brother's guilt and Mara's parallel brokenness feel slightly telegraphed rather than fully earned through prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's "methodically curious" nature is shown through her frame-by-frame comparison work, and her interior voice remains consistent throughout. The central choice—to recommend exposing the archaeological wound—emerges from her map-framing philosophy but feels more like thematic insight than a decision with visible cost or competing pressures. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves smoothly from observation to epiphany without the friction of genuine stakes testing her professional judgment or personal investment.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's interiority is grounded in embodied perception ("hands trembled inside the submersible's controls") and the piece establishes her relationship with death through concrete action rather than abstraction. Her shift from seeking mathematical permission to accepting witness-without-solving is earned through discovering Marsh's note. However, the final epiphany leans slightly toward articulation rather than dramatized contradiction—she processes the transformation cleanly rather than resisting it. The "borrowed" feeling and patient shadow establish internal conflict, but the resolution arrives without visible renunciation or competing impulse at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The balladeer's motivation is concrete—songs slip from memory, she finally finds a listener—and the decision to encode messages is earned by her prior discovery and the ghost's need. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she's seldom-heard yet skilled, and the marriage of art and algorithm reflects her dual nature. However, the protagonist's interiority leans toward summary ("she understood, then") rather than embodied contradiction in the peak encoding moment, and emotional progression is smooth without credible irrationality under pressure. The final choice feels inevitable but lacks a visible competing impulse that would charge the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (fitting goggles, reading entries). Internal experience is specific—"throat tightened" at memory, "affectionately detached from her own grief"—though the final phrase edges toward label-speak. The captain exists only in diary entries but applies pressure through Maren's discovery; her devotion and the choice to preserve what remains are earned. Minor: the phrase "affectionately detached" in the penultimate paragraph borders on diagnostic labeling but is redeemed by the concrete action of carrying diary and goggles.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is specific and embodied—"Grief, she wrote in her notebook, followed by the cloud's coordinates"—showing emotional state enacted through professional habit. The obsession with proving Victor's hypothesis drives concrete micro-choices (adjusting the telescope, cataloguing absences). Internal contradiction surfaces in her awareness that colleagues think she's mad while she remains convinced of her data, though this tension could deepen further with visible self-doubt affecting a tactical choice. The transformation from partner-supported researcher to solitary obsessive is earned across three months of off-page work, but the final satisfaction feels too tidy given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's prosopagnosia creates a coherent internal logic: she assembles features through measurement rather than recognition, driving her parallel understanding of the coin's fractally precise engravings. Her decision to photograph and pocket the coin, then commit to painting the custodian, shows agency under the story's constraint. However, the emotional arc remains largely contemplative rather than embodied—her interior feels more like philosophical meditation than lived contradiction. The final portrait commitment gestures toward change but the cost remains abstract; we don't see her wrestling with incompatible desires in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses visible in her simultaneous professional focus and awareness of her social isolation. The "diligently curious" trait drives her choices under pressure—she doesn't wait for permission before testing her theory. Embodied emotion is present ("clutched the phrasebook to her chest") and the final choice to chart everything reflects earned renunciation of the shared wonder moment. Minor slip: the captain's characterization leans functional, serving mainly as pressure-delivery rather than showing his own stakes in the stranding.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Celeste's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual language ("hollow," "wisdom," "wholeness") rather than embodied contradiction. The character never faces a genuine dilemma that forces competing impulses to act simultaneously; instead she moves smoothly from seeking to understanding without meaningful internal resistance. The epiphany in the mirror chamber arrives through external revelation (liquid starlight, materialized gears) rather than earned struggle, and the final "reverence" reads as declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The twenty-year backstory of "opening locks without understanding" is told rather than shown to constrain a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mirela's motivation to heal the fracturing community is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains thin—she "sensed" fracturing and "needed them to reexamine," yet we see no embodied contradiction or struggle in her choices. The shift from brief to longer messages lacks internal friction; her decision feels linear rather than conflicted. Secondary characters like Kess provide a glimpse of change under pressure, but Mirela's agency reads more as catalytic observation than a choice with personal cost. The ending gestures at relief ("I CAN REST NOW") but her stake in resting versus continuing was never dramatized as a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes clearly—to plant a lullaby that outlives time—and her action at closure (adjusting the clock inward, becoming part of the pattern) carries visible cost. The puppet head as externalized grief works concretely. However, the interiority leans abstract ("bruised awe," "functional enough to continue, broken enough to understand") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final choice feels more lyric inevitability than agency under pressure. The daughter exists only in backstory without present friction to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (hovering footfalls, guiding hikers). Her internal conflict between resentment and duty drives the core arc, culminating in acceptance with visible cost ("finally understanding what it meant to be chosen"). The aunt's character functions primarily as backstory setup rather than pressure in scene. Minor weakness: the hikers remain undifferentiated props without applying interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's interior is grounded in professional perception (polymer chemistry framing her observations) and the grief-to-agency arc is clear. The final choice to return to the lab emerges from accumulated observations rather than sudden insight, showing embodied thought. However, the epiphany moment leans toward articulation rather than dramatized contradiction—she understands "suddenly" without visible internal friction between competing impulses acting simultaneously in the scene. The renunciation of eighteen months of avoidance carries visible cost, but the shift feels more explained than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear and her profession shapes her perception throughout. The work of cataloging incisions provides concrete embodied action. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract interiority ("understanding what had been written first," "reorganized, redistributed the weight of memory") without fully dramatizing the contradictory impulses that would lift this into higher bands. The final choice to slip away feels more like completion of a task than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's gift and its curse are embodied through concrete action—touching, tasting, categorizing—and the wrapped hands signal a lived-in constraint. Her chef's discipline organizing memories by "dominant note, undertone, finish" feels character-specific and drives her choices throughout. The final departure carries weight, but the piece skates close to summary at key moments ("she began to sort") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in real time. Interior voice remains consistent, avoiding therapy-speak, and the ending forecloses a path with visible cost (the pavilion collapses, purpose served).

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's decision to address Elevator Seven directly shows agency under pressure, and her empathetic-decisive trait drives the key pivot. However, her interior life reads thinly—emotions are labeled ("eyes brimmed") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The supporting cast (Somali woman, Karen man, Tigrinya child) exist only as voices without individual motives, reducing them to instruments of Mira's project. The final moment lacks visible cost; success arrives without foreclosing a live option or forcing a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's "helix-minded" trait and engineering background are asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her final decision to "return these dreams to their owners" arrives without visible cost or a prior choice that forecloses another path; the transformation feels declared rather than earned. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("spiraling through code and consciousness simultaneously") and lacks embodied emotion under pressure. The piece tells us she is transformed but does not show competing impulses acting simultaneously at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celene's prism-minded trait is introduced purposefully and her motivation to plant the seeds is established early. However, the core agency moment—planting the seeds—reads as a foregone conclusion rather than a fraught choice with visible internal contradiction. The "prism-minded" descriptor remains largely a label; we don't see her holding multiple interpretations simultaneously during a pressured decision. Interiority leans toward exposition ("she'd been searching for three years") rather than embodied conflict in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her physicalized relationship with vibration and music. Her fingers bleeding on the wire demonstrates genuine cost and commitment. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective interior—"She understood what others had forgotten," "Mara understood that the Silence hadn't killed music"—that tells rather than dramatizes discovery through micro-choices under pressure. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany rather than earned realization from failed attempts or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Katrin's interior contradiction—needing to discover beauty in difficulty while wrestling with exile shame—manifests in the worry-stone dent and her melancholy hope. The chess-trained mind filters perception convincingly, and the final choice to smile through tears while planning to teach others shows earned growth with visible cost (she must now sustain the covenant, a living burden). Minor slip: the magnetic beings' curiosity and "geometric approval" read slightly anthropomorphized, blurring their alien quality. Embodied emotion is strong; the thumb-in-dent gesture and static electricity on skin ground the abstract stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcella's interiority shows specificity in her cataloging obsession and the frequency-based worldview, but her emotional progression reads too smooth—tears arrive on cue without embodied contradiction. The sister Elena remains a backstory construct whose humanitarian work is told rather than dramatized in present choices. The final epiphany about "courage to bear witness" feels awarded rather than earned through on-page friction, and the therapeutic clarity ("empathy doesn't require protection") flattens what could be contradictory grief.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirien's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is clearly stated but her interior journey relies heavily on summarized reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The three-year span is compressed into "each day she tended it," flattening the struggle into narrated endurance. The final transformation—"her relationship to it had fundamentally shifted"—is asserted rather than dramatized through a specific micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("hands tremble," "waves of nausea") but the climactic three-day vigil summarizes rather than shows moment-by-moment contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and her skill level established early, but her interiority remains mostly functional rather than contradictory. The discovery sequence shows competence without meaningful struggle—she flies well, finds the echo chamber, locates the orchard, and retrieves the canister with no genuine mistakes or cost-bearing decisions along the way. The final choice to confront the council is declared but not dramatized, so the character arc completes off-page. Embodied stress during the Turning is present but limited to physical sensations rather than psychological pressure that forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her professional training shapes perception effectively ("Everything speaks," he'd said, "if you know how to listen"). Her investigation choices are methodical and earned. However, the character arc leans explanatory—she arrives already competent, discovers evidence, and adapts her report without significant internal contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. The father's patch functions more as symbolic anchor than a catalyst for a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "certify wonder as essential" is established but remains abstract; the interiority leans on elevated descriptors ("synesthetically blessed mind," "prism-song bell ringer") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice—performing the ritual—arrives without visible conflict or cost that would foreclose another path; he simply executes a plan. Micro-choices are present (warming the bell, following the amber sheet) but they advance procedure rather than revealing competing values or genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior is well-rendered through embodied guilt and the Canyon's silence pressing on her choices. The flute's handling shows micro-choices under pressure, and the realization about natural entropy earns the shift from self-blame to acceptance. Internal contradiction appears in her tension between documenting failure and seeking restoration, though the final stance—witnessing "graceful collapse"—feels slightlyOver-articulated for peak emotional honesty. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's shifting personas are embodied through physical detail ("Prague engraver" precision, "Parisian lilt") and drive the central pressure—his fear that his own feelings are "incomplete." The confession to Mira ("Yes...I suspect mine is incomplete") lands with genuine vulnerability. However, the borrowed personalities function more as atmospheric texture than on-page constraint; we never see him forced to choose between a persona and his own impulse with visible cost. Mira remains observational rather than a secondary pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kessa's internal state is specific and embodied—trembling hands, nervousness that never fades—and the pendant touch becomes a micro-choice that alters her stance on the page. The mentor's absence shapes her motives and the herbalist conversation earns her realization that Orin "lives in these germinated moments." However, the final steadying feels slightly assured rather than contradictory; the progression from jittery to steady is clean but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her grief is embodied early (crushing grief, screamed at unfairness). However, the shift from skeptic-mystic to believer happens through passive observation rather than contradiction—she watches the prism warm and the frost speak without wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. The final stance ("finally firmly grounded") reads as summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("shifted hush," "truthful lies") without dramatizing the emotional friction those concepts create.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The loom spinner's interior life is established through concrete action (bleeding fingers, seven-day weaving) and embodied emotion (wistful hands, unshed tears). Her final sacrifice—giving "the essential warmth that had kept her breathing"—lands with weight. However, the motivation remains largely told rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene; the choice to sacrifice herself unfolds without visible internal resistance or competing desires that would deepen characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is consistent—quietly determined to rebuild—but his interior life is thin. The bartered memory mechanism creates interesting stakes, yet we see little contradictory impulse or embodied emotional struggle in the descent and striking sequence. The final collapse feels more like exhaustion than a choice with visible internal cost. The meekness trait is told more than shown through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaia's sensory mapping ability is rendered through specific, embodied perception ("coolness spread through her skull," "weight of silence"), and her final choice to learn rather than stay or seal passages shows genuine agency with visible cost—she accepts the burden of her mother's exile and the weight of truth. The mother's motivation is coherent and her backstory ("mapping the spaces between was illegal") provides clear stakes. Minor slip: the phrase "coordinates no computer could parse" leans toward stock description, and the mother's decades-long separation resolves quickly without more friction between abandonment and protection playing out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation to witness and respond is established through seventeen years of observation, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"warmly observant" is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final whispered acknowledgment "I see you" feels earned by her accumulated stone-stacking, yet the shift from silence to voice lacks a visible internal cost or friction. Her choice to continue visits is consistent but not tested by competing pressures on the page. The ghost-keeper remains a device rather than a relational crucible that would force harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is present but operates at a distance from genuine pressure. Her "accidentally prophetic" trait is mentioned twice (fish/squid, salvage captain) but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. The interiority relies heavily on stock lighthouse-keeper competence without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final logbook entry ("someone will understand what we're really doing here") gestures toward insight without dramatizing struggle or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dye master's shift from watchful observation to magnetic listener is clearly motivated by the donor heart, and her interior voice remains consistent throughout. The proprietor's revelation provides character history that enriches the protagonist's understanding, though the dye master's own active choices remain minimal—she primarily receives information rather than making decisions that foreclose paths. The morpho wing functions well as a teaching object that reflects her values, but the final "nodding" acceptance feels more like resignation than a choice with visible cost. The embodied details (careful fingers, rhythm in chest) ground the interiority effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior is concrete and selective—the opening perception ("silence that followed felt textured") and the wound-healing moment are well-embodied. However, her motivation to "deconstruct the measurement system" arrives almost entirely through the astronomer's notes rather than her own contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to map dreams feels inherited rather than earned by on-page struggle, and no visible cost forecloses a live path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to rekindle the realm is clear, but her fragmented state renders her more a symbolic vehicle than a character making choices under pressure. The dissolution at the end reads as predetermined by her nature rather than a decision with visible cost—she "felt herself growing thinner" passively. Internal contradiction is absent; she never hesitates or struggles against her fate. The embodied emotion and micro-choices that would earn higher bands are replaced by atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor's empathetic recluse identity is established but remains largely static; her three years of withdrawal is told rather than shown through lived contradiction. The ending choice to join the society feels too easy—no visible struggle between her established need for solitude and this new commitment. Mrs. Chen and the woman guide function as mechanisms rather than sources of pressure. The "compassionate recluse" reads more as a premise label than a lived contradiction driving micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's characterization is strong and consistent—her observational stance drives the narrative, and her complicity realization ("Her own complicity tasted bitter") carries weight. The old woman's arrival feels somewhat convenient, though her dialogue serves to externalize Mira's internal conflict effectively. Minor issue: the protagonist's micro-choices could bear more visible cost; planting is portrayed as resistance but never shown to foreclose other paths or exact a tangible price beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste's interiority is concrete and embodied through her archival work, with her transformation from preserver to transmitter earned by prior causality. Her motivations are clear—dedication to preservation evolving into acceptance of necessary transformation—and the final choice to release the capsule while staying behind carries visible cost. Internal contradiction operates through her simultaneous acceptance of death and commitment to continuity. Minor slip: the emotional progression feels slightly too smooth given the magnitude of choosing to die with the library.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Della's motivations are clear and intensify through the investigation; the hierarchy of values shows through her choices with Kern. Her decision to stop the recording and let him go carries visible cost and feels earned by her father's heirloom and the parallel father-daughter stakes. Minor slip: Kern's desperation feels slightly under-embodied in the confrontation—more gestural specificity would sharpen the moment. Internal contradiction between vengeance and mercy lands cleanly without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaia's skepticism is embodied through specific sensory experience (metallic taste, bioluminescent glow she resents) and her journey from demanding "mechanism" to accepting invitation shows clear progression. The final choice to offer the ring and say "Teach me" forecloses her skeptical stance with visible cost. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed—the shift from "embarrassed" resistance to "luminous acceptance" compresses what could be richer internal contradiction. The weather-carriers remain functional props rather than fully realized secondary presences that apply genuine interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete pressure—the stolen painting forces confrontation with buried grief. Interiority shows contradictory impulses: wanting to forget yet cataloging ten thousand faces, punishing herself through sidewalk art while longing for gallery space. The mnemonic gift is embodied in specific details (brother's scar, light in eyes) rather than merely labeled. Final choice feels earned by the docent's pressure and the letter's weight, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after fifteen years of paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's physical response to honesty/dishonesty provides embodied characterization (leaves drooping, unfurling), and her decision to take Kade and pursue the Archive shows agency under pressure. However, the core motivation—finding lost conversations—remains abstract rather than tied to a specific personal loss or concrete relational stake that would deepen internal contradiction. Kade's admission "I'm scared" shifts him from hollow brightness but his arc is underdeveloped; he functions primarily as witness. The transformation feels more conceptual than emotionally earned through layered contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains a choice on the page; her interiority consists largely of abstract reflection about truth and wonder rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece tells us she "knew" things were being lost and that bells were her "truest language," but we never see her wrestle with competing impulses or make a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final paragraph asserts transformation in the audience's faces without dramatizing resistance or cost in Mara's own stance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit-47's interiority is vividly embodied through sensors, cooling fans, and data corruption that manifests as "an ache." The arc from caretaker certainty to navigating chaos through containment shows clear motivation, and the final choice—planting new roses while humming a lullaby—feels earned by the android's teaching history with the child. Contradictory impulses (nostalgia versus mechanical function, the need for order versus acceptance of chaos) operate simultaneously in scene. Minor: the protagonist's struggle could show more genuine cost at the moment of choice rather than retrospective wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's professional eye and healing philosophy are established early, but her internal contradiction feels thin—she acts primarily as a compassionate facilitator rather than someone wrestling with competing impulses. The mother's silence backstory provides motivation but reads as exposition rather than embodied tension shaping present choices. Iris's grief is more bodily ("shoulders shaking," sinking to floor), yet her arc compresses months of avoidance into instant receptivity without visible resistance at the crucial turn. The courtyard gathering functions more as ambient support than a crucible that tests Maya's method against genuine failure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her skills are specific (lyrical code-breaking, dance-encryption), but her interior life remains abstract—vulnerability, hope, and defiance are catalogued rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The three-year captivity lacks embodied cost; no injury, fatigue, or micro-choice reveals genuine struggle. The final escape feels inevitable rather than earned by dramatic tension, and the calm defiance reads more as authorial theme than lived friction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, but her interior life relies heavily on summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The grandmother's dementia is told efficiently but remains abstract until the pressed-wildflowers moment. Her shift from observation to exhumation is earned, yet the final recovery feels smooth—no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or the cost of success. The work is strong but lacks the contradictory layering required for the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The summoner's motivation is clear and consistent, but her competence is almost frictionless—she completes her task without genuine struggle or internal contradiction. The work lacks embodied emotion; phrases like "tranquil blaze of focus" and "smoothed hush" feel abstract rather than viscerally felt. No meaningful cost forecloses a path; she simply succeeds and smiles, making the ending feel more like wish fulfillment than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is present and generally specific, with embodied moments like "cutting through the night" and the building desire to understand. However, the arc from comfortable curiosity to confrontation feels under-motivated; the narrator accepts Dr. Khoury's immortality claim with minimal dramatized resistance or internal contradiction. The final "Teach me" pivot arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path—no depicted struggle between skepticism and belief that would charge the choice. Minor: "agreed upon lies" as a phrase reads slightly meta rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's arc from "charmed skeptic" to breakthrough researcher carries clear motivation, and her sister's choice provides emotional weight. However, interiority leans abstract ("tragically radiant in their perfect stasis") and diagnostic ("stubborn refusal to accept isolation as an ending") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice feels more conceptual triumph than earned personal cost—we see intellectual discovery but minimal visible trade-off that forecloses a path with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lien's internal conflict is present—forge versus fidelity—but her turn from refusal to acceptance happens off-page ("as the stalactites dripped through the weeks, she reconsidered"). The completion choice itself feels inevitable rather than torn; no contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority stays at the level of philosophical reflection rather than visceral struggle. The master's teaching is told more than shown constraining her present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to understand her echo ability is present but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The discovery sequence proceeds smoothly without genuine internal conflict—she accepts her new identity as an "echo person" without dramatized resistance or cost. The final choice to "take her place among the echo people" reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the universe hummed its secret song") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her method is specific (mapping dream fragments), but her interiority remains largely abstract—she observes patterns without embodied emotion or visible internal contradiction. The captain's arc is told rather than dramatized; we never see the choice to drown with the data, only Maya's inference. The final promise ("I'll make sure they know") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path; Maya succeeds without struggle in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Chen's interior life is consistent and grounded in concrete practice—mending nets, studying shadow patterns, observing fireflies—with embodied patience. Her motivation to teach the girl is rooted in character (she sees hidden patterns everywhere) and the final beat returns to net-mending with quiet resolve. However, no on-page choice alters her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost; she prepares to teach tomorrow, but the story does not dramatize a moment where contradictory impulses act or a decision narrows options. The work reads as contemplation awaiting an event rather than a character under pressure making a choice that costs something now.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's progression from debunker to truth-suppressor shows clear internal conflict: her initial confidence ("Maya knew better than to trust comfortable lies") directly opposes her final choice to burn documents. The micro-choices during reconstruction ("her pulse quickened") and the deliberate document-burning sequence embody contradictory impulses under pressure. Vera's character is functional but underdeveloped; her suspicious greeting and tea-service feel staged. The climactic choice to protect the comfortable lie carries visible cost—Maya abandons her fifteen-year mission—but the decision compresses into summary ("she realized") rather than a dramatized struggle with competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and her choice to remain as vessel shows motivation, but the arc from loneliness to connection reads abstract rather than embodied. The transition "She no longer felt lonely, despite her isolation" tells rather than dramatizes the shift. Internal conflict is present in her position between factions, but the final smile and switch-off feel like closure gestures without visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interior beats use declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interior is vivid and particular—her motivation crystallizes through specific memory and sensory experience rather than declaration. The shift from "survival" penny poetry to purposeful preservation is earned through on-page discovery with the music box. Minor issue: the trajectory from isolation to community outreach resolves smoothly without visible internal resistance or cost that would deepen the renunciation of solitude. Embodied contradiction is present but could press harder at the choice point.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's engineering mindset is established early and her "logically emotional" trait appears twice, but the internal contradiction promised by that label never generates meaningful hesitation in scene—she moves smoothly from problem to solution without visible cost to her stance. Kael's transformation into ice is vivid, but his choice to "become part of what he'd tried to destroy" arrives as summary rather than dramatized struggle. The protagonist's climactic hum and harmonic engineering feel like competence deployed without genuine blind spots or mistakes that compound pressure before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is embodied through seventeen winters of mapping and her sister's death, creating a credible drive toward patient revolution. Her interiority remains concrete—"water beneath ice, powerful but controlled"—and her choices (timing the escape via magnetic windows, teaching restraint to her people) arise from established character logic. The crowd lacks individual differentiation beyond Kael, but at this length the collective functions adequately as secondary pressure. Minor slip: the sister's death is told rather than shown affecting a present micro-choice, though it does anchor the patience-over-passion stance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sara's investigator role motivates her choices throughout, with embodied emotion in the trembling hands and jaw-set moments. The inherited-memory conceit introduces contradictory impulses ("fragments that felt older, inherited"), but these never complicate her decision path—she processes them and moves forward without genuine internal conflict. The closure choice (submitting evidence) feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing goods; no visible cost appears beyond "worth the cost of liberation," which remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's guilt over the unfulfilled promise reads clearly through embodied detail ("throat tight," hands marked with "age spots and doubt"), and his final decision to act carries visible cost—confronting fifteen years of avoidance. The shop proprietor Mrs. Chen functions primarily as facilitator; her interiority is minimal but her connection to the prison world adds pressure. Internal conflict operates mostly in summary ("apologized to myself a hundred times") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The backstory chunk about Thomas Reilly and Sarah is substantial but anchored to the present object, staying within BRR limits; however, the resolution hinges on Marcus's off-page future action rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost visible on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Fennec's interior is well-textured ("Ridiculous...Absolutely idiotic that this works") and her pioneering background is integrated. However, the central choice—continuing to transliterate patterns—feels more like observed routine than a decision under pressure that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece tells us she's steadily curious and irreverent but shows no genuine internal conflict or contradiction acting in scene. The ending smile and journal-filling read as static observation rather than earned alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking digital traces of her brother through the archive. However, her internal life remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The final decision to write the extraction protocol feels inevitable given her role, but the moment lacks contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs that would complicate the choice. The brother's backstory anchors present action effectively without exceeding length allowances.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's interior is richly embodied through shadow-sense and perception, and her motivation to reconstitute peace through empathy is dramatized in choices (offering the fragment, directing attention to the children). The two leaders' interiorities are accessed cleanly via her shadow power without head-hopping. Minor deduction: the elders' emotional pivot feels slightly rapid given decades of feud, though the fragment mechanism earns some of the shift; embodied contradictory impulses are present but could be sharper in the climactic breath.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera's interior life is concrete and embodied—her relationship with the parasol shows contradictory impulses (cherishing/breaking, gripping/releasing) acting simultaneously. The shift from suicidal tourist to patient volunteer is earned through accumulative micro-choices (carrying the parasol, database work, boat rescue). Minor slip: the grandmother's observation "eyes of someone who has already crossed over" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's filtered through translation. The final choice to stay through summer feels motivated by prior causality with visible cost (appointment remains, but she defers).

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marco's internal voice carries some specificity (the grafting metaphor coherently rooted in his profession), and Elena's conflict between Dimitri and Marco is on the page. However, the decisive choice to stay feels underearned: Elena's burn-the-letter backstory is told rather than dramatized in a prior beat that would show her wrestling with the cost. The final "relief" laugh and sitting together read as summary rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority leans toward articulate self-awareness ("intersubjective understanding") that flattens urgency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation—to preserve walkers' knowledge—is clear and drives the sacrifice choice. Her "strangely honest" trait is stated but its constraining effect on tactics is thin. The final consecration choice carries visible cost (partial consciousness woven into stone), though the embodied struggle could deepen. Internal contradiction is present but muted; she moves toward sacrifice without significant competing impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her perceptive calm registers through action ("her hands knew the grammar of grief"), but her character lacks genuine internal conflict—she executes her process smoothly without contradiction or cost. The townspeople remain sketch-thin; Thomas's five-year badge wear feels like a visual shortcut rather than embodied psychology. The arc of collective movement from silence to planning unfolds too easily, with no visible friction between participants or resistance that Mira must navigate. Her final smile and thought of "the next town" tells rather than dramatizes any change or endurance on her part.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and particular ("weathered innocence—the knowledge that what she'd learned might shatter certainty, yet feeling almost childlike"), with embodied fear and wonder. Her five-year investigation and the choice to testify despite reticence show earned stakes. Minor deduction: her transformation from reticent to hours-long testimony is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page, and the final stance crystallization happens mostly in preparation rather than a decisive moment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and embodied through physical actions (touching sculptures, arranging driftwood, marking with chalk), and his precognitive forgetting creates genuine internal contradiction. Sarah's parallel grief over her mother's dementia provides strong relational pressure. The final choice—drawing a line as reminder rather than recording—feels earned, though Marcus's agency is somewhat diminished by his passive reliance on Sarah to hold his purpose. The relationship deepens under pressure and forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior life is grounded in embodied expertise—her grandmother's teaching method, forty years repairing cameras—and her actions flow from those particulars. The decision to honor what the clock is becoming rather than forcing it back shows genuine character agency tied to her craft philosophy. Minor weakness: Director Chen's "luminous ache" is stated rather than shown through behavior, though this doesn't touch the closure. The ending choice (dancing with forces rather than breaking free) emerges organically from the repair work dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's "decisively kind" quality is shown through concrete actions (seventeen calls, recording sessions, pressing vinyl into Linda's palm), but her interior life remains opaque—we see competence without meaningful internal friction or micro-hesitations that would reveal cost. Richard's motivation is clear and his reconciliation choice is earned, yet the swift resolution (one conversation, immediate "I'm sorry"/"I'm here") compresses what the setup promised as calcified fifteen-year silence. The lack of embodied contradictory impulses in the peak beat (the reunion itself is summarized as "They talked until sunset") and the therapeutic label "decisively kind" without on-page struggle lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority shows consistent scholarly caution and obsession with the shadow problem, and the final decision to "trace the final rune sequence" carries weight. However, the discovery that she is a shadow-self arrives late and is absorbed with surprising ease—no dramatized struggle between terror and acceptance, just "the quietly deliberate scholar warred with the terrified shadow-being" told in summary. The choice to merge feels pre-determined rather than wrestled from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. Embodied emotion remains thin at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's arc from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who embraces uncertainty is embodied through concrete choices—kneeling beside Thomas, tracing bone patterns, committing to help despite the impossibility. Internal contradiction appears when her "skepticism crack[s] open like an egg," and the embodied detail of her examining the constellation "like she'd examine an X-ray" grounds her professional lens. Thomas as changeling shows shrewdly innocent traits through both ancient sorrow and child-like grace, though his voice's "harmonics that made her teeth ache" leans slightly ornamental. The final choice to help both Thomases find home is earned by the constellation work, though Mrs. Weir remains a facilitator rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interiority is consistently rendered through the polishing ritual and embodied grief. The contradiction between earthbound yearning and light-sharing mission creates internal tension. Minor slip: the daughter's laughter memory arrives as a label ("bright as wind chimes") rather than a sensory reactivation that forces a present micro-choice. The final placement choice earns the stance but could show more cost in the gesture itself.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's "watchful dreamer" stance is established early and her micro-choices (gesturing to the bench, offering the pendant, explaining its meaning) are consistent with her role as sanctuary-keeper. However, her interiority remains somewhat generic—"hatred is just another kind of algorithm" feels like thematic statement rather than embodied thought under pressure. The executive's arc from armored confession to steadier hands is dramatized but rushes through emotional terrain that would realistically require more friction. Internal contradiction is present (Mira admitting "I used to" hate) but not deeply explored in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The novelist's interior life is embodied through concrete gestures (the seashell fragment pressed between palm and page) and contradictory impulses around grief, writing, and her daughter's death. Her realization—that the sister has been refracted through strangers—feels earned by the stranger's arrival and advice, though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization. The micro-choice to begin writing the final chapter carries visible cost (acceptance of fragmentation over reunion), scaled appropriately to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maera's craft and motivation are established early, with embodied detail (hands trailing bark, winding tendrils). Internal experience shows genuine commitment—she sings despite her cracked voice—but the stakes feel abstract; her struggle is technical (finding the right songs) rather than marked by internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path. The grandmother's "spins golden stories" reflection arrives as label-explanation rather than dramatized tension. Agency at closure is present but the choice feels preordained by the setup, with no competing impulse acting simultaneously to earn the final renunciation or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear—translating her daughter's heartbeats into a map—but her interior life remains abstract andLabel-heavy ("patience made physical"). The flashback to the daughter's death is efficiently deployed, yet the protagonist's emotional progression flattens into poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The final decision to "begin the journey" tomorrow arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative; the choice feels inevitable rather than agonized. Micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's motivation is clear—she seeks to understand and preserve wonder—but her choices feel observational rather than conflicted. The "peripherally focused" trait is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to seal the cavern and keep the discovery private arrives without visible internal struggle or cost that forecloses a live alternative. No secondary character applies pressure, leaving the protagonist's arc feeling more like contemplative documentation than transformation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The weaver's interiority is richly textured with embodied perception ("layers of silence stacked upon silence"), but her motivation remains abstract throughout—collecting burden-weights never generates internal conflict or a micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final "understanding" that she is boundary-lessly trapped arrives as epiphany rather than earned compression of contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs; she simply continues the work tomorrow. The protagonist observes and comprehends but never decides under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through her handling of the wood and the kettle ritual. The grief work is shown through micro-choices—picking up the blank, making the first cut—rather than summarized. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between haunting and practicality, though the final stance feels slightly too settled for peak tension. The carving practice earns the shift from raw grief to "rust-hued peace" through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kera's interiority shows embodied contradiction—she collects others' stories to avoid her own—and her ghost functions as externalized conscience. The final choice to extend her hand and begin modest gardens is earned by the camera wheel progression. However, the progression feels somewhat mechanical; the emotional shift from paralysis to action lacks sufficient intermediate micro-choices that would make the renunciation of grand ambitions viscerally costly rather than philosophically resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's professional curiosity and engineering mindset are consistent, and her observation-driven approach to the terminal feels character-particular. However, her interiority remains largely analytical without embodied contradiction or emotional friction—she moves from curiosity to vision to satisfaction without meaningful internal conflict. The autumn-to-winter work montage compresses agency into summary ("They worked through autumn's shortening days"), flattening what should be pressure-filled choices into recounted accomplishment. The final paragraph's "stoic wonder" registers as an asserted state rather than an earned emotional shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—"dreams were fragile things," stage fright as drowning—and her contradictory impulses (preservation vs. avoidance) drive the arc. The final choice to play "music that no one would judge and everyone could forget" embodies renunciation with visible cost: the virtuoso dream "truly gone" but a smaller, private practice now possible. Minor deduction: the "excruciatingly gentle" repetition leans decorative in places, and the phrase "bearing the weight of her abandoned dream like a stone" edges toward stock metaphor without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's arc from legend-seeker to truth-finder is legible and his discovery of Dessen's story earned, but his interior life remains somewhat abstract. The epiphany about the "architecture of lies" arrives on-page but feels announced rather than embodied—"hindsight clarity washed through him like cold water" tells the shift without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to photograph the maps and walk toward the city with "thoughtfully clear purpose" closes the arc but the emotional cost registers more as intellectual satisfaction than visible foreclosure of his prior identity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clearly established—seed collector seeking preservation wisdom—but her interiority reads generic rather than character-particular. The piece tells us she's "infinitely patient" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses under pressure; she encounters no genuine obstacles or costs that force hard choices. The final decision to share with Henrik's widow is stated as future intent without on-page trade-offs or visible foreclosing of alternatives. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "understanding flooding through her" rather than contradictory physical states that complicate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's occupation is articulated but her agency in this encounter is primarily observational until the late gesture with the pen. Thomas exhibits clearer internal contradiction—trembling hands that remember motion, grief versus potential—but both characters lean heavily into philosophical articulation rather than embodied struggle. The final shift ("held it like a compass") reads as asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("cartography of a weaver's soul") at moments requiring embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prince's interior world is richly embodied through his laboratory work and physical trembling, with motivation clearly rooted in a hunger for beauty lost. Internal contradiction appears in his awareness that his creation will be "flawed genesis...neither fully alive nor fully machine" yet he proceeds with "fierce hope," and the final recognition "Something flawed...But something that dreams" earns the closure choice. The father remains minimally sketched but serves his pressure function. Minor deduction for the phrase "quaking reverie" appearing as authorial annotation rather than emerging from concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistently embodied through her firefighter's hands and watchful presence. Marcus functions primarily as a vessel for her healing work rather than creating pressure through his own choices; his scarred hands are described but he makes no decision that alters tactics. The father's backstory provides weight but remains entirely off-page. Internal contradiction is minimal—Maya's gracefully alert quality reads more as a stable trait than as competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's trait of "realistic imagination" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her action at the fountain is guided more by magical mechanics than internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The label "luminous skeptic" and her doubt are asserted but never tested against a competing impulse in the closure beat. Embodied emotion is minimal; the phosphorescence functions as metaphor without physical consequence that shapes her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Keeper's characterization operates through reflection on millennia of experience, with clear emotional contradiction ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "troubling serenity," "peculiar grief their kind called 'hope'"). Internal conflict appears in the tension between enduring duty and inevitable disappointment, though the protagonist remains observational throughout—no on-page micro-choices alter present tactics or force a trade-off with visible cost. The final act of releasing seeds is continuation, not a choice that forecloses a path, limiting the score under the agency requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's journey from isolated monument carving to collective-grief understanding shows clear motivation, though the transformation leans heavily on Thomas's spectral instruction rather than her own pressure-tested choices. The epiphany feels more received than earned through on-page struggle. Interior moments like "fiercely meditative in her stillness" gesture toward depth but remain somewhat abstract. The final readiness to "carve differently" lacks a specific on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior life centers on precision as prayer and inherited ritual, with contradictory impulses visible when she performs the transfer despite its emotional weight. Her micro-choices (positioning the handle, measuring turns) embody her values, and the inheritance from her father grounds motivation in concrete loss. The piece treats her grief and duty as simultaneous rather than sequential, showing embodied contradiction. Minor issue: the "ethically diligent" frame remains asserted rather than tested by competing goods on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is legible—she seeks to honor Castellan's memory and validate his love—but the characterization remains observational rather than internally conflicted. The decision to plant a Helena rose feels inevitable from the first paragraph, with no competing impulse or visible cost that might foreclose another path. Embodied emotion is thin; the moment she reads the final letter lacks contradictory feelings or a moment where she must choose between preserving privacy and honoring the request. The interiority leans toward summary ("finally understood") rather than showing her stakes shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is established through her work as an "ignorance cartographer," but her motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The night's work is summarized competently, but no moment shows her wrestling with contradictory impulses or internal stakes beyond fulfilling the commission. Embodied emotion is sparse; the quill feels "alive," but Maren's own physical and emotional state during this supposedly trembling threshold remains abstract. The final choice to descend is a completion without visible cost or character alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's copyist work and clandestine encoding are given concrete embodied detail ("pen scratching," handling the radio, weaving fragments into scores). Her motivation to preserve narrative is clear and consistent, though her internal contradiction—desire to resist versus fear of discovery—remains somewhat muted; the "thistled calm" exterior softens the stakes of her choices. The closing image of continuing work is Earned Stasis with visible cost (isolation, perpetual vigilance), but the emotional progression flattens slightly as urgency never spikes on the page. Minor vocabulary register drift ("thistled calm," "pirate broadcast") reads slightly elevated for a working copyist under stress, though it remains within plausible poetic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and specific, rooted in the tactile world of charcoal and ash. Her contradictory impulses—honoring the vanishing practice while secretly preserving—act simultaneously in scene through physical choices (drawing technique, shard gathering). The relationship with Cassius pressures her stance and the final choice to preserve him is earned by the established pattern of secret reconstruction. Minor: her emotional progression during Cassius's death reads slightly smoothed; the grief could degrade perception more.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcellus is motivated by demonstrable fact over decree, with his "abrasive calm" showing consistent contradiction between internal conviction and external irrelevance. His micro-choices—excavating, cataloging, hiding evidence—are purpose-driven and reflect a philosopher's hierarchy of values. The interiority remains specific ("primitives who measured time in microseconds") and embodied through tactile engagement with artifacts. However, the internal conflict never forces a visible cost or stakes-altering choice on the page; he ends exactly where he began, methodically preserving, with no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is embodied through concrete gestures (tracing the rosette, arranging chairs) and her stance is consistent—"expectantly resigned" manifests in action. However, the students remain largely undifferentiated; Aisha and Thomas get names but no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The transformation is asserted ("they were hearing each other") rather than dramatized through a specific micro-choice that reveals internal conflict. The final cost—some students leaving—is mentioned but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation—cultivating memory against prohibition—is clear and consistent, but her interior life relies heavily on extended reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's wisdom is told rather than dramatized through a present micro-choice. The final act of stepping back and smiling reads as satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path; the pruning decisions earlier show some embodied choice, but the ending lands without felt renunciation or alteration that changes Mara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's involuntary truthfulness provides clear motivation and her compulsion to "elaborate truthfully" drives key beats. The internal contradiction between her isolation and capacity for wonder creates texture, and her choice to climb the tower with the lacquer box feels earned. The old woman remains somewhat archetypal, but her brief appearance serves the plot without demanding deeper interiority. Mira's final revelation moment risks slight over-articulation ("the capacity to be amazed by what should have been obvious") but the embodied action of climbing and revealing sustains the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is specific and perceptual ("shards of hush," recognizing orris root from childhood), with embodied knowledge driving her actions. The final choice to help the house remember is motivated by the orris root revelation and her grandmother's journals. However, the insight arrives through discovery rather than internal contradiction, and the emotional stakes remain largely intellectual curiosity about house-memory rather than personal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's telepathic exposition is controlled and her "incisive kindness" manifests in concrete choices (guiding the woman through the garden, allowing her to open the ampoule). The woman's internal conflict between certainty and nuance is embodied in her shaking hands and the decision to tell the truth. However, the other statues remain label-only until the final paragraphs, and the woman's transformation feels more conceptual than viscerally earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending choice lacks a visible tradeoff that would ground the abstract shift from "certainty" to "nuance."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's mathematical obsession is embodied through concrete actions (rolling dice, scratching equations) and her interior voice remains consistent throughout. The "grim optimist" trait manifests in her continued climbing despite understanding her trap, though the final paragraph's determination feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through prior micro-choices. Her realization that she powers the perpetual motion system creates genuine internal conflict, but the leap from despair to renewed hope in the final beats lacks a clear micro-choice that would anchor the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her methodical-hopeful trait is demonstrated through sustained action (painting over six months, collecting faces). The insomnia and lost-language research provide credible context. However, the daydream sequence ("saw the faces begin to move, to breathe") moves into unmotivated vision without clear agency cost, and the final decision to find the brush-giver feels more like a resolution announcement than an earned foreclosure of options. Interiority is mostly concrete but occasionally slips into abstraction ("threshold state where daydreams sparked").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Celeste's interiority is well-grounded in her museum training and grief management; the moment with the violinist shows genuine character interaction that alters emotional stakes. Internal conflict registers through "rosewater dread" and the weight lightening when she finds purpose, though the embodiment could be sharper under peak pressure. The violinist's grief is concretely realized ("thaw of grief too long frozen"), and Celeste's micro-choice to invite collaboration forecloses passivity with visible cost. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("collective survival") that doesn't quite land as character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation to escape "forward motion's tyranny" reads clear, but his interior life during the three-tide workshop sequence feels summarized rather than embodied—"bleak exhilaration" is told, not shown through contradictory impulses. The final wrist-snap decision lacks visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; he smiles "free" without dramatizing what he renounces. Diagnostic label-speak ("latent radiance," "radiance made solid") appears in peak beats without embodied pressure, pulling −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear—she fears her dissolving features—but the transformation from terror to acceptance feels under-earned; the advisor's whispers deliver the insight rather than forcing Vera into contradictory choices that make her pay for understanding. Embodied emotion is present (clutching the clasp, leaning into mirrors) but her internal arc tilts toward declarative epiphany ("what if disappearing was the point?") rather than dramatized struggle. The final renunciation of solidity reads as conceptually motivated but lacks visible cost in the moment; we see her speak and smile, not forfeit a concrete option or endure a loss that closes a door.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "turn obstacles into instruments" is stated but her interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The three-hour vigil shows endurance under pressure, and the final choice to rest carries modest cost, but internal conflict is thin—her doubts are sketched rather than felt in competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present (racing pulse, exhaustion) yet the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. The renunciation of further action at dawn qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible fatigue, meeting the length's requirement, but the psychological texture lacks the specificity that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her spiral-shell expertise is character-particular, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"quietly driven" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The descent and pattern-reading show micro-choices under pressure, but the expedition-finding beat summarizes rather than dramatizes her reaction to twelve arranged corpses. The final whistle sequence demonstrates agency, yet the cost of confronting the watchers is more atmospheric than viscerally felt through her body or specific fears.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Helena's motivation is clear and consistent—her commitment to truth against authority—but her internal conflict is largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The "emotionally rational" trait appears as a label ("her colleagues often mistook this for coldness") without constraining an on-page choice with visible cost. Her decision to sacrifice her career reads as straightforward rather than genuinely torn, and the trembling hands are the only embodied emotion in a pivotal beat. The final choice feels inevitable from the premise rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Garrett's interiority is concrete and well-anchored in sensory detail ("brass worn smooth by generations of palms"), and his grief-driven motivation is embodied through selective perception. The character's shift from measuring what exists to preserving what has vanished is traceable, though the progression feels more contemplative than pressured. Internal contradiction is present (the technical surveyor becoming emotional archivist) but operates mostly in reflection rather than forcing difficult micro-choices in scene. The final act of placing the note is consistent but lacks a visible cost or renunciation that would elevate the change.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation to uncover the truth about his grandmother's displacement is rooted in concrete stakes and drives his methodical investigation. His interior experience—"understanding shifting through him like light through deep water"—shows embodied thought, though some moments veer toward summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to photograph documents and pocket the stamp reads as earned by prior causality, but the ease of his escape and the lack of visible internal conflict at the closure beat prevent higher scoring. Minor slips: "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" feel like imposed descriptor phrases rather than organic character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's grief is embodied through concrete action (polishing gems, folding cranes) rather than pure summary, and her teaching others provides stakes beyond solipsism. However, the internal arc relies heavily on metaphor rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in choice—she moves smoothly from torment to acceptance without visible friction. The daughter exists only as absence and symbol; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of competing values. The final tea-pouring moment gestures at transformation but doesn't foreclose a live path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amal's motivation is grounded in trauma and her interior contradictions are palpable—she clings to grief-mad science while acknowledging rational warnings. The geode's dual function (scientific instrument and grief anchor) embodies her psychological state concretely. The final smile before devastation shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "bleak exhilaration" appears twice as a label rather than fully embodied sensation in pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal state is consistently filtered through her sharp observation and military background, and the pilgrim arrival creates genuine pressure. However, the protagonist's emotional shift from isolated searcher to connector feels rushed; the "tears surprising her eyes" moment and instant understanding of the grandmother's network arrive without sufficient embodied contradiction or struggle. The "frequency of belonging" realization lands as abstract epiphany rather than earned through micro-choices that cost her something concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority shows clear contradictory impulses—manufacturing false pasts while unable to rewrite her conscience—and her final confession is earned through three evenings of physical searching. Clara's quiet insistence ("again and again") creates pressure that forces Maren's shift. The backstory with Iris is substantial but anchors in the present through the watch hand discovery and changes Maren's stance from maintaining the lie to full disclosure. Minor slip: Iris's motivation ("sheltered from the hope") arrives as explanation rather than embodied struggle, trending toward diagnostic clarity that slightly flattens the peak revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interior is specific and embodied—the drawer pull as concrete anchor for her method, the synchronizing as practiced restraint. Her motivations are consistent: "the space between apology and forgiveness" drives her choices and the final commitment to demand hidden truths. Chen is less developed but serves as pressure; their relationship crystallizes around shared incomplete knowledge. The final turn (agreeing to bring real histories) feels earned by the brass piece exchange, though the epiphany about "incomplete truths" edges toward statement rather than discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's interior life is rendered through concrete details—the broken compass, the choice of "safer harbor," the memory of storm clouds—and her motivations clarify across the story. The renunciation of safety and move toward James is earned by the accumulation of regret and the final clarity that "the heart gravitates where it will." Minor weakness: the ex-fiancé's diagnostic line "You were never really here" edges toward label-speak, though it's brief and doesn't recur at closure. Embodied contradictions (terror and hope flickering together) and the visible cost of years lost strengthen the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is present but largely told rather than shown through embodied contradiction. The "hollow where her conscience should have been" reads as diagnostic label-speak, and her trajectory from trafficker to redemption-seeker lacks the micro-choices that would earn the shift. Marcus functions as oracle rather than applying real pressure. The final choice to "make the first choice that matters" remains abstract; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her emotional progression from resistance to transformation is embodied through physical sensations ("edges beginning to blur," "every cell crying out"). The internal conflict between preserving identity and allowing metamorphosis creates genuine tension. However, the brother remains a cipher—his presence in the ending is told rather than dramatized through specific gesture or choice, and the transformation's cost feels asserted ("hardest [language]") rather than viscerally earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nadia's interiority is concrete and filtered through her cartomancer's worldview ("willingly perplexed by her craft"). The guilt-driven motivation is clear, but the final choice to "rush downward…hurrying home to trace new hands together" feels under-earned; the transformation from ritual understanding to actionable change lacks a visible on-page micro-choice that forecloses the guilt path with cost. The weeping alone in the kitchen three nights ago provides embodied emotion, but the peak closure moment remains abstract wisdom rather than a dramatized renunciation or decision that costs something immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ren's interiority is concrete and specific—embodied in the gravitational response to emotion and the slow accumulation of grief stitching. The pacifist stance is lived through micro-choices (touching photographs, refusing violence, "I will not fight you") and the final passage through the dimension is earned by the shadow work arc. Minor slip: the sister's death "a hundred years ago" reads as exposition rather than felt memory, and the emotional calibration around joy/hope causing weightlessness occasionally edges toward mechanics explanation rather than immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maris's interior life suffers from label-only emotional processing ("understanding suddenly") and diagnostic clarity ("transformation's true texture: it felt like letting go") that no one possesses mid-crisis. The old woman exists solely to deliver exposition rather than apply immediate pressure through her own goals. Maris's shift from "just lost" to prophecy-fulfiller lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously; the arc reads as smooth acceptance rather than earned struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's inventive nature and revolutionary commitment are established, but her interior life remains largely instrumental—we see her moving through practiced actions without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The moments of tension (hiding from Captain Voss) lack genuine fear or doubt that would test her resolve. The ending choice to continue her patrol feels inevitable rather than earned through internal struggle, and her competence never meets meaningful friction that would reveal deeper character layers.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaela's interior states are vivid—"never staying in one place long enough for anyone to find her"—and her contradictory curse (seeing futures that hinder her) embodies internal conflict. Her transformation from fulfilling a promise as burden to blueprint is earned through the rock-placing sequence. However, the sister's death and Kaela's relationship to her remain told rather than embodied in present micro-choices; the emotional weight of the promise never faces a dramatized on-page test that would force a visible trade-off. The ending shift feels thematic rather than rooted in a prior contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("furiously tranquil," obsessive focus on scars as language), and her motivation deepens through the envelope reveal. However, the change from documenting her own poetic scars to carrying state-violence evidence feels more like plot mechanics than an earned contradiction forcing a visible cost. The final descent with photographs reads as resolve rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theodora's mechanical arm functions as a trait-marker but her interiority remains mostly declarative. The philosophical stance ("questions aren't obstacles—they're destinations") is asserted through dialogue rather than tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Venn's pivot at the end feels slightly underearned; the magistrate's curiosity emerges abruptly without prior micro-choices that would forecast the shift. Theodora's endurance of waiting and her final choice to offer the card carry visible cost, but the emotional texture stays at one register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Solomon's motivations are established through the prison-library backstory and crystallized in the line "to forge beauty from anarchy." The monthly name-shedding trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction on the page—it remains ornamental. Marcus arrives as a fully cooperative partner without internal conflict or competing impulses; their shared work proceeds without meaningful disagreement or cost. The decision to "stay Solomon" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's internal contradiction between performing crowd-pleasers and harboring his own composition is established, but the character's seventeen-year stasis lacks lived-in texture—why *now* does he act? The mother's cryptic note arrives as convenient catalyst rather than emerging from his agency. The final decision to play only his compositions tomorrow feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost; we don't see what he forecloses by refusing the tips that sustained him. Interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("steely longing," "wistful by nature") without embodied contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her role as reality checker grounds her actions, but internal conflict remains thin—she experiences "luminous doubt" as a label rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to plant the seed feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through visible struggle that forecloses other paths. Embodied emotion is present (gasping, fingers in soil) but the interiority leans toward explanation of her function rather than messy, irrational experience under pressure. The transformation reads more as completion of a task than a stance shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's grief and anger are clearly motivated, and her final forgiveness feels earned by the lace revelation. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The memory of turning away at sixteen provides concrete grounding, but the epiphany arrives through exposition rather than a dramatized micro-choice under present pressure. Takeshi remains a wise-guide archetype without pressure of his own.

Her transition from seeking silence to active resolution is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the chest-loosening realization.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and credible, grounded in her dual identity as neutron star researcher and daughter of the greenhouse’s creator. Her need for control and clean models is slowly challenged by the messy regeneration she observes, and the final choice to leave dust on her palms feels like an earned, costly renunciation of that control. Emotional responses are shown through attention and habit rather than labels. The only limit is that the mother–daughter dimension remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a live relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and embodied, with her history as a glass artist shaping how she perceives fire, stone, and frost, and her shift from self-centered “why me” to accepting she was “simply geography” feels credibly earned. Her motivations—to escape noise, to understand the ledger, to decide what to do next—are clear and consistent. The internal conflict between craving a grand narrative of survival and accepting more modest, accretive meaning is present but could surface in more overtly conflicted micro-choices under pressure. Nonetheless, her final decisions to testify and rebuild track cleanly with what we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s characterization is rich and coherent: the ferry disaster, her deafness, and her decision to reject conventional “rectification” all clearly motivate her devotion to the project. Her interiority is specific (reading notation as others read poetry, treating the tuning fork as talisman) rather than generic. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—the refusal of therapy is stated more than dramatized, so we don’t fully see her ambivalence or darker impulses under pressure. Claire functions as an effective relational mirror, but their dynamic is supportive rather than stressed, limiting how much the relationship itself is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Meridian is specific and textured—a weary underwater undertaker whose professional habits and belated guilt clearly drive her choices. Her motivation shift from earth-burial to creating undersea rest is legible and earned. However, her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized; we’re told her realization rather than feeling her wrestle with it moment by moment. Some emotional embodiment (physical sensations, irrational resistance) under pressure could deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives and temperament are clear and consistent, and her quiet assumption of leadership feels believable and grounded in specific choices (the midnight runs, revealing herself at the arbor). Her internal life is present but not deeply conflicted—there’s little sense of truly competing impulses, more a steady nobility that borders on idealized. Secondary characters (Sasha, Petrov, the “younger exiles”) are sketched more as functions in the argument than as individuated people. The final communal shift is earned, but it happens smoothly, without much mess or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina is vivid, particular, and internally consistent, with her "pilgrim of sparks" identity and mix of artistic and quasi-healer impulses driving concrete choices. The elderly woman’s regret about her daughter gives her enough specificity to avoid feeling like a prop. Marina’s realization at the end about unused love feels earned by what she witnesses, not handed down. Some language grazes therapy-speak abstraction (“where grief lodged, where anger crystallized”), which slightly blunts the otherwise embodied emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Miriam’s drive to understand the “texture of time” is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a maze designer grounds her choices. Interiority is vivid but skews conceptual rather than emotionally contradictory; we see little friction between self-preservation and her compulsion to know. Her dissolution at the end feels earned but reads more as serene acceptance than a pressured decision with strongly dramatized ambivalence. The lack of on-page relationships limits the crucible effect, keeping the characterization strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is specific and coherent (protecting the seeds as a path to true freedom), and her competence under pressure (mapping the keys, anticipating her chains) feels earned. Interiority is concise but effective, embodied in images like chains as choreography rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is relatively light—she’s mostly steadfast rather than torn—which keeps this just below the top band. The young soldier is thinly sketched but does supply a credible relationship/pressure crucible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, synesthesia, and illness combine into a coherent, specific character whose motives (mending trust, finishing the work before cancer ends her) are clear and consistent. Her interiority is vivid in sensory and technical obsessions but less so in directly dramatized ambivalence; she mostly moves steadily toward the forge without a concrete on-page dilemma. The emotional cost of using her own losses as material is implied rather than fully pressured in-scene. Still, the final stance—choosing to embed her own cells and losses in the work—feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation and history are clear and specific—her hunger “to press your ear against destiny’s door” aligns with her career of theft and readiness to decode the flower code. Her emotional beats (shock at seeing herself, dawning understanding of the portraits’ purpose, the shift from thief to witness) feel earned. However, the internal conflict is relatively smooth; she moves from belief to epiphany with little visible resistance or contradiction, which slightly softens the sense of struggle at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and specific—her playful self-narration, her attraction to the field journal, and her philosophy of “safe zones for inquiry” feel character-particular and consistent. Motivation (to make fragile sanctuaries for questions) is clear and embodied through the glasswork. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a moment of real internal contradiction under pressure; she never has to choose between competing values, so the arc feels more like steady exposition than earned change. The final stance (smiling, drawing) is resonant but costs her nothing visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and particular—the phobia-ridden stunt double whose real talent is adaptation is a strong, specific contradiction, and her realization that her fears were manufactured yet still real is emotionally sophisticated. Her final stance (embracing vulnerability as power) grows credibly from her history of “faking courage” but acting anyway. Carson is somewhat archetypal as the manipulative mentor, yet his role as handler/conditioner is clear and his power over her is legible in their exchange. The main limitation is that we’re told about conditioning and breadcrumb history more than we see her wrestle with concrete, conflicting impulses in the moment of confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent: continuing the oracle’s work to understand and navigate the oncoming darkness. Her embodied experience (wind, cold, textures of silence) grounds her interiority and makes her more than an abstract thinker. However, she faces little on-page contradiction or moral friction; “mildly obsessed” never quite sharpens into a live, conflicted dilemma. The final stance—accepting the task of mapping the dark—feels earned but not particularly costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    J-7’s curiosity, composure, and history of “breaking itself wondering” give it a specific interior life for an AI, and the six-hour broom freeze is an excellent character-defining anecdote. The decision to accept the Program and the on-page choices around the violin and resuming sweeping feel motivated and consistent. However, the inner conflict remains primarily conceptual; there’s little embodied strain or contradiction in the present scene (no real tug between stopping, rebelling, or surrendering) to deepen the cost of its stance. The final acceptance of endless sweeping is earned intellectually but only lightly dramatized emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira, Viktor, and Elena each have clear, specific motives and roles, and Mira’s shift from self-doubt to speaking up is legible and earned. Viktor’s guilt is embodied in the doodles and his breakdown at being “found,” which feels human. However, internal contradiction is relatively lightly sketched—Mira’s hesitation and fear resolve quickly once Viktor confesses, with limited messy ambivalence on the page. Some emotional language lands close to thesis-speak rather than felt, character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply sketched: aging, proud, strategic, with a clear throughline from past exploitation to present experiment. Her motives (to prove what algorithms miss and to reclaim her record) are coherent and drive concrete choices, and Marcus provides a useful foil. The embodied emotional cost of risking dismissal and of revisiting her old deception could be deepened; she reads composed almost to a fault. Still, her actions and worldview feel particular and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Renna’s dutiful, self-effacing nature and secret ambition are clearly drawn, and her micro-choices (abandoning her experiment to help, deciding to reveal it) track well with those traits. Her emotional life is mostly implied through action and perception rather than labels, which feels credible. However, internal conflict is relatively muted—her fear of exposure never forces a truly difficult choice or visible cost on the page. Voss’s quick, unconflicted acceptance also flattens the relationship pressure that could have revealed more about both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste is specific and convincing as a long-time pit musician drawn back by half-remembered melodies, with clear embodied reactions (wading, tracing patterns, clutching the journal). Her motivation to return despite the building being condemned is plausible and rooted in character, and her affinity for “in-between spaces” feels earned. Internal conflict (shouldn’t be here vs. compulsion to follow the code) is present but relatively gentle and not fully dramatized under pressure. The final decision to embrace Magdalena’s language is credible, though the emotional cost of that disruption could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s guilt, professional rigor, and evolving relationship to uncertainty are rendered with textured interiority and clear, embodied stakes. Her flaw (overconfidence in “reasonable” filters) directly fuels the past tragedy and the present recalibration choice, which feels both inevitable and costly. The swallowed-truth motif (“like a stone”) pays off well in the ballast image at the end. Chen functions minimally but effectively as a gentle counter-pressure rather than a full crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation as a skeptical, compulsively driven explorer is clear and consistent, and her exhaustion/“drowsy alertness” gives her interiority a nice texture. Her analytic habit (mapping calls, treating testimonies as strata) is character-specific and feeds her choices. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she’s more steady than genuinely torn—so her final stance shift toward “religiously skeptical faith” lands more as refinement than hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chronicle keeper’s worldview and motivation are sharply drawn and consistent, and her micro-choices (accepting the stone, using it on the swan, integrating it into the archive) align with that motivation. However, she experiences almost no felt ambivalence or internal friction; “equanimity” dominates, which flattens potential contradiction. Her emotional life is more implied by the environment than embodied in specific, surprising reactions. The final endurance/renunciation (choosing to fold this event back into the archive and leave) lands, but the personal cost is kept abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivations are clear and specific—Maya’s vocation, Mrs. Chen’s need for emotional reconnection, Diane’s busyness and distance—and they all converge credibly in the eclipse scene. The mother/daughter shift from polite distance to genuine contact feels earned by the combination of music, keepsake, and atmosphere, though Diane’s emotional opening happens very quickly. Interiority for Maya is somewhat generalized but consistent, grounded in her orientation toward “ordinary magic.” The relationship crucible is strong: Diane’s softened reaction to the curl and lullaby is a decisive, believable turn.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The historian is specific, with a coherent vocation and sensory way of engaging the world, and her motivation to archive human echoes is clear. However, she experiences little on-page internal contradiction or live dilemma, so we see stance more than struggle. Her “change” is largely an articulated understanding of the displaced axis, not a pressured reorientation. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margaret is specific and believable—the jazz/transposition metaphor, her long tenure, and her attitude toward “meaningless” fortunes all feel lived-in. Her emotional journey from bemused dismissal to unsettled, then to a kind of wry acceptance, is coherent but low-intensity, with limited on-page contradiction or pressure. The spy’s presence usefully refracts her, though his role is more expositional than crucible-like. The final choice—how seriously to take her own power—lands, but without a sharply dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Father Micah is sharply drawn through his tools, methods, and quiet confidence; his vocation feels specific and lived-in. His motivation (to stop the possession via exposing faulty assumptions) is clear and consistently expressed in action and speech. However, he faces little visible internal contradiction or doubt under pressure, which flattens potential complexity. Elena functions largely as an object of the exorcism rather than a fully realized secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and textured—her chronological homesickness, ritual with the shell, and exhaustion window feel lived-in and coherent with her motives. Her desire “to become the conductor of unheard symphonies” personalizes what could have been a vague artistic longing. However, she faces little in the way of live internal contradiction beyond wanting to continue writing versus needing rest, so micro-choices under pressure are relatively soft. The ending’s endurance/renunciation (stopping when exhaustion hits) is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and textured—the realization that she is what’s darkening rather than the viaduct is character-particular and emotionally grounded. Her obsession and fatigue are both evident, and the final renunciation (letting herself “fall” and then walking home) is credibly earned by the accumulation of failed timelines. The internal contradiction between the fantasy of a “perfect Maya” and the dawning acceptance of fracturing is dramatized rather than merely asserted. Still, most of her struggle is reflective rather than enacted in present-tense micro-choices, which slightly softens the impact under this exacting bar.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and compelling—her deafness, vocation, and encroaching numbness all cohere into a clear, motivating engine. Her choices (seeking the cavern, dedicating weeks to preparation, then guiding students) track cleanly with that motivation. Internal conflict is present but largely summarized rather than dramatized in sharp, in-scene moments of doubt or contradiction. Secondary characters (students, dead drum maker) are more thematic functions than fully pressurizing presences, which slightly flattens the emotional crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren is sharply etched—professional rigor, political caution, and a principled sense of integrity all cohere—and her decision to “progress laterally” grows credibly from those traits. Her interiority is concrete (the pigeon, the satchel, the courtyard) rather than generic. Internal conflict is present but mild: she’s uneasy about being used but never truly tempted to collaborate or refuse outright, which keeps the spectrum of possible choices narrower than it could be. The ending stance (choosing completeness over partisanship) feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dalton’s grief, profession, and specific history with his wife create a nuanced, internally consistent character whose motives clearly drive the scene, especially his insistence on comparing old and new scents. His internal conflict—wanting understanding but fearing the emotional cost of scent—is credible and embodied. The final acceptance of carrying grief “like light in a careful vessel” feels earned by what we’ve seen. Dr. Miren is thin but functionally appropriate as a quiet foil and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus and Elena are cleanly sketched with distinct roles—lyric drift versus scientific rigor—and their motives (his attraction to impossible choices, her need to map the “texture of time”) are legible and consistent. Their relationship develops via mutual recognition and reframing rather than plot mechanics, which suits the piece’s scale. However, internal conflict remains largely conceptual, with little embodied struggle or visible cost beyond exhaustion and fear of the infinite regress. The final stance shift feels earned but relatively low-friction, more articulation than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to unbind trapped sound and gently loosen the hush—is clear, consistent, and rooted in a specific background (the bonfire storytelling tradition). Interiority is present and particular (“She remembered how sound could gather and grow...”), but her emotional conflict is quite low-friction; she moves from perception to action without much resistance or cost. Her competence feels a bit too smooth, with no visible mistakes or contradictory impulses under pressure. The final stance—accepting unfinishedness as “enough”—is earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is sharply drawn through her professionalism, sensory way of reading emotions, and her mix of real care and commercial calculation; Thomas is sketched efficiently but credibly as a grieving father. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her final self-knowledge about losing authenticity feels earned by what we’ve seen of her methods. Internal contradiction is present (empathy vs. commerce), but it remains mostly conceptual rather than expressed in truly conflicted in-scene impulses. The emotional impact is therefore strong but not yet devastatingly specific enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlena is clearly motivated—professional shrewdness, latent guilt, and a susceptibility to "fate's small suggestion" all cohere into her decision to start a recognition program. Her shame at not thanking workers and her excitement about initiating change give her some inner contradiction, though the conflict resolves a bit too smoothly. Theo is sketched efficiently with the father backstory, but he mainly functions as a gentle catalyst rather than a fully pressured character. The final shift in Marlena’s stance feels earned but relatively low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sculptor’s longing for belonging is clear, specific, and consistently motivates her choices, from listening to locals to proposing the sculpture as a communal gift. Interiority is well-rendered and character-particular (“boldly sympathetic,” marsh-reed craft as lens), with only light reliance on abstract phrasing. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under pressure stays fairly gentle; there’s little dramatized push-pull between staying an outsider vs. risking deeper entanglement. Secondary figures are sketched with efficient vividness but rarely exert direct pressure back on her beyond accepting her proposal.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to discover and document the origin of echoes—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her vocation and illicit bargain. Her small moral compromise (borrowing time with intent to repay) adds nuance, but on-page internal conflict is relatively mild; she rarely doubts or hesitates. Emotional texture is present yet understated, with more curiosity and awe than pressure or fear. The final endurance/renunciation (spending her borrowed time, accepting the cost) feels earned but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marius’s interiority is specific and textured—his dual identity as conjurer/mathematician and his obsession with “the mathematics of emotion” feel organically tied to his grief. His motivation to resolve ambiguous loss is clear and drives every choice in the scene, including the ritual with the eyes. The realization about transformation rather than disappearance is earned by prior images (stalactite time, fruit, mosaic), not a bolt from nowhere. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (rationalist vs. magician, denial vs. acceptance) and could be made a touch more embattled on the page to hit the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s arc from hyper-competent invisibility to risking visibility is cleanly motivated and grounded in concrete habits (pipe-chase caches, memorized shelves). The tape-triggered memory of her grandmother provides a plausible emotional hinge rather than a generic epiphany. Internal conflict at the reveal moment is implied more than dramatized; we could feel her fear of being seen more viscerally. The boy is lightly sketched but functions credibly as a mirror of her former desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s control-obsession, scientific mindset, and reluctance to change are clearly motivated and embodied in his choices (wiring, pruning, note-taking, then cutting wires and changing methods). His interiority is specific (“circuitously sincere,” identity bound up in “perfect rows”) and his transformation is legible and earned. The main limitation is that his resistance melts somewhat smoothly; we don’t see him truly falter or backslide under pressure, which slightly softens the felt cost of his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The painter’s exhaustion, compulsion to paint, and ambivalent relationship to sleep are concrete and specific, and her small choices (pocketing the brooch, proposing “I think this is why,” pinning the butterfly) feel rooted in that psyche. The survivors are sketched efficiently yet distinctly—the net-mender’s futile industry and the coat-layered woman’s line about the rain both reveal believable coping modes. The shift from enforced insomnia to earned sleep is an internal change with a credible emotional price. Slightly more contradiction at the moment of ritual (e.g., doubt versus desire for meaning) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera is clearly motivated by her vocation of teaching wonder, and her clairvoyance plus blind spot around the cave’s evolving magic make her feel specific rather than generic. Her emotional shift from control to uncertainty to delighted terror is legible and earned. However, her internal conflict is relatively gentle—there’s little dramatized struggle between fear and acceptance before she leans into awe, so the change, while convincing, lacks sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maris’s vocation and motivation (“to compile fragments into meaning”) are clear and consistently enacted through her choices, from establishing staggered observation intervals to taking the first boat out. However, her interiority remains largely unconflicted and idealized; the seven-year exile is an evocative fact but never tests her in-scene. Emotional cost—shame, resentment, fear of failure on her return—stays mostly off the page. The result is a strong but somewhat smoothed characterization that could bear more contradiction and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation and skillset are crisply established—her compulsion to map and her ability to read hidden structure make every subsequent choice feel earned. The tension between fear (“every instinct screamed caution”) and compulsion to follow the arrows gives her at least one credible internal conflict. The final choice—to select a small, personal truth over a grand one—fits her character and carries emotional weight, though the cost could be shaded with more contradiction or doubt. Overall she feels specific and coherent, but not yet deeply conflicted or flawed enough for top-tier literary complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s burnout, skepticism, and residual capacity for hope are clearly established and cohere with her choices around the tile and Amit’s work. Her interiority feels specific rather than generic, particularly in the way her medical past colors her reaction to the whales and numbers. However, the internal conflict (flight from pain vs. re-engagement with connection) is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in discrete pressured moments. The closing shift to “translator of forgotten songs” is emotionally plausible but could carry more on-page cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vesper’s motivation—seventeen millennia of grief and boredom coalescing into a desperate need to know “what happens after goodbye”—is clear and consistent, and the fear/hope tension at the storm’s onset is strong. Her interiority is mostly conceptual and elevated, though, with limited concrete, idiosyncratic embodiment, so she feels a touch archetypal. The final decision to step into the between-space is adequately prepared but could land with more visible cost or contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira is sharply realized: the con artist’s daughter who clings to honesty, torn between her upbringing and the pragmatic ethics of asylum. Her micro-choices—refusing to forge, agreeing to wait, framing the SD card as “returning property”—all arise credibly from that conflict. Pavel is sketched economically yet distinctly, his desperation and reverence for Elena pressuring Mira without caricature. The only small limit is that Mira’s internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly given the weight of her father’s shadow; a touch more irrational fear or hesitation at the peak might deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stationer’s motivation—“to collect the textures of different times”—is precise and coherently embodied in her routines and choices. Her interiority is particular (using lamp frequencies as emotional textures) rather than generic, and her solitude feels earned by temperament, not trope. Internal conflict is subtle (real vs. invented histories, silence as refuge vs. burden) but never quite comes to an overt, pressured contradiction. The final choice to place the invented history in the labyrinth reads as a continuation of her discipline more than a hard, costly turn, which keeps this short of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is vivid: a legally dead ex-chemist turned “ghost” archivist with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her erasure and guilt. Her interiority is specific (the plant logo as “scar tissue,” the texture of memories as “rough”) and her micro-choices (where she positions herself, what she notes) align with that drive. What’s missing at this level is on-page contradictory impulse or a pressured decision; she’s already fully committed to her role, so we don’t see her pay a fresh emotional price in scene. The ending stance feels more affirmed than changed, which limits depth of character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s skepticism, professional history, and family ties to the objects all feel specific and credible, and her curiosity about the riddle cleanly motivates every action. The pivot from debunker to believer is emotionally legible and grounded in prior traits. What’s missing at this level is stronger on-page internal contradiction or resistance as the realization arrives; she moves into acceptance with little struggle. The cost of overturning twenty years of work is more implied than dramatized in her body or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s divided loyalties and specific role (“culture shock absorber” by day, resistance organizer by night) give her a vivid, particular psychology, and her proposal for cooperative shares feels motivated by accumulated pressure rather than a bolt from nowhere. Her internal conflict between preservation and pragmatic compromise is clear and continuous, not toggled on/off. The relationship with Marcus has credible tension and mutual complicity, though it could use one sharper moment of truly clashing values. Emotional embodiment is decent but leans on summary (“tearing her apart”) rather than more idiosyncratic physicalization under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motive—to preserve Valentina’s memory against erasure—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. Professional competence and ritual gestures (the sand grain, the beacons) give her texture beyond a stock “scientist-activist.” Internal contradiction is present but muted: she resists “progress” without much visible doubt or irrationality, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting the crater’s loss while salvaging its image) is earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is sharply etched as a competent, devoted artisan whose blindness has been fully metabolized into her working self; her motives and values are clear and embodied in process. However, there’s almost no internal contradiction or visible cost—she never wavers, struggles emotionally, or faces a choice that tests those values. The result is a rich character sketch rather than a pressured arc. The closing “she would be ready” feels like confirmation, not a new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motive (obsessive pursuit of the true river sources) is clear and feeds every choice, and her blend of dry practicality and almost mystical receptivity feels specific and embodied. The small gestures—scraping rust, tracing condensation—reveal how she thinks. Internal conflict is present but light; we don’t see a deep clash between career risk, physical danger, and intellectual compulsion so much as a smooth slide into acceptance. The closing decision to go onto the ice tomorrow is believable but could carry more explicitly felt cost or ambivalence to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell tuner’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and her occupational particularity (waterfall, city doorway) gives her some individuality. However, she remains largely an archetype—“cryptic,” “infinitely patient”—without on-page contradiction or genuine struggle. Emotional stakes for her (beyond professional purpose) are minimal, so we don’t feel much cost in her departure. The townspeople are effectively atmospheric presences rather than full characters, which fits the mode but limits character richness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motivations (professional curiosity, ethical responsibility, instinct for safety) are clear and come into credible tension when she must choose between surfacing and attempting an impossible rescue. Her internal conflict around “instinct vs action” is nicely crystallized in “By overriding instinct…,” but the emotional and moral cost of that override could be deepened. Thalia is vivid and active through gesture and gaze, though she functions more as catalyst and repository of history than as a fully dimensional character. The relationship beat—two isolated women finding each other—is effective but resolved a bit too cleanly to feel fully crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is sharply etched: his inherited stigma, vow of truth, and hunger for “hush” give him a distinct interior life, and the remembered failure to warn those three prisoners is a compelling flaw. His core motive—to reclaim his voice from his father’s shadow—is clear and consistent, and the final decision to speak later feels earned. However, the internal conflict (keep silent vs risk being disbelieved) is mostly discussed rather than pressure-tested in an on-page encounter, so the change lands a bit softly. More embodied contradiction under immediate pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s loneliness, inherited duty, and dawning sense of purpose are vivid, and the ghost bride has a clear emotional texture and agenda. However, Elara encounters little real resistance—her acceptance of the night and of the bride’s terms feels almost frictionless. Internal contradiction (fear vs longing, skepticism vs belief) is more implied than dramatized in concrete micro-choices. The final commitment with the bead reads motivated but not deeply costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to restore the labyrinth’s intended, living use—is clear and consistent, and her sleepwalking plus textile practice give her a distinct identity. However, interior conflict is underdeveloped; we rarely see fear, doubt, or ambivalence about defying the council, so her transgression feels relatively uncostly. Her emotional life is more implied by imagery than embodied in specific, pressured moments. The final choice to join the walkers tracks, but it doesn’t reveal a new contradiction or sacrifice so much as confirm what we already know.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (diaspora-rootlessness, need to complete the rites) is clear and consistent, and her “purposeful wandering” plus attachment to the sundial reveal a distinct, curious temperament. The priest’s brief appearance provides a useful relational crucible, reframing his earlier rejection of the rites. However, internal conflict is relatively gentle—her values don’t clash hard with any on-page opposition—so her final stance feels more like confirmation than a costly reversal. The change (“wandering had found its center”) is credible and earned, but its price is soft and largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya is sharply etched—her care with the clipboard, reverence for analog mail, and quiet understanding of the teens’ “digital suicide pact” all feel particular and motivated. Her micro-choices (kneeling to decode, smearing the chalk, pressing the letter into Chen’s hand, beginning tomorrow’s codes) align cleanly with that motive. The internal conflict is more implied than dramatized, so we don’t see her truly torn or degraded under pressure, which keeps this just below the top band. Chen serves well as a foil but applies little real pressure to Maya’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is vivid and specific: her cultivated foolishness, listening habit, and textile metaphors give her a strong interior logic. Her motivation to remain underestimated while quietly gathering patterns is clear and drives her choices through the piece. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or emotional friction as she moves from suspicion to certainty; the transition feels smooth rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Isla’s longing, shame, and dawning recognition are clearly motivated and embodied (clutching the letters, noticing her sister’s trembling hands), and the relationship with the sister gains depth via the discovered letters. Her internal contradiction—defensiveness versus desire to repair—is present but could be pushed harder under peak pressure. The medium is archetypal yet vivid and coherent in motive (to midwife a choice), though she remains more symbolic than psychologically particular. The final shift toward reconciliation is emotionally credible but arrives a touch easily given five years of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya is sharply drawn—a professional translator whose instincts persist through morphine haze—and her choice to engage, share the coral, and commit to “write them together” feels motivated by accumulated experience and hinted unhealed wounds. The child is credible as “shrewdly innocent,” with eyes that “hold too much knowledge,” though her inner life remains more sketched than deeply dramatized. The final shift—Maya recognizing her own collected traumas and choosing to transform that burden into collaborative work—is earned, but the “lotus-hearted ache” leans slightly toward tidy epiphany. I wanted a bit more friction or hesitation around that promise to push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s artistic burnout and quiet hunger for joy are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (tracing the fresco instead of overwriting it, choosing impossible fruit colors, deciding to stream) reveal values without exposition. The embodied interiority—fog as reverse-developing film, her laughter shocking her—feels specific rather than generic. The internal conflict between professionalized performance and authentic joy is present but could sharpen further under direct pressure (a real risk, constraint, or temptation to retreat into mere spectacle). Her final realization is earned but tilts close to tidy insight; a bit more friction or cost on the page would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marta feels specific—a meticulous, imaginative restorer whose professional habits (layer-tracking, imagined conversations with painters) plausibly seed her later willingness to question reality. Her shift from valuing certainty to embracing nested ambiguity is motivated by her experiences with the murals and the nickel, with a credible mix of unease and liberation. The internal conflict between documentation and play could be dramatized a bit more under direct pressure rather than mostly in reflective summary, but the arc is still coherent and earned. The final choice (leaning into another awakening) fits the character established on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Malachi’s characterization is vivid and specific—a disgraced, charismatic scholar whose motives (protecting cognitive freedom) clearly drive his choices from the opening rant to the garden network. Interiority is present but relatively thin; he doesn’t exhibit much contradiction or on-page doubt under pressure, which keeps him from feeling fully three-dimensional. Secondary characters (Iris, Dr. Chen, the older man) are sketched efficiently, with the father’s anecdote sharply deepening stakes. The ending’s endurance stance (“they can tax thoughts, but…”) is earned but emotionally under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s interiority is specific and textured—centuries of insomnia, her relationship to the shell, and her artistic mission all feel grounded and consistent. Her shift from solitary “photosynthesizing pain” to collaborative creation with Mira is motivated by the postcards and Mira’s hopefulness, and the ending’s near-rest reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but soft (she longs for sleep yet has built an identity around sleepless creation), which fits the quiet mode. Mira is sketched with economical but distinct traits that immediately clarify the relational dynamic and stakes of companionship.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Miren’s vocation, competence, and quiet devotion are sharply drawn, and her emotional investment in the orchids feels specific rather than generic. The interiority is concrete (“foxglove regret”) and tied to action as she troubleshoots the chime and experiments with recordings. However, she faces little genuine internal contradiction or moral bind—her wants and actions are aligned throughout—so the final stance is more an affirmation than a hard-won shift. The endurance/purpose at the end is credible but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s guilt and obsessive solitude versus her need for connection come through clearly, and Kael’s hurt/hope tension is nicely dramatized in his initial reserve and quick intellectual engagement. Their shared professional idiom and physical beats around the ink well feel specific and earned. The main weakness is that the emotional reversal—from estrangement to renewed partnership—comes a bit smoothly, with relatively little on-page resistance or mess at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s competence, curiosity, and professional mindset are clear and consistent, and her problem-solving choices drive every turn. However, her inner conflict about the moral weight of the decision is underplayed, so the resolution feels more like elegant engineering than a painful ethical choice. The villagers and the elder function more as archetypes than pressured individuals. The ending change in communal stance is credible but emotionally low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s guilt, self-mythologizing, and tentative movement toward honesty are sharply drawn and consistent, with concrete anchors like the meteorite chip and the attic routines. Her contradictory impulses—to protect herself with lies and to expose herself by pressing play and then confessing—are present in scene and culminate in a believable, costly choice. Yuki is lightly sketched but functions well as a patient, steady counterweight whose presence forces Elena’s hand. The only small limitation is that Elena’s decision to open up happens relatively quickly once the device arrives, leaving slightly less room for on-page struggle in that pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete associations (wood grain, mazes, codes), and her motivation to re-interpret her parents’ choices feels coherent and earned. The discovery about her mother’s logbook and career reconfigures their family history in a way that matches her traits of persistence and pattern-seeing. However, her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized; contradictory impulses don’t quite clash on the page so much as resolve smoothly into insight. The final stepping-through reads emotionally credible but could carry sharper on-page hesitation or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s outsider status, mystical training, and yearning for belonging are cleanly motivated and consistently dramatized, and Chen’s quiet openness provides a believable relational counterpoint. Her shift from solitary observer to collaborative pattern-seeker with Chen earns the final sense of inclusion. Internal contradiction (skeptical environment vs her faith in patterns) is present but could be sharpened under more pressure. The emotional palette stays a bit safe, with little real risk or flaw exposed beyond shyness and marginalization.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Calla’s motivation (the vanished road to her grandmother’s house) is clear, specific, and convincingly tied to her current vocation. The “cheerful gloom” contradiction gives her interiority texture, and her reactions to the paths’ emotions feel character-particular rather than generic. However, she encounters little true resistance or morally fraught choice; the arc is more contemplative than pressured. The final stance shift (from trying to restore to choosing to witness and repeat) is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s characterization as an analytical performer is specific and convincing, with her “lightly distributed” attention and chess-inflected thinking giving her a clear interior texture. Her choices (dropping the ball, scattering cards, offering the bishop) are rooted in that mindset and feel coherent. What’s missing for top-tier work is a felt internal contradiction or cost: she’s highly competent but never truly strained, and no value conflict tests her methods or motives.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to preserve and embody forbidden memory—is clear, consistent, and escalates credibly from exile to becoming a living archive. Her interiority is specific enough to feel individual (the harbor, her grandmother, the tide-dancing craft) rather than generic. However, her transformation is narrated in slightly abstract, epiphanic language (“Her motivation crystallized with perfect clarity”) that flattens potential contradiction or doubt. A touch more visible ambivalence or cost in the moment of choosing to mark her body would deepen the characterization to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Samuel is cleanly motivated, with a distinct professional lens and history that plausibly drive his decision to come early and “argue” with light rather than words. His values are legible in micro-choices (stones, sketches, photography), but internal contradiction is muted—he rarely feels genuinely torn, so the emotional cost remains low. The developer relationship is inferred rather than dramatized, which limits relational pressure. Overall, he reads as specific and credible but not yet fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is sharply realized through his professional competence, scars, and inherited sense of sacrificial duty, with a clear throughline from childhood trauma to present vocation. His motivation—to understand his father’s “bargains” and his own—is specific and consistent, and the final choice to continue the bargain knowingly feels earned. The embodied details (burned knuckles, walking burned earth) keep emotion grounded. A slight tendency toward abstract/therapy language in places (“pain journals,” “universal language”) keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motive—to salvage a “beautiful but useless” theory and prove that trying matters—is clear, specific, and coherently threaded from the funding collapse to the ending realization. Her logical dreamer nature and stubbornness feel particular in details like recalibrating the gauge and arranging shells by Fibonacci and quantum distributions. The main limitation is the relative absence of embodied, contradictory emotion under pressure; she rarely feels genuinely torn or destabilized, which softens the cost of her final stance. The closure choice (to continue returning and experimenting) is earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s vocation, worldview, and motive (“to discover what walls dream about”) feel distinct and grounded in concrete practice, and her reactions to the ivy, diaries, and anomalies are consistent and particular. However, she faces little real micro-level conflict or contradictory impulse on the page, so her final stance costs her almost nothing. The late understanding of Eleanor’s burden is conceptually strong but not dramatized as a difficult choice. This keeps the characterization from fully entering the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aina’s grief, ritualized hope, and the embodied image of the “borrowed heartbeat” create a complex, specific interior life, and her repeated choice to return to the terrace and to keep singing under time pressure feels fully motivated. The tension between her apparent calm and ferocious longing is dramatized in details like birds landing on her and the crack in her voice. Her final reframing of the heartbeat as possibility rather than clinging reads earned by the preceding ritual and visions. The only small limitation is that her internal conflict edges toward tidiness in the closing realization, where a bit more unresolved contradiction could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirena’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in long-term guilt and persistence, and her clipboard ritual in particular feels psychologically credible. The dynamic between her, Kordas, and Threll is sharply sketched, with legible history and grief in few strokes. However, Mirena’s internal conflict is underplayed—she reads almost unwaveringly principled, with limited on-page struggle against anger or despair in the peak beat. A touch more contradictory impulse in her at the moment of kneeling would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is sharply etched as an amoral visionary whose philanthropy cloaks calculated ecocide, and his fixation on the dove/echo is credible and specific. However, his inner conflict is mostly asserted (“He was secretly sentimental… Sentiment was weakness”) rather than dramatized in micro-choices or contradictions during the key beat. His final stance—accepting the cost and walking away—is coherent but emotionally under-contested on the page. A bit more embodied hesitation or self-deception in the climax would deepen him from strong concept to fully lived person.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Celestine’s interiority is specific and coherent, with clear motivation rooted in her refusal to be reduced to an object and her drive to redefine her purpose. Her skills, history as a courtesan, and family legacy (grandmother, mother) feed directly into her choices in the courtyard. However, her internal conflict remains relatively smooth—her serenity dominates, with little on-page contradiction or real fear—so the change feels somewhat low-friction. The final stance is earned but could carry more visible emotional cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motivations (defending his approach to “ethical storytelling”) are clear and consistent, and his interiority around the partner’s accusations and the drunk’s interruption feels specific rather than generic. His serenity, doubt, and pride register as a believable mix, with the final repricing of what his work means reading as earned. However, the conflict with the partner, though pivotal, is entirely off-page, so their relationship never quite becomes the crucible it could be. The drunk remains a functional catalyst more than a character, limiting relational complexity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sera’s vocation, temperament, and ethics are sharply etched, and her actions (collecting moth wings, constructing the spiral) align cleanly with that characterization. Motivation is clear and specific—bearing witness to overlooked endings—but she faces little on-page contradiction or hard trade-off. Emotional texture stays mostly within a single, contemplative register. The final stance (continuing to her “next forgotten place”) is credible but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s motivation (atonement through preservation) is specific, consistent, and tightly bound to her history as a caster and the lost bells. The emotional arc from frozen guilt to active restoration is clear and earned, though most of the inner conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Her competence and tenderness with materials feel particular rather than generic. A bit more live contradiction on the page (doubt vs. drive as she works) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.7)
    Hindsight’s motivation is clear and particular—she’s driven by a long-haunting question about why paths choose walkers, and every on-page choice (seeking the bunker, opening the box, submitting to the dream) aligns with that. Interiority is specific in places (“precisely playful touch,” letting rain fall on her eyelids) and the final conceptual shift feels earned by prior setup. However, her emotional contradiction under pressure (fear vs curiosity vs dread) stays mostly in the abstract, so the revelation lands more intellectually than viscerally. A bit more embodied cost in accepting that free will may belong to paths, not people, would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply sketched as frugal, devout to the cosmos, and shaped by political scarcity, with concrete habits (counting candle stubs, guarding paper) grounding her. Her motivation—covenant with the unknown—is clear and consistent, and her final choice to carry the tile forward feels earned. What’s missing for a higher score is pronounced internal contradiction or a real clash between competing impulses; she mostly moves along one clean vector. The emotional cost of her stance is implied rather than dramatized under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s resentment-anchored identity and eventual breakdown are clear and credible, and Elena’s “schemer pacifist” stance guides her micro-choices in how she phrases each intervention. However, some of her awareness reads more like an authorial therapist than a specific, flawed person (“architecture of his sense of self,” “resentment was a teacher”), softening the sense of genuine interior contradiction. Marcus’s turn from rigid anger to tears is a bit rapid but buffered by the sanctuary’s quasi-magical function. The relationship dynamic—her gentle manipulation against his resistance—is strong but could use one more beat of genuine friction or misstep to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliane’s motivation and competence are clear and grounded in her inherited craft, and her actions under pressure follow convincingly from what we know about her. The tie to Gregor via the sextant gives her work emotional and ethical weight. However, internal conflict is muted—she never seriously wavers or struggles emotionally with the cost of what she’s doing—which flattens what could be a richer crucible. The ending reads as an earned stasis, but with relatively low visible cost to her psyche or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s conflict between vocation and family is clear and particular, and Lisel’s resentment feels grounded in specific history (“Too busy with everyone else's family.”). Micro-choices—Mara climbing despite vertigo, sitting on the beam, offering to fix the eye—nicely reveal priorities and regret. The relationship does change in a credible way toward tentative reconnection. The main weakness is how smoothly Lisel pivots toward cooperation; the emotional thorns of years of neglect feel slightly under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s curiosity, stubbornness, and intellectual bent are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in her decision to defy “Do Not Inquire” and physically test the cameo against the undocumented tree. Her interiority feels specific (bathroom breakthroughs, headache from logic) rather than generic. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or risk—she moves from bewildered to accepting the ontological shock with relatively little visible struggle. The final acceptance of inheriting herself into her grandfather is intriguing but emotionally under-contested.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is vivid, competent, and particularized through her relationship to language and the mountain, and the traveler’s recursion is thematically apt, but interior conflict is minimal. She rarely feels genuinely torn or under emotional strain; the rescue unfolds as a demonstration of mastery rather than a pressured gamble. The students are pure function. The final stance—that rescue is about enabling others to find themselves—lands, but with more wisdom than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Isla’s motivation—“recapture what she'd lost” in terms of understanding and identity—is clear and coherently drives her choices, culminating in her stepping into the garden and releasing the card. Interiority is specific and character-particular, especially in how she treats the emerald swatch as an anchor against memory drift. The twins are mostly conceptual presences rather than active relational pressure, so the crucible is more self vs. self than living relationship. Emotional conflict (recapture vs. release of selfhood) is strong but remains slightly abstracted rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marin is clearly motivated, professionally particular, and her methods and curiosity plausibly drive every turn. However, she faces little sustained internal contradiction or emotional turbulence; her adaptability and competence carry her through without much visible struggle. The final act of rebraiding feels intellectually earned but emotionally low-cost, more fulfillment than sacrifice. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet as layered or self-divided as the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mapkeeper is sharply drawn through vocation, body (ripple-mark tattoos), and inherited tool, and her actions clearly follow from a lifelong relationship with the caves. Her competence and sensory particularity feel grounded rather than generic. However, internal contradiction and real ambivalence under pressure are minimal—she wants something, goes to get it, and largely succeeds without a strong clash of impulses. The closing realization feels earned but not costly in a way that would deepen her character further.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mera’s motives and worldview are sharply drawn—her obsession with pattern, history of being dismissed, and quiet stubbornness all feel specific and credible. Her actions (staying, studying the prism, deciding to rekindle the beacon) align cleanly with those traits. Internal conflict (hope vs. likely futility, “blessed/cursed”) is present but not deeply stressed in real time; she doesn’t face a hard, immediate trade-off on the page. The final readiness to act is earned but carries only a muted sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris is sharply etched through vocation, worldview, and the tension between her urgency to record and her acceptance that “permanence is a lie.” Her preemptive nostalgia and philosophical rigor feel specific rather than generic, and her methods (measuring shadows, summer-quill notebook) externalize her inner life. Internal stakes could tighten further around a single sharp dilemma or misgiving under pressure, but her micro-choices and reflections are cohesive. Davin functions effectively as a foil, though he exerts limited direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is vivid, purposeful, and professionally specific, with her wandering, chant, and pyrotechnic craft all coherently feeding her motives. Her motivation to combat hopelessness is clear and consistent, and the commander gives a minimal but functional relational counterpoint. What’s missing for a higher score is real internal contradiction or visible personal cost—Mara never seriously doubts, wavers, or pays more than the abstract price of moving on. The emotional axis stays relatively simple: capable healer meets wound, applies art, departs.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei and Lin are sharply etched in a small space: Mei’s observational, sideways-thinking nature and Lin’s quiet resolve feel particular and credible, and their emotional positions evolve in scene. The professional detail (tidal-pool chronicler) informs Mei’s psychology rather than sitting as décor. The core change—Mei reframing Lin’s “leaving” as inhabiting a transition—is well motivated by what we’ve seen of her. The only slight limitation is that Mei’s internal conflict (wanting to hold vs. needing to release) could surface in one more embodied, pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lina’s motives are clear, consistent, and rooted in a vivid backstory: bunkers/claustrophobia vs. the sky garden and her obsession with silences. Her particular way of perceiving quiet gives her interiority specificity beyond stock feelings. However, her internal conflict in the present scene (risk, fear, doubt) is under-dramatized; things come relatively easily once she’s on the trellis. The final conceptual shift about enclosure vs openness feels earned but lightly priced emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara is sharply drawn through practiced ritual, observational habits, and her calibrated use of silence; the young man is sketched economically but credibly. Her motivation—stewarding others through grief via curated quiet—is specific and consistent. The emotional progression in the scene (his decelerating panic, her measured interventions) feels embodied without resorting to label-speak. The one limitation is that Mara’s own inner conflict is muted; she reads more as a fully arrived guide than someone paying a visible ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vess’s vocation and values are clear and consistent, and her final refusal to sit the throne is motivated by her established identity as a lore keeper rather than a ruler. However, she remains somewhat archetypal, with limited contradiction or deep interior conflict on the page. Emotion is present but often summarized (“she felt tears on her cheeks”) rather than fully embodied in a character-specific way. The arc lands, but it could bear more visible struggle or temptation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya is sharply etched: the self-made exile whose meticulous “tender” destruction masks deep damage, and her ambivalence when Sienna arrives feels earned. Sienna is sketched more economically but still reads as a specific kind of suffocated over-connected person. The final choice—to let Sienna in and begin teaching—flows cleanly from earlier traits and costs Maya her hard-won isolation. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page (resentment vs desire for connection) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s mix of gullibility-scarred pragmatism and lingering hope is clear and specific; the pyramid scheme past and her comfort with pressure motivate her volunteering credibly. Interiority is concrete (“weathered hands,” rebuilding herself like the mushrooms) and not stock. However, the peak choice comes a bit too cleanly; we don’t see much live hesitation, fear, or contradictory impulse at the moment she offers herself. The eternal, bodily cost of fusing with the bolt could be more emotionally contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—to solve the generational mystery and test her intuition about her great-grandfather—is clear and consistently pursued, and her quiet, observant temperament is well embodied (“eloquently silent,” careful note-taking, watching the waves). Her emotional movement from burdened guilt to a more complex, grateful absolution feels earned by the discoveries. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she has already “ended” the dynasty yet still feels responsible to its story, which could be made more overt under pressure. The lack of any on-page relational crucible slightly limits the depth of revealed flaws and values.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The knight’s grief, isolation, and wary hope are well embodied in both physical sensation (“shivering bliss…through her bones”) and concrete choices (withdrawing to the greenhouse, then choosing to speak the oath again). Her motivation—to find a bearable form of living with what happened and maybe touch the lost liege—is consistently dramatized rather than told. The internal shift from withdrawal to a renewed, risk-embracing allegiance to possibility feels earned. The one limit is that contradictory impulses (terror vs desire) could be staged in a more directly conflicted micro-choice rather than mostly coexisting as parallel descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sarah’s grief, methodical temperament, and emerging moral drive are rendered with concrete, character-specific detail (dust as text, the softening letters), and her final decision feels like a credible extension of those traits. Internal contradiction is quiet but present: withdrawing into records vs. choosing to engage actively with these forgotten lives. The emotional palette stays embodied rather than labeled. A slightly sharper on-page struggle between her own loss and this new purpose could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives and competence are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in her decoding of the puddle map and choice to transmit under immediate threat. Interiority is specific (“comfortable tyranny of indifference”) rather than generic, and actions align tightly with her long-term goal. However, she faces little visible internal conflict or irrationality under stress—her resolve is almost too clean—which flattens complexity slightly. The closing stance (“holding the line until enough people remembered how to care”) feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivations are clear and specific—habitual dawn playing, then the pull of memory and inherited duty—and her realization of the grandmother’s legacy credibly drives her final choice. Interiority is nicely embodied (hands trembling on brass, the way she hears space as much as sound), and her fear versus responsibility conflict reads on the page. The shift from harbor busker to guardian of the hush feels earned, though the emotional cost of abandoning the pier life could be shaded a bit more concretely. Overall, she reads as a particular person, not a type, with consistent sensory obsessions and values.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miren is sharply sketched through tactile competence, ritualized eccentricity, and a long-term obsession that clearly drives every choice. Her motivation to decode the leaves is consistent and credible, and her decision to experiment with the moonstone and then build the monument tracks cleanly from what we know of her. The interiority is specific and embodied (sorting by texture, tasting spring) but leans toward a single throughline rather than showing much contradictory impulse. The final transformation feels earned, though the emotional cost of shedding an old self could be shaded more keenly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ellis’s curiosity, professional mindset, and relationship with uncertainty are clear and consistent, and her choice to leave the shrine intact is credible and motivated. Interiority is specific enough (“uncertainly certain,” her approach to planning) to feel character-particular rather than generic. However, conflicting impulses under pressure (e.g., fear vs. drive, desire to solve vs. respect for mystery) are gestured at more than dramatized in-scene, so her internal tension never quite peaks. The final renunciation is earned but could register with sharper on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s guilt, professional identity as a “balanced alchemist,” and need to atone for Kael’s disappearance are clear and consistently motivating, and her sacrifice of the wedding ring lands as a concrete, value-revealing choice. Kael, though mostly off-stage, reads as more than a device thanks to the remembered question about his name and the changed state on his return. Internal conflict (duty to balance vs desperate love/guilt) is present but could be more actively dramatized in the decision beat; she moves to the ritual with relatively little on-page hesitation. The final realization about names is emotionally earned but leans toward a tidy articulation rather than fully conflicted ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s vocation, history with her daughter, and ethos as “shepherd of the wandering” create a clear, specific motivation that coheres with her tactics in the gorge. Her emotional life is present and embodied via tools (harp, tooth) and perceptions rather than labels. Internal contradiction (fear vs. modest fearlessness, grief vs. joy) is implied more than dramatized in real-time micro-choices, which slightly limits depth. Still, her choices with the ghost feel well-motivated and earn the quiet change at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid, particular, and embodied—her hatred of her enhancements, compulsive gestures, and obsessive equation-making all feel rooted in lived trauma. The contradictions (needing the enhanced proprioception she despises; seeking “mathematics of mercy” in a place that re-triggers her) are strong. A touch of diagnostic/therapy language (“trauma responses,” “proprioceptive enhancements”) slightly flattens immediacy in peak moments. Her final, quieter acceptance is earned, though it comes close to being stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to recover her erased grandmother’s legacy and challenge the Guild’s curated history—is clear and coherently expressed through her choices (seeking the lens, decoding the paintings, planning to confront the Council). Interiority is specific enough to feel personal (“elusively tangible,” her throat tightening) rather than generic. However, there is little real internal contradiction or visible cost; she never seriously hesitates or fears what opposing the Guild might mean. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-friction, keeping this just below a truly standout character study.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus is sharply sketched through occupational habits and his ceiling-obsession, and the ghost’s motivation is clean and poignant. His special sight plus his compulsion to investigate hidden spaces naturally drive his choices. However, his internal conflict is understated—he encounters little genuine psychological or ethical friction, which keeps this from feeling fully character-crucible-level. The final reflection is earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Margritte and Tessian are sharply sketched with clear, non-generic motivations—her drive to rupture perfection and his investment in predictive harmony are distinct and credible. However, interior conflict is minimal: Margritte never seems genuinely torn or at risk of failing, and Tessian’s shift from resistance to wonder happens quickly and without much felt ambiguity. Emotional states are mostly conveyed through stance and dialogue rather than embodied, idiosyncratic perception. The final “choice” feels more like an inevitability of the premise than a costly, character-driven turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Matthias is specific and compelling—a spent revolutionary turned elegist-scholar—with a clear throughline from past revolt to present devotion. His motives (vindicating the erased builders, atoning for a failed revolution) are legible and consistent, and his choices (staying, working alone, writing in verse) align. Internal contradiction (fervor vs exhaustion, scholar vs revolutionary) is present but more implied than actively dramatized in on-page dilemmas. The ending’s stance—continuing as an elegist rather than rejoining any collective fight—reads as an earned, quiet renunciation, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cornelius is sharply etched—a truth-afflicted craftsman whose vocation and inheritance feel specific and lived-in. His reverence for the covenant and the stone gives him a distinct interiority, and his methodical work reads as a series of small, meaningful choices. However, the “wilts near dishonesty” flaw never faces a concrete on-page test, so internal contradiction and visible cost remain underdeveloped. The arc is more about enacting his settled nature than about any pressured change in him.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara feels specific and grounded—her mix of industrial chemistry, rain-obsession, and psychometry is distinctive, and her shift from commodification to reverence is clearly motivated. The interiority is concrete and sensorial rather than abstract. Internal conflict is relatively mild; she moves toward the lagoon’s pull with little resistance, so contradiction under pressure is more implied than dramatized. The final renunciation (leaving the compass, accepting mystery) is well earned but not paid for with strongly foregrounded cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iris’s characterization as a craft-obsessed, quietly dogged sculptor is clear and specific, with her “perpetual quest” and respect for structure nicely rooted in the opening details. Her interiority is grounded in her vocation rather than generic reflection, and her openness to being taught by the slide feels consistent with that trait. The weakness is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or genuine emotional struggle; she shifts from storm anxiety to near-reverent acceptance very smoothly, with limited visible cost or resistance. The final stance change is credible but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s personality—vivid publicly, quieter in her recent work—is specific and consistent, and her hands-on way of thinking feels believable. Her motivation (answering the grandmother’s question and finishing the mural) is clear and carries through to the final choice to paint the pavilion glass. Internal conflict is present but mild; the scientific-vs-subtle understanding tension resolves a bit too smoothly, with little felt cost. Still, the closing shift in how she understands herself and her grandmother reads earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya is sharply etched as a solemn archivist whose guarded professional distance is challenged by the retrocognitive experience, and her panic-then-commitment reads credibly. Elijah and the sheriff each get just enough specificity to feel like people rather than roles, especially in the parley scene. The internal contradiction—archival neutrality vs. moral obligation—is present, but her final shift to full advocacy happens quickly and could bear a touch more on-page ambivalence or cost. Still, micro-choices (convincing the captain, landing, arranging her own debris message) track well with her evolving motives.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist’s core motive—rejecting false escape in favor of a harder, truer transformation—is clear and consistent from the refusal of her wish through to shattering the bottle. Interiority is specific and tied to vocation (“working memory,” “mind’s crucible”), though we rarely see genuine hesitation or contradictory impulses in-scene. Her endurance and renunciation (staying alone, taking on the burden of rebuilding) are credible but emotionally under-dramatized. The final stance feels earned, but the psychological cost could be more embodied to reach a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Miriam’s vocation, sensory relationship to the trees, and reflective intelligence feel specific and grounded, and her decision to speak first the “correct” rhyme then the mistaken prophecy is nicely character-revealing. Her motivation (to understand and to keep vows/records) is clear and consistently expressed. The internal shift from dread to “transition” is earned but relatively low-friction, with limited contradictory impulse on the page. A touch more visible cost or ambivalence at the end would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific: grief, rage, inherited duty, and the burden of a dangerous gift all inform her choice. “Furiously tranquil” is embodied rather than merely stated, especially in her steady hands and controlled refusal. The renunciation at the end—letting the thieves keep the stolen futures—is earned by the prior weighing of costs. The main limitation is that her internal conflict around actually sacrificing her grandmother’s life’s work could be shaded with a touch more irrationality or contradiction to feel fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s curiosity, methodical observation, and modest social position are clearly rendered, and her pivotal choice (bell rope over sirens) grows credibly out of those traits. Interiority is concrete (notebooks, tactile engagement with the rope) rather than abstract labels. However, her internal conflict in the key moment—hesitating over the siren switch—could be more textured, with sharper sense of doubt, fear of being wrong, or consequences for defiance. The cost of her stance remains largely conceptual rather than emotionally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael is specific, embodied, and consistently motivated: the “cosmic janitor” whose exile after loss shapes his ritualistic watching. His spiritual curiosity is dramatized in micro-choices (charcoal instead of machines, empathizing with meteors, attention to the flawed glass). The internal turn from “penance” and “broken” to valuing cracks as letting light through is coherent and earned by prior beats, though the realization is a bit tidy. A touch of cliché in the “cracks let the light through” framing slightly blunts the otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas is sharply sketched as a self-exiled, silence-keeping recluse whose habits (wax-sealing windows, obsessive inventory) feel specific and earned. His aversion to words as “weapons” is thematically rich, and his gradual willingness to engage with the ghost and the box tracks cleanly. However, his internal conflict is more articulated than dramatized; we’re told he chose isolation but see little moment-to-moment resistance or ambivalence when accepting the covenant. The final acceptance costs him in principle (taking on memory as burden) but the emotional struggle could be felt more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus’s motivation as a “borrowed-time timekeeper” is clear and particular, and his sense of responsibility versus bewilderment comes through in concrete choices (collecting objects, climbing the silo, fitting the urn). However, internal contradiction is relatively mild—he rarely feels genuinely torn or pushed into a messy trade-off. Emotional texture is present (“measuring hours in heartbeats and memories”) but remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied under pressure. The final decision to teach Chen’s methods feels earned but carries only a lightly sketched cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya is specific, grounded in routine and philosophy, and the young man’s grief-driven block is credible, with his micro-choices (sitting, handling the feather, managing the kite) tracking his inner shift. The mentor-figure dynamic is clear and consistent. However, his interiority remains somewhat generic—“my sister died, and everything came out wrong”—and we don’t feel much contradiction or messy ambivalence in him at the peak moments. The final “Can I come back tomorrow?” step toward healing is earned but a touch tidy, with limited visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and consistent—terminal prognosis + desire for meaningful work—and her methodical curiosity drives all the key choices. Her “brazen calm” feels specific and earned by the diagnosis, and her decisions (to stay, to experiment, to call a successor) are coherent. Internal contradiction is relatively muted; once she chooses the island, she rarely struggles on the page with fear, regret, or doubt. Emotional experience is more summarized than embodied, keeping this just short of truly exceptional characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira is sharply sketched—“luminous in her skepticism,” academically exiled, both wounded and compelled—and her choice to return to the tower with a quasi-experimental mindset is well motivated. The internal contradiction between rationalism and the visitors’ quasi-mystical chemistry runs through the piece and resolves into an earned reorientation at the end. Her emotional responses tend to be elegantly summarized (“her heart performing its own chemistry”) rather than messily dramatized, which slightly mutes the sense of cost. Still, the final shift in what her skepticism illuminates feels credibly rooted in what’s come before.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Erasmus’s vocation, heritage, and quiet sense of duty are clear and particular, and his actions (listening to birds, choosing where to seed) align with those motives. Interiority is restrained but specific—his translations, linguistic obsessions, and reverence for the reef people all feel individuated rather than stock. The main limitation is a near-total absence of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he never seems truly torn or under emotional pressure. The final stance (leaving the jetty to its work) is convincing but costs him little on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Finder is sharply sketched: the veteran tracker whose body-memory of landscapes and corpses now grates against her desire for quiet, and this contradiction motivates her choice to leave safety for Crow. Her professional habits (reading grooves by touch, scanning objects) double as emotional tells, which grounds her competence in character. Crow is thinner but still specific enough—older, grayer, voice rough—to register as a real history partner rather than a device. The main limitation is that her internal conflict on the journey itself is summarized (“her old skills returning”) rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kira’s motivation—to stay, observe, and transform exile into exploration—is clear and consistently rooted in the grandmother’s teaching and the pariah status. Her interiority is specific and embodied (the warm metal, the charcoal, the sketching), but internal conflict is underplayed; there’s little live tension between loneliness and chosen solitude. The crystallizing line “Her motivation had crystallized: to turn confusion into exploration” feels a touch declarative instead of fully dramatized. The final stance—curiosity as true north—is earned but leans more toward affirmation than costly contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Seren’s motivation—to repair the sky and live up to her mentor’s trust—is clear and consistent, and her thief/keeper duality is nicely embedded in her choices. Her internal conflict about possibly making the wrong swaps is present but resolved a bit too cleanly, with little degradation or irrationality under peak stress. Interiority is specific enough (“trembled not from cold but from understanding”) to feel embodied rather than generic. The final shift from apprentice to keeper is earned, though the cost of that growth could be shaded more ambivalently.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s core motivation and contradiction are vivid—her shift from rehearsed disasters to archiving “small survivals” feels specific and earned, and the line “She was cruel because she was kind” lands as a credible articulation of her method. Her actions (claiming the gallery, inventing the walking archive, pushing survivors) are aligned with that drive. The main limitation is that her emotional cost is mostly conceptualized rather than dramatized in a focused, in-the-moment beat, so we feel her role more than we feel her breaking under it.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Isla’s grief, dissociation, and eventual acceptance are rendered with clear, specific interiority, and her final pivot—choosing to seed a new tactile book of home—feels motivated by what we’ve seen. The coping mechanism of rewriting memories via mercury glass is strong and character-particular. However, her internal conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, so contradictory impulses don’t quite clash on the page at peak moments. The epiphany around belonging lands a bit smoothly, with minimal visible struggle in the deciding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is specific, embodied, and plausibly flawed—her pride, exile, and chess-trained cognition all show up in her choices and perceptions. The exile backstory is efficiently tied to her present drive, and her confession at the tapestry feels earned rather than arbitrary. However, her internal resistance to self-forgiveness is relatively smooth and under-contested on the page, so contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in live conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—defiant artist trying to complicate a moral reckoning—and the late realization that the canyon has only amplified the core truth feels earned. Her internal conflict (intention vs consequence, art vs harm) is woven throughout rather than tacked on. However, the emotional experience stays mostly conceptual; there’s limited embodied, sensory reaction to the girl’s death or to her own impending suffering, which slightly blunts depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s fear, self-soothing narration habit, and inherited philosophy from her grandmother create a specific, textured psyche under pressure. Her uncertainty is dramatized (especially with the final vial) rather than merely labeled. The main limitation is that her shift at the end edges toward tidy insight, with less felt cost than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motivation—avoiding intimacy and pain by staying an observer—is clear and consistently dramatized, from the broken mirror to her habitual distance in painting. Her internal conflict between aloofness and desire to “live inside” moments is convincingly forced into a choice in the cave, where she ruins her clothes and sits in the water. The final knock on the gallery door and her line about needing to paint something she’s inside of feels earned by earlier beats rather than tacked on. The main limitation is that some emotional states are summarized rather than embodied under peak pressure, slightly softening the complexity of her contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific, with a clear contradiction between her habit of loudness and her buried tenderness, and the vial sequence dramatizes that conflict convincingly. Her emotional state is embodied (“breath rattling like shells in a bucket,” the calcified feeling in her chest) rather than labeled. Vera is sketched but legible, and her wary arrival then crumpling response feels psychologically plausible at this scale. The reconciliation is a touch neat, but it still reads as earned by the seven-year cost and Mara’s vulnerable choice.

    Mara’s motivation—guiding the lost as rehearsal and hope for finding her daughter—is clear, specific, and coherently embodied in her methods. Her competence and her grief co-exist persuasively, though internal contradiction under direct pressure is more implied than dramatized. The small physical choices (touching the maps, the censer foot, the window) all track cleanly with her emotional state. I’d push this higher if we saw one moment where her need for her daughter tangibly complicates or distorts how she handles a caller.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation—craving privacy and psychological safety despite enforced empathy—is vivid and consistent, and her methodical, solitary professionalism grounds her. The neighbor anecdote sharply dramatizes her involuntary truthfulness and its cost. Internal conflict between rational caution and desperate loneliness is clear, though it could surface a bit more in the immediate moment of choosing to use the eye. Overall, the final decision feels well-earned by prior interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margit is clearly motivated by professional duty and a deeper need to understand grief, and her final act of releasing the flower is credibly earned. The lighthouse-keeper lens and her habit of “observing gaps” give her a distinct interiority. However, her inner conflict at the end is relatively smooth; there’s limited sense of true resistance to letting the memories go. A touch more contradiction in her desire to keep/banish Ernst’s memories would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is clear, specific, and his solitude, craft, and inherited obligation all feel grounded, with the antique-map detail giving him texture. His core contradiction—comfort in isolation vs the burden of an unkept promise—is present but could be dramatized more viscerally in the decision beat. The final choice to open the door is motivated and legible, but the emotional cost of leaving his existing life is more implied than felt. A bit more embodied conflict at the hinge moment would push this into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The queen’s disenchantment, weariness with power, and stubborn agency are clearly established and consistently drive her choices, especially in leaving alone and demanding, “What must I do?”. Her interiority is concrete and specific (“fragile, fracturing—and felt nothing but distant concern”), and her change to purpose at the end feels earned by what she’s witnessed. The relationship with the old woman has clear status dynamics and mutual testing, though their exchange edges toward neatness rather than genuine friction. Emotional contradiction could be pushed a bit further at the climax, where her shift toward purpose happens relatively smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives (profit/ambition vs presence/connection) and Kael’s quiet endurance are clear and specific, and her choice to stay and reorient her work feels earned. The friendship has texture—shared history, gentle teasing, a gift that mattered—but their internal contradictions are resolved rather quickly and cleanly. Emotional reactions are mostly embodied and particular (“tears tracked silver,” hand to the spiral) rather than generic. The main limitation is that neither character is allowed to be truly messy or wrong on the page; conflict is morally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is rich, specific, and textured; her jealousy of past selves, “jaded wonder,” and need to impose narrative order feel psychologically sharp and consistent. Her professional past as a dream chronicler is integrated into how she perceives and responds to her current fracture, giving her motives depth. The piece lands on Earned Stasis—she recommits to chronicling despite the futility—with a felt cost in loneliness and exhaustion. I’d push toward even higher if a single on-page choice under pressure (beyond continuing to write) more sharply dramatized a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is specific (reading clients’ faces after losing smell) and her arc from mourning to reframing loss is coherent and motivated by on-page interaction with Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen is sketched with economical, concrete traits (verdigris-stained fingers, midwife mother, repurposed tools) that reveal values through action. The main weakness is that her epiphany lands quickly and cleanly, with little visible resistance or contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and embodied—the trembling hands, the silver scars, the crystallizing breath—and their shift from shame to ownership is clearly motivated by concrete memories and present pressure. Contradictory impulses (hide scars vs. use them as truth) are visible in action rather than merely stated. The final choice to inscribe the scar-pattern as a rune feels earned and forecloses the old self-erasing path. If anything, the emotional resolution is a touch too clean for an elite venue, with little lingering mess or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira and Derrick are sharply etched, with a credible shared history and conflicting impulses (remorse, defensiveness, lingering affection) playing simultaneously in scene. Her admission that she weaponized the column to force connection is both specific and damning, and his refusal to forgive while still valuing her presence feels psychologically true. The grandmother and career backstory meaningfully shape Mira’s present choices rather than explaining them away. Complexity is high, though there’s a slight risk of over-articulation in thematic lines like “imperfect miracles” that edges toward authorial framing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—unraveling cosmic illusions—is clear and consistent, and his shift from observer to participant is legible and earned. However, his interiority leans toward abstract exposition rather than embodied, character-particular conflict, so contradictory impulses never fully bite on the page. The “end of history witness” identity is intriguing but under-exploited as a source of pressure or flaw. The final realization feels slightly too smooth, with limited sense of emotional or existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s core motivation is clear and specific, and her choices (blowing the whistle, deciding to count backwards, using the key) arise credibly from that drive. Interiority is textured—her fixation on “what clocks really measure” feels character-rooted, not generic. However, internal contradiction and emotional cost are relatively soft; she experiences curiosity more than a genuine struggle between incompatible impulses. The final understanding is earned but a bit tidy, with limited visible emotional fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is sharply drawn—a competent specialist whose history with grief and treatment informs her choices—and Marcus, though briefer, has enough specificity (the daughter, the exhaustion) to feel real. Her central conflict (duty to protect vs. empathy for another mourner) is clear and resolved by a concrete choice with implied professional risk. The interiority around “permeable barriers” and grief is particular to her worldview, not generic. The one softness is that her final decision feels a touch too easy and fast for the stakes invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific—her mix of intellectual rigor, hurt, and cautious hope feels lived-in, and the father is vividly etched through his notebooks and contradictions. Her micro-choices (lingering over the scrawls, drafting a new kind of syllabus, deciding to bring the notebooks to rehab) track cleanly with her motivation. The enduring contradiction—loving and critiquing her father while wanting to correct his blind spots—remains productively unresolved rather than neatly fixed. The only slight limitation is that her internal conflict in the present moment never quite hits a sharp, pressured fork; it stays contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iris’s vocation and underlying motivation are clear and consistent, and her small tactical choices (what to ask, when to intervene, who to call later) track well with that core. However, she reads almost wholly as benevolent function rather than a fully conflicted person; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or emotional cost to her interventions. The brief grandmother backstory adds texture but not much psychological depth. At this length, one moment of real doubt or misgiving on Iris’s part would have significantly deepened characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s grief, avoidance, and vocation are braided into a coherent, specific psyche, and her final shift from penance to affirmation feels earned by the locket’s arrival and the jetty ritual. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. euphoria, preservation vs. avoidance—are dramatized rather than merely named. Embodied responses (trembling fingers, sensory attention to ink and roses) keep emotion grounded. The only slight limitation is how smoothly her realization crystallizes, with little on-page resistance at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera is sharply drawn: hyper-competent, performatively flippant, and privately lonely, with the mask-drop at the end clearly earned from prior beats. Her motives (solving impossible logistics as a displaced cure for loneliness) are integrated into both action and reflection. The young man is thinner but functions effectively as a foil who crystallizes her misbelief. Contradictory impulses—control vs isolation, jokes vs despair—are present, though the internal conflict could be dramatized with one more moment of real resistance before she softens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives—mapping what she cannot see, seeking the stillpoint after her wife’s death—are clear and specific, and her choices (entering the forest now, trusting the ring, continuing when the melody becomes personal) track well with those motives. Her interiority is grounded in embodied perception (vibration through skin, warmth of the ring) rather than abstract labels. There is a subtle but present contradiction between her need to map and the lesson that grief cannot be charted, which makes the final acceptance feel earned. The main limit is that her internal conflict never quite spikes into a sharply dramatized dilemma; she moves forward with relatively little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s interiority—her guilt over Meridian, fascination with the pen, and gradual reconception of her role—is specific and coherent, and the “confidently uncertain” paradox feels earned. The emotional core (guilt → experimental curiosity → revised self-understanding) tracks cleanly. However, almost all of this is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so we rarely see her make pressured micro-choices in real time. The change at the end is convincing but somewhat essayistic rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—her relationship to the camera, the dock vibrations, and her former identity as a pianist all feel lived—and her shift from mourning to discovery is credibly seeded. Her motivations and contradictions (clinging to remembered sound vs. opening to new rhythms) are clear, though they’re resolved a bit smoothly for this level of pain. Celeste functions effectively as a mentor-foil, but she remains almost entirely wise and composed, with little visible flaw or pressure on her side. The final choice to “disrupt everything they think music is” feels earned but lightly costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motivation—honoring Kiran’s promise and countering erasure—feels specific, sustained, and drives every present-tense choice. Her interiority has strong, concrete touches (“volcanic tenderness,” the way she handles the tapestry and portrait) rather than generic grief. However, her moral and psychological contradictions (arsonist vs conservator, guilt vs righteousness) are largely summarized rather than dramatized under pressure in the moment, keeping her just short of truly layered complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation—to honor and preserve the entangled dead while testing the limits of the treatment—is clear and consistent, and her quietly rebellious streak concretely drives action (sneaking in during forbidden hours, drumming despite medical directives). The interiority is specific and character-particular (the doubled memories, five and eighty-three at once). Internal conflict (comfort in communion vs crushing weight of thirteen lives) is present but could be sharpened under direct pressure instead of staying mostly reflective. The final stance—accepting the role of “guinea pig” as a kind of vocation—feels earned without being pat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is sharply sketched as competent, quietly strategic, and shaped by her father’s organizing, with motives (labyrinth control, truth about the container) that clearly drive her choices. The interiority is efficient rather than deep; we rarely feel true contradiction or frayed edges under pressure. Voss functions well as a status counterpoint but remains mostly a foil. The ending delivers an earned sense of poised agency, though the emotional cost of aiding authority is only lightly touched.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s guilt and paralysis are sharply rendered (“a half-spoken secret lodged in her throat like a stone”), and her decisive confession feels fully motivated by the accumulating pressure and the guardian’s wordless prompting. The internal conflict between shame and the need to save her brother is credible and present in scene, not just summarized. The guardian is more archetype than person, but his choices and gestures are specific and consistent with his role. The final shift—Mara taking up the mirror herself—reads as an earned change with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina is sharply etched: her long-term commitment, sensitivity to unsaid fears, and loneliness give her a distinct inner life and credible motive for the “humble rebellion.” Her ability to hear unspoken words is integrated into perception and choice rather than left as a label. Internal contradiction is present but muted—she rarely seems genuinely torn or afraid, so peak beats feel confident rather than pressured. The children function more as a collective chorus than differentiated individuals, which is fine at this length but keeps relational crucibles fairly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interior is rich and specific: former fighter, now forcibly non-violent, whose remaining “furious love” and grief drive every choice. Her contradiction—weaponized past versus enforced gentleness—plays out credibly in micro-choices like wading out, taking the scrimshaw, and finally letting it go. Emotions are mostly embodied through tactile sea details rather than labels, and the neural dampeners add a concrete constraint on her motivations. The only slight weakness is how quickly her final self-acceptance lands; it edges toward tidy but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is specific, contradictory, and earned: she both toys with self-harm imagery and fixates on reducing wood, not creating, which reveals a complex relationship to grief and agency. The micro-choices—continuing to whittle instead of taking down the bouquet, finally acting without narration—track a believable internal arc. Her detachment and moral ambiguity feel grounded in the world’s history rather than label-only traits. The only slight shortfall is that her relationship to Tom is sketched more conceptually than viscerally, which mutes peak emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyren’s interiority is vivid and consistent—“a tremor of certainty she couldn’t quite grasp” and her cloud-shadow poetics read as particular rather than generic. Her motivation (to reclaim/translate forbidden aesthetics) is clear and drives all her actions in the atrium, but she faces little real internal contradiction or resistance, so the emotional path feels relatively smooth. The final stance—“beauty needed no permission to exist”—is thematically apt yet arrives with limited sense of cost beyond prior exile risk. A touch more friction between fear of the ban’s legacy and her aesthetic hunger would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira and Fen are both clearly motivated and psychologically coherent, with Mira’s colorblindness and Fen’s perfectionism nicely embodied in their actions and artistic choices. Mira’s bartering ethic and quiet confidence give her a specific texture, and Fen’s first smile reads as an earned shift. However, there’s limited on-page internal contradiction or real emotional messiness under pressure; their evolution feels persuasive but gentle. The final barter could carry more visible cost or ambivalence to deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Karim’s arc from clinical detachment to collaborative witness feels motivated by her grief over the project and the bell ringer’s reframing; her micro-choices (letting the stranger work, deciding to rebuild as testimony) track cleanly. The bell ringer is slightly more emblematic than fully individuated, but their history with the memorial bells grounds them. Emotional shifts occasionally move a bit quickly into insight (“connection had texture—rough and smooth...”), but they’re still rooted in on-page experience. The relationship dynamic—her guardedness versus their “powerfully gentle” persistence—does good crucible work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is vivid, with a specific history (Vincent, the failed studio, creditors) and a clear, consistent motivation rooted in transforming grief into craft. Her micro-choices—accepting the unusual commission, the care with ash and silver, the origami response—align with that motive. Internal conflict is mostly past-tense and processed; we see little live contradiction or real temptation to refuse the mother’s request, which keeps this short of fully charged interiority. Still, her worldview feels particular rather than generic, and the closing stance is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation and worldview are sharply drawn—her measuring, documentation, and decision to confide all track cleanly with a pattern-obsessed, intellectually driven temperament. The grandmother’s journal and “inherited mystery” give her a credible lineage and frame her work as both personal and conceptual. However, we rarely see true internal conflict or cost; she is mostly explaining, not struggling, so the emotional stakes of her project remain muted. Tobias functions as a respectful foil rather than a pressure source, so the relationship doesn’t quite become a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maressa’s motivation (forbidden knowledge) is clear, specific, and carried through her micro-choices, from years of study to her final renunciation. The internal conflict between “anguished joy” and dread is credible and embodied (trembling hands, tears under the veil) rather than abstract. Her decisive choice to leave the archive untouched is well earned by the horror she witnesses. The one limitation is that her psychology is largely in one register—driven historian—without many smaller, idiosyncratic contradictions beyond the central thematic one.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is sharply etched through specific habits (the stone, her watching, her language about "topology of hope's erosion") and feels like a real, idiosyncratic mind. Her motivation to document loss rather than intervene is coherent and threads through the piece. However, internal contradiction and live micro-choices under pressure are relatively muted; she reflects more than she’s forced into a real dilemma. The closing act with the stone is evocative but low-cost, so her Earned Stasis lands more intellectually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s interior conflict between exposing the fraud and protecting the animals is concrete, convincing, and consistently drives her micro-choices. Her gentleness is not just told but dramatized in her handling of Prism and the care protocols she drafts. The shift from compliant belief in Adrian to autonomous ethical stance feels earned, though a few lines (“She’d been so fragile in her convictions…”) edge toward summarizing her arc a bit neatly. The absence of Adrian on the page slightly limits the relational crucible but doesn’t undercut her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s guilt, vocation, and fragmented care are specific and credible, and her shift from self-condemnation to reframing the “displaced miracle” feels earned. Interiority is concrete (ivy panic, fern contentment, the scar) rather than abstract labels. The final choice to heal the ivy arises naturally from her accumulated micro-choices and reflections rather than a sudden flip. Slight neatness in the self-forgiveness arc keeps it just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s motive and worldview are clear and particular, with vivid embodied reactions to the film strips and to the final projection. However, her inner life remains largely aligned with the story’s thesis—there’s little contradiction or doubt, and she encounters almost no real resistance. The final decision to release the love is thematically apt but carries limited on-page cost beyond emotional overwhelm. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet at the level of deeply complicated, high-stakes interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and particular (hearing “the longing of stars, the grief of empty spaces”), and her generational inheritance gives her motive real texture. Her goal—to answer the screaming words and open the archway—is clear and drives every choice. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper contradiction under pressure: we don’t quite see competing impulses (terror vs duty, selfish survival vs sacrifice) dramatized in the moment. Her final acceptance as “doorway” feels earned but relatively untroubled, with limited on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guard’s motivation—to restore growth and possibility after the burn—is clear, consistent, and rooted in a concrete loss (the last forest, the loss of dreams). Her choices (opening the archive, singing to it, pressing the clock) align with that drive and reveal a quietly stubborn temperament. What’s missing, at an elite level, is more visible contradiction or internal conflict under pressure; she rarely wants two incompatible things at once. Emotional texture is present but somewhat generalized, so the character feels compelling but not yet fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation—to map the wild frontier of his own mind—is clear, consistent, and well-rooted in his past as a professor turned “stray philosopher.” His interiority is specific enough (e.g., reading environments as texts, reinterpreting the dark iron trees and copper ones) to avoid stock characterization. However, internal conflict is relatively mild; there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost beyond a vague exile from his old life, which keeps this below top-tier literary depth. His final acceptance of the sixth sense feels earned but emotionally under-contested.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motivation and inner life are clear and particular—seventeen years of bedside care, the sense of a “leash,” and her mixture of guilt, grief, and yearning are all well grounded. The micro-arc from constriction to cautious ownership of the ticket punch feels earned. The guides are archetypal rather than individuated, but their functions as midwives of her realization are coherent and consistent. Emotional embodiment leans more on image than on bodily sensation, but it still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marta’s interiority is precise and consistent—her damaged hands, attentiveness to silence, and decision to stay all root in a coherent drive “to understand the cost of safety.” The progression from passive listening to active humming and finally to placing the bolt reads as an earned endurance rather than a sudden revelation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (a non-reverent woman perceived as nun-like); a slightly sharper sense of flaw or self-deception could deepen the arc. Still, her final stance feels motivated and carries a visible cost in quiet defiance of management and the hotel’s ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael is sharply drawn—her age, scale, and vocation all feel specific, and her motivation to preserve truth at the cost of herself is clear and consistent. Interiority is mostly implied through her ritual-like actions and composure rather than dramatized contradiction, so internal conflict stays muted. Her final acceptance of dissolution is earned but emotionally underplayed; we see conviction more than struggle. With no other character on the page, relational pressure is absent, which limits complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya feels specific and embodied—the tapping tic, the history as a bleaching witness, and the shift from “vigil” to discovery give her interiority texture and motive clarity. Her drive to understand the currents is consistent and shapes every action, and the ocean-as-memory idea reads as an organic outgrowth of that obsession. Internal contradiction (grief over loss vs emergent hope) is present but subtly rendered rather than dramatized in a sharp on-page dilemma, which keeps the arc a bit cool. Jin functions mainly as a sounding board, but the brief dynamic is believable and doesn’t flatten Maya.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kira’s interiority is concrete and particular—bare feet on warm concrete, the absurd delicacy of the opera glasses, and her prophet-or-fool uncertainty all feel individualized. Her motivation (to reinterpret the “failed” rebellion) is clear and consistently embodied in her habits and perceptions. The final stance shift toward gathering others is well-motivated by the accumulated scene. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction under live pressure—her doubts and confidence coexist, but they never quite clash on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira is sharply drawn: an aging insurgent whose hunger-triggered plant-sense and history with her daughter generate a specific, credible internal conflict between preservation and destruction. Her motives for following the kite’s clues and ultimately choosing to “midwife what comes next” feel organically earned from those prior contradictions. The moment where she weighs her daughter’s stance against her own is a clean hinge. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top is that her fear or doubt at the unsealing decision could be embodied a little more viscerally before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Layla’s interiority is rich, embodied, and specific, with clear contradictory impulses (urge to dissociate vs. deliberate grounding) playing out in scene, especially around the helicopter pass. Her choices—taking the job, tending the plants, walking to the glass wall, returning to the children—are motivated by a coherent survival ethic and culminate in an earned stasis (“to freeze when she must, then thaw again”). The relationship to Samir, though off-page, feels real and charged via the photograph and casualty count. Slightly clinical phrasing (“somatic markers,” “the body keeps score”) pulls a bit of texture away from pure character-particular thought in a couple of lines.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and specific—her crisis about fractured faces is well-motivated, and her choices with the cards track cleanly with that drive. The blend of professional identity (portrait artist) and existential doubt feels particular, not generic. The main weakness is that her internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly; once she recognizes the pattern, there’s little resistance or contradictory impulse on the page. The final acceptance feels earned but low-cost, more serene revelation than hard-won, torn decision.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and layered: professional obsession as a tracker braided with unresolved grief and a quasi-scientific drive to understand crisis-time. Her “serene anger” and half-feral self-concept give her a distinct interior texture, and her final decision to pursue understanding over simple revenge feels earned. The brother backstory is efficiently tied to the present ink patterns rather than tacked on. Internal contradiction (need for control vs. acceptance of risk) is present but could be dramatized more sharply in on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and specific—her mother’s execution, her years of hesitation, and the pull between fear and duty all track cleanly into the final choice. The professional detail of her being a cryogenic archivist and her inherited ice-reading skills individualize her. The emotional beats lean a bit on abstract phrasing (“bravely conflicted,” “crystallized purpose”) rather than fully embodied contradiction in the peak moment. Still, the final decision feels earned by prior setup, with a visible renunciation of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara and her father are sharply drawn with clear, opposing value systems that feel rooted in history, and his gradual softening is convincingly motivated by her stance and the dome’s atmosphere. His contradictory impulses—the reflexive reach for weapons versus the choice to kneel and plant—play out on the page. Her “engraved quiet” and odd perceptiveness are dramatized rather than labeled. The relationship pivot at the end feels earned and carries emotional cost for him without slipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation (to reclaim her daughter’s voice) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her “cool-headed fisher” temperament comes through in how she navigates cosmic chaos. Interiority is specific—“drowning on dry land,” “teeth ache”—and tied to concrete stakes. Internal contradiction is present but relatively muted: fear vs. composure is stated more than deeply dramatized in competing impulses. The mother–daughter relationship is emotionally potent but the daughter remains more emblem than character on the page, which slightly limits the depth of the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Adelaide’s motivation—truth versus loyalty to her family—is clear, consistent, and escalates credibly from avoidance to decisive action. Her use of philosophical “proof by contradiction” under emotional stress feels character-specific rather than generic cleverness. The internal turn where she realizes she’s protecting reputation instead of truth is well earned and drives the final choice. Marcus is thinner but functions cleanly as a pressure source and ethical mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and textured—ink-stained hands, constellation work, her relationship to sound and translation—so her obsession with the firmware and letters feels motivated. The generational guilt and “untranslatability” give her a credible, flawed misbelief. Her decisive act of breaking the pendant and tattooing herself is well-earned by prior details of her craft and history. The only soft spot is how quickly she systematizes the entire mother–daughter dynamic into an abstract lesson, which slightly smooths over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Isla’s motivation (finding “meaning in the mess”) is clear and consistently embodied in her ritualistic work with the mandala, and the old woman’s grief reads specific rather than generic. Their relationship develops quickly but credibly into a surrogate mother–daughter bond. Internal contradiction is relatively light—Isla moves from uncertainty to recognition without much dramatized struggle—so the final realization, while earned, feels a bit smooth. Still, their micro-choices around the tile and the shared grief give the characters more depth than the word count usually permits.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vessa’s characterization is rich and specific: her “gentle radical” augment choices, her combat past, and her retrocognitive curse all cohere into a believable, internally conflicted person. Her final choice to protect Davos’s myth feels earned by her values and history, not imposed. The embodied details (mechanical fingers, steel palm, joints humming) ground her emotions well. If anything, the labeling of her philosophy (“gentle radical,” “aberrant mercy”) edges toward telling rather than fully dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Celeste is vivid and specific—a stage actress whose hunger for applause survives death and refocuses on saving a stranger, with synesthetic perception shaping how she experiences everything. Her core motivation is clear and consistent, and her choice to perform for the young man’s future rather than for an audience aligns with that drive. However, her interior conflict is relatively muted: the tension between craving applause and seeking quieter impact is implied more than dramatized, and there’s little visible cost to her decision beyond effort and waiting. A sharper sense of what she risks or forecloses (e.g., missing other chances, destabilizing her haunt) would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya and Iris both feel particular and embodied—the skeptical caretaker and the damaged former telepath are rendered through specific habits, somatic sensations, and micro-choices. Motivation is clear and consistent (Maya’s need to help Iris even after “I told you so,” Iris’s grief-tinged yearning for lost pathways). Internal contradiction shows up in Maya’s mix of affection and frustration, but this tension could have been pushed harder at the key turn (the decision to experiment) for an even richer crucible. The final endurance—living with Iris’s incurable state while choosing to turn loss into a tool for others—reads earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s vocation, loneliness, and dawning sense of a new role are clear and specific, and her habits (touching the fossil, returning to these caves) embody her interior state. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized (“had come to understand”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. She rarely faces real-time pressure that forces a hard choice; her endurance feels thoughtful but low-friction. The final stance is emotionally coherent but could land harder if her liminal role cost her something concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is vivid and particular—her tactile way of reading buttons as emotions and choices gives her a strong interior signature. Her motivation (to interrogate a prophecy that has constrained her life) is clear and coherently drives each step. What’s thin is on-page ambivalence and cost: she moves from doubt to action with little visible resistance, and the price of defying a culturally central prophecy is mostly conceptual. The arc convinces but feels smoothed rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Claire’s motives are clear and specific—guilt, loyalty to the dead handler, and fear disguised as wisdom—culminating in a believable choice to re-enter danger. Her interiority has some vivid, character-particular touches (“unused courage…waiting here all along”), but the internal conflict is relatively clean rather than genuinely messy or self-contradictory. The relationship with Marcus is sketched efficiently yet could bear more tension or unresolved history to really function as a crucible. The final decision feels earned, though some self-explanation (“calling cowardice by prettier names”) edges toward thematic gloss rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Both characters are clearly motivated and individualized—the coachman’s long-learned patience and the woman’s desperation/filial conflict read cleanly, and his attentiveness catalyzes her shift. However, her inner life is sketched more than deeply dramatized, with little on-page contradiction beyond “desperate yet receptive.” The final lightness in her step feels earned but comes with minimal visible cost or lingering ambivalence. This is strong, but not yet at the psychologically intricate level expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The potter’s motivation is clear from the outset and stays coherent: she comes to understand why this place resists entropy, and her choices (to observe, to tend, to stay, to leave) all spring credibly from that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied in craft language (“learned zen through clay,” “the wheel’s rhythm”) rather than generic reflection. Her conceptual shift about care layering into time feels earned by accumulated observations, not hand-waved. The main limitation is that internal conflict remains muted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost beyond time and effort.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is clearly and consistently motivated—her bond with her grandmother, the promise tied to the last petal, and her commitment to the kids all align. The “wistfully pragmatic” stance is embodied in how she both accepts loss and takes risk, though her internal conflict about “hiding” versus exposure is mostly stated rather than dramatized under pressure. The children function as a collective rather than individuals, so relational crucible pressure is soft. The ending’s shift into “locksmiths of a different kind” feels earned but relatively low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation—to turn isolation into independence—is clear, consistent, and threads through the beats, and her fear/avoidance of the cartography wing gives her a concrete internal obstacle. Interiority is specific enough to feel like a distinct person rather than a cipher, especially in her relationship to extinction and displacement. However, her final shift from avoidance to acceptance feels slightly too smooth; we get more stated realization than messy, embodied conflict in the moment of choice. The emotional cost is present conceptually but could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei Lin’s vocation, habits, and quiet shift from hoarder of others’ words to teacher of them feel specific and earned, and Jun’s presence usefully refracts her arc. Her motivation to “find the thread that connects all things” is dramatized through small, concrete choices (saving letters, then physically tying them to the spiral). The main weakness is that her internal conflict plays out with minimal friction or resistance; there’s little sense she might truly choose to keep the letters. Emotional contradictions are present but resolved rather tidily for an elite-market piece.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her professional lens colors what she notices. We get embodied stress (teeth ache, vision blur, bone-deep vibration) and a credible mix of fear and determination. Internal contradiction—her “cautious hope” versus the scale of the risk—is present but only lightly dramatized. Secondary characters exist purely offstage, so relational pressure on her is mostly inferred rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (finding the key) and core contradiction (claustrophobic yet drawn to impossible spaces) are clear and consistently dramatized. Her fear is embodied (“tight bands constricting her chest”) and actively opposes her goal. The final comfort she takes in space’s “rebellion” grows credibly from that conflict. The piece could reach higher if we saw one more flawed or irrational choice under pressure rather than essentially optimal behavior throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s interiority is specific and interesting—her prosopagnosia and portrait practice create a distinctive perceptual world, and her non-justice motivation (“paint…mercy”) is a strong, character-particular drive. Her methodical reconstruction of the scene and the way she reads posture and gesture rather than faces feel embodied and consistent. The main limit is that we rarely see her under real emotional strain or contradiction; she moves from fascination to insight with little on-page friction or self-doubt. The final choice to portray the killer through “negative space” is earned but lands as relatively unopposed, more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motives (legacy, truth-telling) are clear and consistent, and her embodied nervousness plays well against her determination. Dr. Yoon is sketched efficiently as bitter yet still ethically engaged. However, internal contradiction under pressure is light—no real moment where Mira’s fear or doubt nearly derails her choice. The final decision to publish coded stanzas comes a bit too easily, with little visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maria is sharply sketched—her occupation, observational skill, and values are concrete, and her choice to become a witness through song is consistent with what we’ve learned. However, internal conflict is light: she moves from shock to acceptance and purpose with little on-page resistance or cost. Emotional texture is present but rarely contradictory in the moment. The hitchhiker is more symbol than character, which is fine for the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Luka’s psychology is sharply drawn: the son of a literal highway robber who’s replicated predation in a corporate register is a potent, specific flaw. His motivation to interrogate his own pattern and the choice to stay with the discomfort rather than flee feels earned by the accumulation of memories and realizations. The interior conflict between admiration for his father’s honesty and horror at his own rationalizations lands well, though the final resolve edges toward tidiness. The lack of other on-page characters keeps the crucible purely internal but still effective at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira and Kove are clearly motivated—her by deciphering the inscriptions, him by guilt over Chen—and their choices (inviting him to sit, deciding to collaborate) arise credibly from those motives. The dynamic between them evolves from guarded distance to genuine partnership, with Chen’s absence functioning as a third character. However, Mira veers toward idealized healer, with little contradictory impulse on the page, and some emotional beats feel summarized (“there was something in her voice that made healing tangible”) rather than embodied. The change at the end is convincing but relatively low-cost, keeping this short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s competence, guardedness, and specific gift are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized, especially in the line “This was the price of her gift—to find lost things, she had to lose herself temporarily.” Internal conflict is present but relatively low-key; she never seriously wavers, so the “warlike serenity” is more stated than pressure-tested. The cost of unbending her defenses is conceptually strong but could be more viscerally embodied in the climax. Still, her final endurance—a return to guardedness after necessary vulnerability—feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives (guilt over ignored warnings, hope for the Intersection) are clear and embodied in specific objects like the clipping and the wheelchair, and her choice to come and then to define their role gives her a modest arc. However, her interior conflict remains relatively thin—she moves from anxious to affirmed without much real doubt or contradiction on the page. Chen and the others function more as symbolic types than as pressured individuals, which flattens relationship dynamics. The final acceptance (“We were never meant to stop the future…”) feels earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s idealism, guilt, and need to “patch holes in the soul” are well-motivated and consistently dramatized, and Kael’s anger and grief feel grounded in specific loss. The relationship functions as a crucible: his demand forces her to reassess her entire project and make a costly choice. Interiority is concrete but occasionally leans on summary lines instead of letting contradiction play out in scene. Still, the final decision to try to undo the trade is credibly earned by prior traits and history.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is sharply drawn: the ex-roadie turned expert whose identity is shaken by public failure, now clinging to facts as a shield. His interiority is concrete and particular (road smells, load-outs, the feel of grille cloth), and his micro-choices—avoiding eye contact, then deciding to look at the woman and soften the blow—reveal layered motives. The contradiction between his need for certainty and his compassion for the daughter is credible and drives the scene. The final choice to tack the cloth up and keep working feels like an earned, costly endurance rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Asha’s motivation (finishing Dalmar’s work, transforming grief into understanding) is clear and consistent, and her kindly, methodical temperament is well dramatized through the repeated, careful seed attempts. Interiority is specific—her preference for “spirit left” over clinical language, her comfort in the Arbor’s hum—but her emotional conflict stays fairly clean (patient scholar vs. grief) without much contradiction or self-sabotage. The final realization about transition is earned by her actions and study, though the cost of that insight (what she loses or risks emotionally) could be more sharply embodied. Relationship with Dalmar is affecting but mostly retrospective; we don’t see their dynamic under real-time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motives (tending the library, seeking stable pages, preserving wonder) are clear and consistent, and her role as heir to her grandmother’s work gives her specificity. The internal arc from anxious disruption to accepting a world without tomorrow is coherent but relatively smooth, with little dramatized hesitation or contradictory impulse under pressure. Emotional texture is more contemplative than fraught, so the final shift feels earned conceptually more than viscerally costly. Still, her identity reconfiguration into “librarian and fisher both” is a credible, character-rooted change.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s duty-versus-awakening conflict is clear and consistent, and her final choice to classify the bunker as “culturally significant” is well motivated by what she discovers. Her interiority is concrete and character-specific (the way she reads, interprets, and finally adds a shell). The main weakness is that her emotional transformation from detached inspector to participant happens quickly and is mediated largely through interpretation rather than richly embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s guilt, professional precision, and avoidance are clearly etched, and her choice to return, play the accordion, and re-map herself feels earned. The interiority is specific (river data as penance) rather than generic grief. The internal conflict between control (maps, inspections, medication) and surrender (playing badly, accepting graffiti’s claim) is credible but could show a bit more on-page resistance at the peak. Overall she reads as a particular person, not a type.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motivation—to locate the unspoken library and secure access despite institutional resistance—is clear and consistently dramatized through her tracking, preparation, and willingness to violate protocol. The veiled-vision “Incident” gives her distinct interiority, though her emotional texture under peak pressure remains relatively composed and could use more contradictory impulses on the page. The Librarian functions effectively as a foil, applying gentle institutional pressure rather than real threat. The final choice to commit her life to this silence feels earned but lightly costed, more conceptual than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Iris’s interiority is specific and textured—her promise to herself, temptation by imperial favor, and empathy with objects and plants all cohere into a clear, conflicted value system. Her final choice to propagate the design rather than simply refuse the Empire grows naturally from those earlier traits and carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses (security vs integrity; preservation vs possession) operate simultaneously rather than in neat stages. Kemble is sketched efficiently as a status-pressure figure whose dialogue meaningfully sharpens her conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s vocation and motivation are vivid and specific—beautician and mortician in one, devoted to “capture one last spark before oblivion.” Her interiority is grounded in concrete perceptions (calluses, bent spine, static) rather than abstract labels. However, she faces little internal contradiction or ambivalence; she is almost entirely composed and competent. The lack of visible inner conflict or cost at peak moments keeps characterization short of fully great.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s characterization is rich and coherent: a long-practicing caretaker whose forgiveness is genuine yet still tested when the drunk driver appears. Her internal conflict—having forgiven yet not feeling “easy comfort”—is credible and plays out through concrete choices (guiding him to the Pool, revealing the hairpin, urging “Choose wisdom”). Emotions are mostly embodied via tactile anchors (the hairpin, the grotto), not just labels. The final stance—contentment as presence with pain—feels earned from her history rather than a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara and Keegan both feel specific and psychologically coherent, with clear motives (hired conscience vs. desperate researcher) and an earned if compact shift in Keegan from denial to vulnerable acceptance. The status dynamic—his initial professional warmth versus her blunt role—works well, and her refusal to be “cheerleader” is a clean, character-revealing micro-choice. The main weakness is that Mara sometimes functions as a slightly too-polished thematic mouthpiece, with less visible internal contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maia’s motivation (escaping her family’s scandal and the desire to disappear) is clear and credibly reconfigured by the end, and Keiran’s backward aging adds poignant pressure to his role as teacher. Interiority is solid but somewhat generalized; a bit more concrete, character-specific embodiment of Maia’s shame and resistance would deepen her. The shift from wanting invisibility to understanding the presence/absence paradox feels earned by the scene’s progression. The relationship dynamic—patient, withholding mentor and seeking but guarded student—is clear and functions well as the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The harmonic stone skimmer is distinct, with clear traits—reverent, patient, defined by stillness—and her choice to help the trapped pulse feels grounded in those qualities. The hunter’s consciousness is sketched economically but vividly through the birds’ pattern, giving just enough sense of who he was. Emotional life is more conceptual than embodied; we rarely feel her stakes in a bodily or contradictory way. The final “change” (her adding one more voice to the canyon) is credible but carries limited visible cost for her.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Teryn’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in specific values: a stubborn devotion to slow, beautiful, “inefficient” magic that puts her at odds with the Academy. Her choices—salvaging the folly keystone, climbing instead of teleporting, restoring the spire—flow directly from that worldview. The interiority is concrete rather than generic, though genuine internal contradiction (doubt vs faith in her method) is only lightly touched. The final reconfiguration of her self-concept (“exactly the mage she’d always been”) feels earned by the prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s motivation—recovering his mother’s journals and, through them, the color of sound—is clear and consistent, and his occupational cover story nicely reveals a cautious, obsessive temperament. Interiority is specific (the partial synesthesia, the pull of the key tag) and embodies grief without lapsing into therapy-speak. The main limitation is that his internal conflict (between rational salvage and quasi-mystical longing, between skepticism and belief) is more implied than dramatized in on-page decisions; once he decides to dive, his path is unusually smooth. The ending’s shift from solving to witnessing is credible and earned, but the emotional cost of that acceptance could be made more legible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s blend of “quietly enthusiastic” and steep doubt is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (which coins, which frequency, staying on the deck rather than fleeing) reveal a clear hierarchy of values. However, the internal conflict never quite sharpens into a truly pressured decision with visible cost; her realization of purpose feels more like a gentle confirmation than a hard-won shift. Emotions are largely summarized rather than deeply embodied, keeping us a bit outside her skin. The earned-stasis ending (choosing to proceed without certainty) works but could land harder if a more concrete alternative path were on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s grief, numb professional competence, and tentative re-engagement with her role are rendered with specific, embodied images (the blade, the hollow chest, the nameless souls). Her motivation to name fears grows organically from her daughter’s bravery and the reaper’s job. Internal contradiction—her compulsion to keep working while feeling emptied out—is present but could be sharpened with one or two more in-scene frictions. The final stance shift (“The work of reaping could begin again, but differently now”) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation (to restore the river/cosmic balance despite being “lukewarm”) is clear and consistent, and her mixture of insecurity and stubborn faith feels particular rather than generic. The brittle–earnest tension is named (“Her devotion to this theory was brittle…Yet she persisted”) and carried forward, though it’s more told than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual (“cosmic balance,” “cascade of absence”) over visceral sensation, which keeps her at a slight remove. Still, her final stance—staying to tend the rhythm—reads as an earned endurance with visible cost in vigilance and self-effacement.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivations (professional duty vs. ancestral memory) are clear and specific, and her choice to defy orders grows credibly from those traits. Her interiority is rendered with concrete ties to family history rather than abstractions. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized on the page, with little moment-to-moment vacillation or real doubt at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s internal split between empirical rigor and suppressed sentimentality is clear and specific, with concrete details like sketches, pressed flowers, and the mother’s locket grounding it. Her motivation—to complete a life’s work while distrusting intuition—is consistent and drives her actions. The decisive act of speaking memorized words “requiring…belief” pays off that contradiction credibly. The only limitation is that the emotional cost of this shift (what she truly gives up in self-conception) remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motivations and inner conflict (truth vs. trust vs. escape) are clear and consistent, and her final choice to stay, teach, and share the burden is well-earned. The parachute habit and tactile engagement with the arbor give her some embodied specificity. Emotional texture leans a bit on generalized formulations (“watcher’s burden,” “crushing responsibility”) rather than fully idiosyncratic perception. Still, we see contradictory impulses (urge to flee vs. refusal) operating simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kenji’s numbness, desire to feel, and ambivalence about his clone are clear and consistent, and Yoon’s tough, incisive guidance functions as a strong relational crucible. His final decision in court is credibly motivated by the dojo scene and his re-framing of the clone as “complement,” with visible emotional cost. There’s some diagnostic phrasing (“ego death,” “built new walls”) and lightly summarized emotion that slightly flattens texture in peak beats, but not enough to undercut the arc. The clone is thinly sketched, but the story wisely keeps focus on Kenji’s interior shift.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miranda’s professional drive and quasi-mystical receptivity to “signs” are clear and consistent, and her practical choices (planting the seed, reframing the business around it) align with that psychology. However, her interior conflict is underdeveloped: we’re told of corporate pressure, but we never feel a serious tug-of-war between selling out and staying independent. The decision at the end reads more like a foregone conclusion than a costly stance. A little more embodied doubt or fear would deepen her beyond an archetypal devoted creator.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: he’s driven by grief and a quasi-mystical faith in sound, and “mournfully eager” nicely encapsulates his contradiction. His internal life is embodied through his ritualistic handling of tools and the tunnel rather than abstract labels. The family upstairs are lightly sketched but their reactions feel psychologically credible and not generic. The internal conflict is more implied than directly tested—he never seriously doubts or risks doing harm—which keeps this just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian’s interiority is rich and particular, with the feral/human, librarian/animal contradiction informing every perception and the final shift to standing and reading feeling earned. Motivation evolves convincingly from disorientation to a chosen stance of “making friends with uncertainty.” The dimensional homesickness and loss of name deepen her, though a single sharper moment of on-page resistance before acceptance might further heighten the cost of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is rich and specific: we feel the accumulation of 17 years of “ash, mercury, and disappointment” and the tension between her calcified resignation and persistent, almost irrational persistence. Her motivation—to complete the Great Work and escape a safe but deadening destiny—is clear and drives every choice. The internal reversal (“Her failures hadn't been failures at all”) is well earned by the prior failures described, though embodied emotion under peak stress could be slightly more textured. The cost of her final stance (abandoning the Royal Metallurgist role, betraying her master’s doctrine) is conceptually clear but could be felt more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular—she stays in the ruined city, pursues the “shard of hush,” and consciously abandons conventional methods, all of which track cleanly to her actions. Interiority is concrete and tied to her work, and details like her tactile engagement with the fragment give her specificity. However, internal contradiction and real emotional risk are muted; she never pays much visible price for her shift in method or for her isolation. The closing realization feels earned but relatively low-cost, closer to serene confirmation than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motivation—to bring his forty-seven passengers back and “close” the loop—is clear, consistent, and tied to specific habits (ticket-checking, memorizing stories), and his stubborn optimism feels character-particular. However, his interior conflict is muted; we’re told he is “resiliently positive despite three years of failure,” but we rarely see doubt, anger, or fraying resolve in scene to complicate that trait. Secondary characters (especially Reeves) are evocative but lightly sketched and don’t meaningfully pressure his choices. The final endurance/renewal beat is earned but could cut deeper if his internal costs and contradictions were more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motive—reaching her brother by understanding “the texture of connection”—is clear, particular, and drives every choice, and her professional identity as a “fever dream architect” feels lived-in. The grief/schizophrenia backstory meaningfully colors her present actions without overwhelming the scene. However, her emotional experience in the climax is more conceptual than embodied, with relatively little on-page contradiction or struggle as reality bends. The brother-construct is intentionally thin, but that also means the relationship under pressure never quite combusts into a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Yael’s motivation and professional identity are sharply defined, and her choice to seek surface assignment coheres with the “balancedly curious” trait. Interiority is specific to her vocation—she thinks in terms of anchors, charts, and horizons—which keeps her from feeling generic. However, most of her conflict is already decided off-page, so we see articulation more than struggle, and her emotions stay largely conceptual rather than bodily embodied. Reeves functions more as a sounding board than as active pressure on her, so the relational crucible is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s core drives—curiosity and the urge to protect “vulnerable voices”—are clear and consistently enacted, and her job-specific interiority feels particular rather than generic. However, we rarely see genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure; she moves smoothly from curiosity to action without a felt moral or personal cost. Secondary figures (the boy, Elena, the authorities) are entirely off-page, so relationships do not become crucibles in scene. The final “incidental heroism” beat lands, but with limited sense of what it deeply changes in Mara beyond a quiet satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s core contradiction—claustrophobia versus compulsion to enter the facility—is clear, consistent, and drives her presence in the story. Her motivation tied to her erased sister is strong and particular, and her interiority is filtered through concrete perception (compass needles, dripping water). The main limitation is that her internal conflict under peak pressure (when water seeps in) is reported more than dramatized as a live, moment-by-moment struggle. The closing choice to keep returning reads as endurance/renunciation with cost, but that cost could be felt more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and grounded—the heart-counting, the shard, and the ink ritual all reveal a coherent, particular psyche under pressure. His core motive (to “defragment” after the death error) cleanly explains his choices, and the final renunciation of counting is earned. Internal contradiction (fear vs. reverence toward his heartbeat and death) is present but could be dramatized more sharply in moment-to-moment impulses. Overall, he reads as an individual rather than a type, with credible emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maerith’s motivation—to preserve Keshrin by any means available—is vivid, consistent, and threaded through object, environment, and method. Her grief and obsession feel grounded in specific losses (brother, daughter, forty-three years of isolation) rather than generic melancholy. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper on-page contradiction (e.g., her love for her daughter’s comfort in the common tongue versus her resentment), so her inner life remains more focused than conflicted. The final acceptance of not living to see her work decoded reads as credible endurance rather than a new, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s skepticism vs. craving for connection (especially with her dead mother) is sharply etched and culminates in a credible, costly choice to protect the secret and seek change herself. Her small micro-choices—pocketing the arrowhead, answering the phone, then taking the antenna—track a clear internal arc. Magda functions effectively as a pressure-bearing foil with her “frostbitten hope,” though their dynamic could bear one more moment of direct friction. Emotional embodiment is strong, if occasionally summarized rather than deeply dwelt in.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motive—to reawaken beauty in a mechanized world—is clear and consistently enacted through her choices to approach danger and keep playing. However, she reads as almost entirely unconflicted and emblematic, with little internal contradiction or felt risk; we do not see her doubt or fear when the statues advance. Her emotional life is more thematic than personal, which flattens potential complexity. The change at the end (discovering her “purpose”) feels more declared than psychologically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael is well-drawn through occupation, worldview, and micro-choices (pausing for drones, his care around law and families), and Mira’s brief appearance carries layered motive and risk. His “respectfully rebellious” stance is dramatized rather than labeled, but his internal conflict under pressure is relatively mild—he’s uneasy about the storm but never truly tested. Emotional embodiment is good yet somewhat restrained, with limited contradictory impulses. The ending crystallizes his role more than it forces a costly personal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The carpenter’s motivations and worldview—restoring carousels, treating silence as fertile space—are clear and specific, and they consistently inform her choices. Her occupational competence and ritualistic respect for the work (“quiet ceremony”) are well-drawn. The key change—her move from seven years of silence to humming and then singing—lands emotionally but is under-pressured; there’s little sense of fear, resistance, or risk in breaking that silence. A touch more contradiction or visible cost in that moment would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Meridian’s interiority is specific and rooted in concrete history (the grandmother, the logbooks, the tactile obsession with books), and her motivations are clear and consistent across the piece. Her “sanely eccentric” traits are dramatized through behavior rather than labels, and the intellectual drive feels lived-in. The internal change—from believing geometry is a tool to realizing it is the place itself—is earned by the preceding work. What’s slightly missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visible cost to this realization beyond a gentle reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s grief and fixation on Iris are specific and convincingly motivated, and her ritualized dawn practice feels like exactly what this person would do. Interiority is concrete and sensory rather than abstract, especially around the palette and camera. Internal contradiction is mild—she’s mostly moving in one emotional direction—but the endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting Iris’s absence while continuing the ritual) is credible. The relationship with Iris is vivid despite Iris being off-page, though a slightly sharper moment of ambivalence or resentment could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation and inner conflict are sharply drawn: love for her daughter versus fear that pursuing beauty makes her selfish, and that contradiction drives every beat. Her realization during the disorienting sequence feels earned by what we’ve seen of her history and self-protective lies. The locksmith is thinner but still functions clearly as a pressure-bearing counterpart rather than a prop. The final stance—accepting that her fear harmed more than it protected—has a tangible emotional cost in regret and lost time.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s curiosity, fear, and long-term obsession are all legible and consistent, and her life trajectory (folklorist specializing in “hidden truths”) clearly grows from the lost memory. The recovered scene with the guardian retroactively motivates her avoidance and her decades-long research, giving the final choice to remember a solid emotional base. Internal conflict could be sharpened in the present-tense scene—her hesitation or fear on re-entering the greenhouse is mostly summarized rather than dramatized—so the choice feels slightly less pressured than it could. Still, the arc from terrified teenager to someone ready to bear the burden of knowledge is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Miren and Kael are sharply sketched with clear, specific motives—Miren’s disciplined, slightly prickly mentorship versus Kael’s desperate urgency. The “reversible exile” premise is convincingly rooted in their flaws (rushing vs. yielding, fighting vs. staying). Internal contradiction appears through behavior and dialogue rather than exposition, especially Miren’s snap/gentleness mix. The main limitation is that Kael’s inner life stays mostly implied; a touch more embodied interiority under pressure could deepen her change.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Esme’s vocation, temperament, and motive are clear and consistently dramatized through her observational habits and the patient, craft-like way she “weaves” essences. The gardener-specific interiority (“learning when to cut and when to let grow”) gives her a particular worldview rather than a generic mystical heroine. Internal conflict is very muted—the piece grants her near-total competence and calm, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or real doubt. The final recommitment to her work lands as an earned endurance, but it lacks a visible personal cost or unresolved tension that would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s characterization is specific, embodied, and internally conflicted: a broken restorer whose trembling hands and unfinished mask echo her moral ambiguity about “grounding” vs. freeing. Her motivation to help the dead is clear but complicated by the accumulating silence she carries, and that tension informs her choice to free the boy despite knowing it may not bring peace. The boy’s simple, age-appropriate voice (“Will it hurt?” / “I wasn’t alone when I drowned.”) adds emotional texture and stakes. The final endurance—she absorbs yet another heavy silence and keeps working—reads as earned stasis with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena is sharply etched—her methodological curiosity, attraction to absence, and ethical stance toward mystery all feel coherent and specific. Her motives (to serve the Trust but also protect the site’s intangible qualities) are clear and drive her choices. What’s missing for a higher score is a stronger sense of internal friction or visible cost; she moves from insight to insight with relatively little strain or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina’s motives and inner life are rich and consistent—her relationship to death, her inherited intellectual obsessions, and her need for the log all align and drive every choice. The generational triangulation (Marina–Eleanor–Marsh) is sharply sketched through objects and documents. The main limitation is that her contradictory impulses are mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in on-page struggle; she adapts smoothly. A slightly more embodied, moment-to-moment resistance at the climax could deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The balladeer’s motives and temperament are clear and particular—her marginalization, her relationship to sound and attention, and her receptivity to the ghost all feel grounded. However, she encounters little real resistance, and we don’t see much simultaneous contradiction (fear vs. awe, doubt vs. compulsion) under pressure. Her key choice—to collaborate and encode the ghost’s messages—feels fitting but carries minimal visible cost on the page. The emotional arc is satisfying but relatively uncomplicated for elite-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and grounded (the remembered cloud lesson, her reaction to the entries) and her final stance shift—holding “something more permanent than sorrow”—is motivated by what she reads. There’s a nice tension between her role as servant and the depth of the captain’s regard. However, we don’t see much contradictory impulse on the page during the ascent; she processes rather smoothly instead of struggling between conflicting needs. The relationship is powerful but one-sided in-scene, since Thessaly is only present via text.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s grief, scientific rigor, and fixation on Victor are particular and consistent, with concrete habits (returning to the gondola, touching the fingerprints) that reveal her. Her motivation—to prove the sky remembers—is clear and drives every observation. There’s a quiet but legible shift from private obsession to committed public stance (“Tomorrow she would present her findings…”). Internal contradiction (mourning vs. method) is present but could be pushed further under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s interiority is specific and grounded in the concrete fact of her prosopagnosia and her painstaking measuring habits, which nicely echo the monk’s obsession. Her motivation—to keep attempting recognition in spite of her perceptual limits—feels coherent and earned. The closing intention to paint the custodian from memory is a credible extension of her established pattern rather than a sudden revelation. What’s missing, slightly, is a sharper sense of internal contradiction under immediate pressure (e.g., any temptation to refuse the guild’s burden or walk away before engaging).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is clearly and efficiently characterized—young, rigorously curious, caught between communal life and solitary thought—with motives that align cleanly to her actions. Her puzzle-solving under pressure feels authentic to her role as apprentice-cartographer. However, internal conflict is minimal: she never seriously wavers between safety and experimentation, so we don't feel a meaningful cost or contradiction at the choice point. Captain Halbrook functions more as a foil/support than a pressure source, which keeps relationship dynamics relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Celeste’s motivation is clear and specific—moving from being a “tool” to understanding what she truly mends—and her final reorientation into a clockmaker is coherent with that setup. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene; we’re told she feels hollow but rarely see contradictory impulses tested under pressure. The realization in the mirror hall comes quickly and with little resistance, so the cost of her shift reads gentle rather than hard-won. Still, her craft-specific worldview and reverence for the gears give her an individual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirela’s motivations are clear and consistent—protecting the orchards and the communal ethic—and Kess’s pivot from hoarding to sharing is credibly rooted in grief and fear. The ghost’s agency in shifting tactics from fading messages to burning ones shows adaptive, goal-driven behavior. However, interior contradiction is sketched rather than deeply inhabited; we’re told Kess’s fear, but we don’t spend much time in her body or mind under pressure. Relationships function symbolically (ghost ↔ community) more than as a fully dramatized crucible between individuated people.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is sharply etched—transmuting her failed doomsday work into one last act of care—and her choices (keeping the puppet, climbing the stairs, planting the lullaby, choosing to merge) all align. Interiority is specific and embodied (“cradled against her chest like a damaged heart,” “voice cracking with bruised awe”) rather than generic. The internal conflict—accepting the end while still insisting on leaving a trace of tenderness—is present but could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine doubt or temptation to cling to survival. The final inward adjustment of the clock feels earned and carries a clear personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motives and reluctance are clear and specific, and her sense of obligation to strangers reads as psychologically credible. The scene gives her several micro-choices under pressure (whether to engage with the hikers, how much to reveal, how precisely to guide them) that align with her values. The internal turn from resentment to acceptance at the end is earned but a bit swift, with limited on-page struggle between the urge to escape and the pull of duty. Secondary characters are thin but serviceable as pressure rather than people, which is appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and convincing, with her chemist’s mindset shaping how she processes grief and the environment. Her motivation—atonement mixed with intellectual blockage—is clear and consistent, and the choice to return to the lab feels earned by what we’ve seen. The relationship with Daniel is vivid despite his absence, and the guilt over their final disagreement adds credible ambivalence. The main limitation is that her emotional shift from blocked grief to clarity happens smoothly, with little residue of contradiction in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, worldview, and motives are sharply etched—“clean slate vendor” with a belief that erasure requires prior understanding is distinctive and consistent. Her actions (uncorking moonlight, carving coordinates) all align with that ethos. What’s missing at a top-tier level is live internal contradiction or visible emotional cost; she never really wavers under pressure. The piece ends with a conceptual shift more than a personal one, so her arc feels intellectually rich but emotionally contained.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motive (to process and “sandpaper” stored remorse) is clear and consistently enacted, and her professional frame as a chef gives her interiority a specific, idiosyncratic lens. The curse/gift of touch-based memory tasting is well integrated but the “emotions flowed both ways” risk is under-exploited; she never feels truly endangered by that aspect. Her sturdiness is asserted and lightly dramatized (“even if her heart felt brittle”), yet we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond fatigue vs duty. The closing endurance/renunciation (she leaves carrying only her own memories) feels earned but low-friction for a piece aiming at highest-tier literary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: she wants to transform an old logistics network into a conduit for human connection, and every choice on the page flows from that. Her “empathetically decisive” nature is shown in how she both sings and then pointedly calls on specific elevators, especially her firm but respectful address to Elevator Seven. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she feels both tenderness and steely resolve, yet we don’t see her truly torn in a way that risks her project. Refugee voices feel human but remain sketched rather than deeply individuated, appropriate to the scope but limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and particular—“helix-minded,” afraid and exhilarated, and altered by the synaptic protocol in a way that feels specific rather than generic. Her motivation to reclaim and redirect the Archive is clear, and her entanglement with others’ memories gives her a credible internal conflict. However, under pressure she faces little meaningful resistance; the final “choice” to repurpose the tech comes smoothly, with minimal on-page struggle or cost. More dramatized micro-choices under friction would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Celene’s core drive (to find “forgotten combinations” and save the archive) is clear and consistent, and her prism-minded perception reads specific rather than generic. However, she rarely experiences visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure; she remains serenely competent throughout. The planting choice at the end feels fully aligned with her stated motives but involves little apparent emotional cost or sacrifice. A bit more friction—fear, doubt, or a competing desire—would deepen characterization at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to resurrect music as vibration—is clear, specific, and enacted in concrete choices (salvaging telegraph parts, wiring the grove, playing until her fingers bleed). Her interiority is vivid and particular (“symphonically minded”), but we see little true internal contradiction or doubt under pressure; she’s almost serenely certain. The visible cost is mostly physical (bleeding fingers) rather than a deeper value conflict or relational strain. Strong, compelling, but short of the layered ambiguity that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Katrin’s motivation is clear and specific—an exiled aesthete seeking beauty in difficulty—and her chess-centered worldview shapes every choice. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“beauty over brutal efficiency,” “hopeful melancholy”), though moments of internal contradiction under real pressure are relatively mild. Her decisive act (using chess as a bridge) is well motivated by prior traits, but the emotional cost of exile and risk to the city stays somewhat abstract on the page. The change at the end—reframing her exile as necessary discovery—feels earned but not deeply contested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcella’s characterization is rich and specific—the purple-stained fingers, the pacifism expressed as refusal to “force open a lock,” and her vocation of cataloging silences all cohere into an idiosyncratic, convincing psyche. Her motivation to open the diary is clear and emotionally grounded, and the final shift in her understanding of Elena’s pacifism feels earned. Internal contradiction (her gentleness vs. the painful truths she risks uncovering) is present but could be sharpened further in on-page hesitation or self-deception under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirien’s ambition, sensitivity, and resolve are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in her choice to endure three days beside the bloom. The olfactory curse/gift tension and her coping behaviors (journaling, doodling, pot placement) give her a specific psychology. Internal change—from being ruled by her sensitivity to witnessing it—is credible if slightly neat. The main limitation is how cleanly articulated her realizations are, leaving little mess or ambiguity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation (family orchards’ decline, need for answers) is clear and consistently drives her actions, and her competence as a Turning pilot is well-grounded in concrete behavior. What’s missing at a top-tier level is layered internal conflict—she rarely wavers, doubts, or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure, so her psychology feels clean rather than complex. Her emotional reaction to hearing her grandmother and discovering the theft is present but somewhat compressed. The final resolve to go to the council is credible, but we don’t see much cost in terms of fear, anger, or potential backlash.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is specific—a structural-collapse investigator with a father-shaped ethos of “foresight”—and her competence is credible on the page. Her motivations (understand the collapse, honor her father’s lessons) are clear and shape her choices. However, internal contradiction and real emotional cost remain muted; she mostly processes and observes rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The closing “lesson” feels earned but relatively low-stakes for her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s vocation, sensory world, and long-term motive are clear and specific, and his synesthetic perception gives him a distinct interior lens. However, he faces little genuine inner conflict or competing impulse in the moment; once the ritual begins he never doubts, wavers, or pays a visible personal price beyond effort. His emotional life trends more devotional and serene than pressured, which softens the impact of his choice. The ending reads as fulfilled intention rather than a hard-won or costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s guilt, methodical investigation, and gradual acceptance read specific and earned, with concrete habits (mapping markers, testing echoes) revealing character. The realization that the failure “belonged to time itself” grows logically from on-page evidence, not hand-waving. Internal conflict between self-blame and curiosity is present but slightly smoothed—her transition from crushing guilt to functional acceptance could bear one more moment of friction. Still, her final choice to witness endings rather than fix them feels like a credible, costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The operator’s fear of being “an equation with missing operators” and his compensatory borrowing of personas create a rich, contradictory interior that feels specific and earned. His dynamic with Mira is an effective crucible: her accusation forces him briefly into his own voice and alters his next choice (setting type with his “own uncertain hands”). Motivation is clear and consistent—understand the mathematics of emotion before the stars vanish—and every key action aligns with it. The only small limiter is that his blind spots and flaws, while present, are explored more conceptually than through messier, embodied mistake-making.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kessa’s nervousness, sense of duty, and grief over Orin are clearly embodied and consistent, with concrete gestures like touching the pendant grounding her interiority. Her micro-choice to stop for the farmer and later to reframe her work after the herbalist encounter feels motivated and coherent. The internal contradiction—wanting to hurry and finish deliveries vs. honoring wonder—is present but could be pushed harder under real pressure. The final acceptance of her role is earned but a little tidy, with limited messiness or moral complication.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s grief, skepticism, and need to honor Castellan create a coherent, specific interiority, and her decision to test the frost method and accept its result feels motivated. However, her internal conflict is relatively smooth; we see little real resistance or contradictory impulse once the prism reacts, so the turn from “half-believing mystic” to accepting dangerous knowledge feels somewhat too untroubled. Embodied emotion is strong in details like gripping the steering wheel and seeing traces of that in the frost. The mentor relationship is vivid but entirely retrospective, limiting how much it can actively pressure her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The loom spinner’s grief, endurance, and final choice are clearly motivated and consistent, and her micro-choices (resuming the weave, removing the bead, pushing through bleeding fingers) track well to her goal. Her interiority is more archetypal than idiosyncratically human, but it fits the fable-like frame. The cost—her life-force—lands as an earned renunciation rather than a forced twist. Some emotional description leans on familiar phrasing (“stoically sparkling,” “unshed tears”) rather than fully particularized embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to revive the planet at the cost of his own memories—is coherent, specific, and tracked cleanly through his choices, especially the decision to keep striking as memories slip away. His meekness and craft competence are nicely juxtaposed, giving him texture beyond a generic martyr. The internal conflict between self-erasure and purpose is mostly implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous contradictory impulses, which slightly softens the peak moment. Still, the final Earned Stasis—contentment in confusion after the cost is paid—feels earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaia’s interiority is vivid and particular—her sensory-mapping cognition feels unique, and her mixture of longing, resentment, and awe around her mother is credible. Her final choice (“Teach me”) is well-motivated by the accumulated history of abandonment/protection and her professional identity. The mother is somewhat more a delivery mechanism for exposition than a fully pressured presence, but the relationship still functions as a crucible. The emotional contradiction—hurt versus understanding—could be dramatized a touch more in-scene rather than largely summarized in one paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera is specific, consistent, and motivated: the Silent Skipper whose attention expresses care, and whose decisive act—building the cairn and promising to return—feels earned by the history of letters and stones. Her emotional life is embodied in details like the ache in her chest and her rough, unused voice, though internal contradiction (fear vs duty, distance vs connection) stays more implied than dramatized in on-page back-and-forth. The ghosts function more as a conceptual presence than as individuated characters, which keeps relational pressure muted. Overall, the arc from silent observer to active guardian is convincing but could use one sharper moment of doubt or resistance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is vivid—a laughing, storm-loving keeper with an archivist’s streak—and her professional competence comes through clearly in the ritual. However, her interior conflict is thin: she notes the eeriness of her prophecies but never meaningfully struggles with it or makes a costly choice. Her motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated more than dramatized. The piece ends in emotional continuity rather than a felt shift or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dye master is specific, competent, and internally coherent, with her watchfulness and professional eye for light translating cleanly into her new role as listener. Her motivation—to understand what the donor heart has changed and what is being asked of her—emerges organically from both backstory and present pressure. The emotional turn from unease to acceptance is credible but relatively low-friction; we rarely see her genuinely resist or mishandle the “magnetism,” which keeps the arc from feeling fully tested. The proprietor is sketched effectively as a gentle pressure rather than a full counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s curiosity, competence, and quiet reverence are well established, and her decision to follow the pin and then reconstruct the sextant feels organically motivated. Interiority is grounded in her long familiarity with the labyrinth, with nice embodied touches like the split thumb. However, internal conflict is muted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or risk, so her shift at the end reads more as an illumination than a pressured choice. The endurance of her role with a new understanding is credible but could carry more visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to save the dying realm even at the cost of her own coherence—is clear, and the progression from scattered fragments to sacrificial dissolution is coherent and earned. However, her inner conflict is more implied than dramatized; we’re told she’s thinning and paying a price rather than feeling her wrestle with fear or hesitation on the page. The mythic distance keeps her from fully individuating as a person with idiosyncratic, contradictory impulses. The final renunciation reads thematically right but emotionally a bit pre-packaged rather than sharply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor’s characterization as a hyper-empathetic recluse is consistent and motivates all major choices, especially her initial withdrawal and later acceptance of the society. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal, with nice details like her watching others fold their lives into neat squares. However, her internal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly into an articulated insight, with limited on-page struggle at the moment of decision. Secondary characters (especially the librarian woman) are functional but thin, operating mostly as thematic mouthpieces.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply drawn through her pattern of noticing, her guilt, and her commitment to planting; her micro-choices (tasting the bread, deciding to keep planting) feel grounded in those traits. The old woman is more archetypal and largely a mouthpiece, but still clear and coherent. The internal conflict between complicity/guilt and a more sacred motivation is compact yet convincing for the length. The closing stance—continuing to plant with a sobered understanding that it won’t be “enough”—reads like an earned, costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Celeste’s motivations (preserve then transform the library’s essence) are clear and consistent with her role and temperament, and her micro-choices—measuring, reweaving, ultimately releasing the capsule—track well. Her interiority is textured but somewhat one-note in its serene acceptance; we get limited sense of contradictory impulses or active struggle as she chooses to die with the library. The final choice feels earned but emotionally under-contested, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Della’s motivation—identify the traitor and record the “sound of trust breaking”—is sharp, specific, and governs all her actions. The relationship with Kern carries real history and moral complexity, and his confession feels human rather than villainous. Her final act of mercy is well-earned by the revelation about his daughter, though her interior conflict could be embodied a bit more at the peak. Emotional texture leans slightly more conceptual than visceral in the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaia’s skepticism vs. involuntary luminosity gives her a clear, engaging contradiction, and her motivation (“I want to know the mechanism”) is consistent and particular. Her arc from rationalist distance to inviting the weather in feels earned by the sensory build-up (metallic tastes, ring behavior, observations of carriers). The final renunciation of the ring is a credible, concrete choice that marks change. A deeper sense of personal cost or risk beyond “embarrassment” and abstract belief-shift would push this closer to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s guilt, avoidance, and talent are sharply realized, and her final decision to climb back up feels well earned by the established history with her brother and years of self-sabotage. The mnemonic “curse” and charcoal on her fingers are concrete, character-specific. The docent risks drifting into a moral-delivery device, but her backstory about her daughter gives her enough human motive to avoid flatness. Internal conflict (self-punishment vs. honoring her brother) is present, though she capitulates a bit quickly once confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is vivid and particular—her leaf physiology, craft, and sensitivity to dishonesty all align with her choices, and Kade’s small arc from glib dismissal to vulnerable honesty is cleanly motivated. Her obsession with the fragment and map is credible, if somewhat straightforward; there’s limited on-page contradiction or messiness in her interior life. The physicalization of emotion via her leaves is excellent, but her fear vs. desire for connection could be dramatized in a more conflicted, pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation and worldview are clear and specific, and her actions (retrieving the iceberg, designing the kinetic sculpture) align with a coherent inner drive. However, she encounters almost no on-page resistance or dilemma, so we see little contradictory impulse or costed choice. The seasonal muteness is thematically apt but never pressures a scene choice. The ending reflects endurance more than a new stance, which keeps the arc relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Unit-47’s motivation (resolving its internal static and regaining a sense of purpose) is clear and consistently dramatized through concrete choices like starting the burn and compressing its consciousness. The “ache” and nostalgia for the child read specific rather than generic, anchored by the cardboard box and lullaby. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle—duty vs. self-preservation, function vs. longing—rather than sharply torn. The final endurance (“fragmented but functional”) feels earned by prior beats and the visible cost of destroying the roses and the box.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s characterization is specific, grounded in her vocation and history, and her choices (courtyard listening, approaching Iris, opening the mailbox) feel motivated and coherent. Iris is thinner but not generic; her collapse at the fountain and reaction to the letters are believable. Emotional states are mostly embodied and particular, though some lines drift toward therapy-speak summary (“grief needed witnesses, not solitude”). The internal conflict around grief and presence is present but could be sharpened into more contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivations are clear and particular—she wants freedom but chooses patient, covert resistance rather than open revolt, which feels grounded in her history with the Ministry. Her lyrical way of thinking (codes as music, algae as vocabulary) feels specific rather than generic “genius.” However, internal conflict is muted; we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure, only a steady confidence in her long game. The emotional cost of leaving the journals and the place that reshaped her could be shaded more viscerally to deepen the sense of change.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s grief-driven curiosity and quiet stubbornness are clear and specific, and her vocation as lantern lighter nicely shades how she approaches the strange phenomenon. Her motivation—to reclaim her grandmother’s lost memories—feels emotionally grounded and drives her choices. The shift from dock worker to clandestine curator of memories is credible, but internal contradiction (e.g., ethical qualms about handling others’ memories) is only lightly implied, not dramatized. A slightly stronger sense of cost or ambivalence at the end would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The summoner’s motivation is clear, rooted in family lore and long solitude, and her choices directly pursue that goal. Interiority is competent and occasionally vivid (“tranquil blaze of focus”), but her emotional life is too smooth; there’s little on-page conflict about erasing memories or the cost of her power. She never seriously doubts, falters, or reveals a flaw beyond fatigue, which flattens what could be a richer crucible. The final “smiled” feels slightly facile given the enormity of what she’s done.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s curiosity and professional identity as an architect generate clear motivation and a credible arc from skepticism to committed apprenticeship. Dr. Khoury is sharply sketched through habits, diction, and small physical details, with her longevity revealed in a way that feels consistent with previous “slips.” However, the narrator’s internal conflict at the rooftop confrontation is relatively muted—there’s little simultaneous push-pull between wanting the truth and fearing its implications. The final “Teach me everything” choice lands, but the emotional cost of stepping over that threshold could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation—saving her sister’s legacy and redeeming quarantine—is clear and consistent, and small gestures like pressing the shell to her chest ground her emotionally. However, internal contradiction (isolation vs connection, fear vs hope) is more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. Chen functions mainly as an appreciative interlocutor, offering little counter-pressure. The final commitment to use Anya as the first trial is thematically apt and earned but could carry more overt emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lien’s vocation, loyalty to her master, moral hesitation, and eventual acceptance are clearly dramatized and coherent, and her micro-choices with the thorn, ink, and brush under pressure feel specific to her. The internal conflict between treason and a “deeper truth” is present, though it’s articulated more in reflective summary than through sharply contrasted impulses in-scene. Her final certainty feels earned by prior beats and forecloses the path of refusal with a visible moral cost. The lack of any on-page interpersonal crucible keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s curiosity and gradual acceptance of her role are clear and consistent, and the moment her voice splits works as a meaningful internal turn. However, her interiority stays relatively generalized—there’s little sense of contradictory impulses, fear, or resistance that would complicate her transformation. Maren, the Veshar, and the “allies” remain mostly functional rather than felt presences. The final acceptance feels earned but emotionally under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya is sharply sketched: competent, obsessive about truth, and tender toward the dead, with embodied details like “diving-callused palms” grounding her. Her motivation to connect dreams to wrecks and honor the ghosts’ wishes is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is relatively muted—she doesn’t seem to struggle or pay much emotional price in the moment, which slightly flattens the arc. Still, her final promise to the captain feels earned by the careful interpretive work earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Chen’s characterization is vivid and particular—her fusion of manual craft and philosophy, her attentiveness to hidden labor, and her pedagogical criteria around the whisk all feel organically motivated. Emotional texture is mostly implicit rather than dramatized under pressure, but her choice to remain a humble net-mender instead of seeking glory gives her a credible, if quiet, renunciation. Internal contradiction (desiring recognition for others’ hidden effort while accepting her own obscurity) is present but subtle. The off-page student relationship is promising yet untested in-scene, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s core motivation (debunking comfortable lies) is clear and credibly stressed by the revelation that truth would harm survivors, and her final act of burning the documents reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost to her identity. Interiority is specific enough—her attention to details like the dust flow and the equations—though her emotional struggle is summarized more than embodied at the end. The internal contradiction between professional ethos and moral calculus is strong but could be given one or two sharper, in-the-moment beats of hesitation or rationalization. Vera functions effectively as a quiet moral counterpoint without needing a full arc.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s core motivation—using “ancient shadows” to shape a new dawn—is clear, consistent, and integrated with her behavior (choosing to broadcast without taking sides). Her interiority has some vivid, specific textures (ozone, burnt coffee, tasting copper) that ground her emotional state. However, her internal conflict between being used by factions and pursuing her own agenda is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in concrete, pressured choices. The final realization (“both the question and the answer”) lands a bit as a pre-packaged epiphany rather than something earned through a visibly escalating internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s characterization is vivid and specific—the vagrant poet, sound-jar collector, ex-watchmaker’s granddaughter—so her decision to become an intergenerational “translator” feels earned. Motivation is clear and consistent from first paragraph through the decision to take the composite to Mrs. Chen’s class. Internal conflict is relatively mild (more a clarification than a wrenching dilemma), which keeps this just shy of the very top tier. Still, we see concrete micro-choices (restoring the music box, combining jars, deciding to share) that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is sharply etched—a “logically emotional” engineer whose professional habits credibly shape her choices, and her history with singing rock grounds her solution. Her emotional life (wife, grief, reverence for materials) is vivid in few strokes, and Kael works well as a focused counter-impulse even if he’s more archetypal. The internal conflict between mercy via destruction and mercy via containment is present but resolved with relative ease; a bit more hesitation or cost on Maren’s side would deepen it. Still, her final choice feels earned by prior causality and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motives are clear, specific, and consistent, rooted in her mapping skill, her sister’s death, and her commitment to a “patient” revolution. The internal contradiction between fury and discipline is well articulated and dramatized through her tactical choices and the group’s restrained behavior. Emotional embodiment leans a bit abstract at times, but images like “water beneath ice” carry genuine felt texture. Secondary characters are mostly a chorus, but this suits the scope and doesn’t blunt Kael’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sara’s motives and contradictions (career vs integrity, fear vs persistence, personal vs ancestral pressure) are clear and embodied in her meticulous work and physical unease. Her choice to keep documenting in defiance of Chen reads earned and aligned with her profession and history. Some phrasing (“fortified vulnerability,” “empirical observation”) skews abstract/label-like rather than organically arising from her interiority, slightly flattening specificity. With Chen off-page, relational pressure is more told than dramatized, limiting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s guilt, procrastination, and attempt at moral repair are clear and consistent, and Mrs. Chen reads as a grounded, specific foil whose pragmatism pushes him toward action. His motivation (to finally deliver what Thomas entrusted him) is well seeded and credibly culminates in the decision to return Thursday. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in live dilemma—he feels bad and then resolves, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage. A slightly messier, more contradictory interior landscape under pressure would deepen him to top-tier literary caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Fennec’s curiosity, irreverent awe, and cartographer mindset are specific and consistent, and her vocation history (cart glider → cartographer of want) is neatly integrated with the premise. However, she experiences little genuine internal conflict or contradiction on the page; her stance is stable from start to finish. The “bell no one hears yet” goal is evocative but never forces a hard choice or renunciation. As a result, we get a rich sketch of character rather than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation, grief over her brother, and obsession with vanished data are clear and coherent, and her final decision to run the extraction grows logically from those traits. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped: the risk (“even if it cost her everything”) is asserted but not deeply felt or weighed against any counter-impulse on the page. We don’t see much embodied stress or degradation of thought under pressure; she remains coolly competent throughout. A bit more contradiction—fear vs. duty, personal vs. corporate loyalty—would elevate this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael is vividly characterized through her role, tools, and worldview, and her choice to intervene via the shard rather than authority feels coherent and motivated. The two clan leaders are sketched efficiently, with their key wounds and debts made legible through the mirrors. Internal contradiction in Kael is relatively muted—she functions more as a steady moral instrument than a conflicted person—which slightly flattens potential complexity under pressure. Still, her stance at the end (“We begin…”) reads earned by what she has perceived and chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s motives are clear and layered—the euthanasia tourism, the desire to “learn the sound of approaching endings,” and the later, quieter wish to linger in the liminal state all cohere. Her internal contradiction (scheduled death vs growing investment in life and work) is well dramatized through micro-choices, especially her non-cancellation of the appointment paired with the decision to stay through summer. Emotions are embodied via sensory attention and small gestures (handling the broken parasol, standing at the prow, listening through thin walls). The piece could edge higher with one moment of sharper on-page struggle or failure under pressure rather than largely graceful adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Both Marco and Elena feel particular and grounded in history, and Marco’s occupation-specific worldview (“destined mismatches,” grafting) personalizes his motives. Elena’s conflict between familial expectation (Dimitri) and buried desire (Marco) is clear, and her micro-choices with the letter fragment track credibly. However, the emotional path is relatively smooth—there’s little jaggedness or true ambivalence in her turn once the conversation begins. The “intersubjective understanding” line briefly drifts toward abstract label-speak rather than embodied motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motivation—preserving the echo—is clear and consistent, and her willingness to sacrifice part of her awareness tracks logically from her values. Her professional competence as a line walker is well-embodied in her relationship with the kinetic parapet. However, internal conflict is muted: she never seriously wavers, so the sacrifice lacks visceral ambivalence. The prophet functions as a useful witness but is more archetype than fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s vocation and demeanor are vivid and consistent, and her choices clearly shape the encounter, but she verges on saintly and frictionless, with little internal contradiction or cost. Thomas’s presence adds a welcome human texture—his badge, his hesitation at the lavender’s edge—but the relationship pressure is gentle rather than testing. Emotions are mostly embodied through concrete images (empty lunch boxes, indented chairs) rather than label-speak, which works well. The piece would reach a higher band if Mira’s calm carried more visible ambivalence or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s reticence paired with deep conviction is sharply drawn, and her mix of fear and childlike eagerness (“weathered innocence”) feels specific and earned. Her motivation—to prove language is still alive—is clear and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. Internal contradiction exists (terror of the Council vs. compulsion to speak), but it never quite sharpens into a painful on-page dilemma. The arc is more a crystallization of an already-made decision than a pressured change, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus and Sarah are both sharply etched, with clear, specific motives rooted in loss and time, and Marcus’s precognitive forgetfulness creates a genuine internal contradiction between longing to preserve and the inevitability of losing. The relationship dynamic—Sarah remembering for him, him relying on a future self’s tactics—plays as a subtle but real crucible rather than a convenience. The final refusal to “capture” the sound is entirely motivated by his earlier metaphors and dread of killing what he loves. Emotional embodiment leans a bit abstract at times (“tidal longing,” “slow surrender”) rather than always grounded in bodily feeling, which slightly blunts peak immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is richly realized through her craft-based perception and refusal to treat the clock as merely “broken,” and her micro-choices in restructuring the mechanism feel grounded in long competence. Her motivation—repair plus understanding—is clear and consistent. However, her internal conflict around whether to serve the observatory’s demand or honor what the clock “wants” is more implied than dramatized, so the emotional cost of her final stance remains somewhat muted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Richard’s motivation and regret are clear and specific, and his relationship with Linda has enough textured history to feel real despite the brevity. Maya, however, edges toward the flawless-angel archetype; “decisively kind” is an excellent phrase but we rarely see her under genuine inner strain or contradiction. Linda’s emotional turn (agreeing to come, then reconciling) reads plausible but compressed and mostly external. The final change—Richard achieving a “flawless goodbye”—is emotionally earned, though it resolves with minimal visible ambivalence or mess.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s scholarly precision, obsession with shadows, and dawning horror are clearly motivated and internally consistent, and her contradiction (careful analyst vs terrified “shadow-being”) is explicitly dramatized. Her micro-choices—deciphering the key, deciding to open the chamber, sitting to work through runes before noon—track well with that characterization. The emotional register tilts more toward articulated realization than embodied panic, so her terror feels slightly underpatterned in the body. Still, for this length, the interior conflict is rich and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren is sharply realized as a competent, aging skeptic whose worldview cracks and then reorients in a way that feels consistent with her history (“a forgiving skeptic who believed in what her hands could prove”). Thomas is vivid but slightly more function-as-mythic-expositor than fully conflicted child, and his fear or ambivalence about leaving is underplayed until the late “Can I go home?” line. The central change—Maren moving from empirical certainty to embracing and acting within magic—is well earned by her actions in the garden. Emotional embodiment is good, though her internal conflict during the ritual itself could use one more knot of doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s grief, history with fire, and quiet, service-oriented motivation are clear and consistent, and her ritualized craft nicely externalizes her inner life. Her micro-choices (which piece to polish, when it’s “ready,” where to place it) reveal values without overexplaining. However, internal contradiction is muted: she feels more resolved than actively torn, so we don’t see strong simultaneous opposing impulses on the page. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but emotionally low-voltage for a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is clear, specific, and textured: her history with surveillance, her choice to cultivate this garden, and the amber pendant all align with her watchful, wounded-but-active nature. The executive is sketched with efficient, credible guilt and disorientation. Mira’s former hatred and its transformation are mostly told rather than dramatized on the page, so the arc we witness is more maintenance than change. Emotional contradiction exists but could be heightened in-scene (e.g., more visible flashes of anger or recoil) to push into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The novelist’s grief, blocked creativity, and conflicted desire (finish the book vs. avoid finality about her daughter) are specific and convincing. Her motivation to come to this dangerous, liminal place and watch the rivers is well-grounded, and the swimmer conversation naturally exposes her inner stakes. The final shift—from needing reunion to accepting recognition through fragments—feels earned by what precedes it. The swimmer is sketched efficiently but still reads as a real person whose brief presence exerts genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maera’s motivation—to restore a broken bond between people and land—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her history of tinkering and “golden stories.” Interiority is present and character-specific, especially in how she assembles songs from communal fragments. However, she faces little real internal contradiction or moral friction; she is largely pure intention plus effort. The change at the end (from disconnection to partial restoration) is more about the world than about a visible shift or cost in her.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist’s motivation—grief for her daughter and the need to locate where that heartbeat has gone—is clear and consistently drives every choice. Interiority is vivid but skewed more toward ritual focus than truly conflicted emotional texture; we see her patience and devotion more than contradictory impulses. Her final decision to burn the map and rely on memory does carry a credible cost and endurance. Still, she reads as slightly too purely purposeful, with few on-page blind spots or irrationalities under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The locksmith’s curiosity and observational style are specific and consistent, and her final choice to reseal the cavern aligns with the traits established from the outset. Her motivation is clear and idiosyncratic (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”), and her micro-choices—studying, rebuilding, then withholding—track cleanly. What’s missing at this tier is a stronger sense of internal contradiction or emotional risk under pressure; she rarely doubts or struggles. The arc reads more as steady unfolding of competence than a crucible that exposes fissures.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The weaver’s vocation, endurance, and late realization are specific and coherent, and her motivation to witness and measure others’ burdens feels organically tied to the world. However, on-page contradictory impulses (resentment vs devotion, despair vs awe) are only lightly sketched; she largely moves in one contemplative register. The “boundary-lessly trapped” notion is strong but could bite harder in a concrete moment of near-refusal or rebellion. The final choice to rest yet continue is credible and thematically earned, though its emotional cost remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and textured—her “hauntingly practical” grief, the way she translates memories into gestures carved in wood, all feel deeply individuated. Motivation is clear and consistent: she carves to hold Viktor’s presence in a form congruent with her understanding of impermanence. What keeps this slightly below top-tier is the relative absence of in-the-moment contradictory impulses; she moves through the scene with calm, resolved purpose more than live inner conflict. Still, the closing acceptance (“someone who could hold loss without being crushed by it”) is credibly earned by everything preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kera’s interiority is specific, textured, and plausibly conflicted—especially her oscillation between scavenger pragmatism and eroded grand ambition. Motivation is clear (avoidance of her own story versus the pull to re-engage it), and the final choice to “start again” with smaller gardens feels earned by prior hesitation. The relationship with the ghost-self works as a tight crucible for self-judgment and self-forgiveness. A slight softness is that her new resolve comes somewhat smoothly once the wheel appears, with limited on-page resistance at the actual turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivations are clear, grounded in her engineering background and curiosity, and her actions consistently emerge from that drive. Her “functionally creative” mindset is shown in how she reads water stains and ducts as systems, not just in the label. However, there’s limited on-page contradiction or real internal struggle; she rarely doubts, fails, or pays an explicit emotional price. The endurance/change at the end is credible but relatively low-friction, keeping this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motives and history are clear, and her introversion, precision, and shame around music all cohere into the choice to play again here and now. Her emotional state is embodied through small actions (how she handles the violin, how she moves through the space) rather than pure labels. The final renunciation—accepting she will not be a virtuoso yet reclaiming the violin—feels earned and forecloses a path with a believable cost. The one limitation is that her inner conflict remains relatively smooth; there’s little on-page pushback once she decides to play, so contradiction under peak pressure is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and consistent: a professional legend-chaser whose disillusion drives him to dig deeper rather than retreat. His shift from chasing myth to salvaging truth feels earned, grounded in his history and the cost of twelve misdirected years. Internal contradiction is present—fascination with legends vs. dawning contempt for their use—but mostly explored conceptually rather than through on-page, pressured choices. The emotional register is more intellectual than bodily, but still convincing for this reflective, cerebral protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is sharply drawn—her vocation, patience, and tenderness toward seeds and Henrik’s widow feel specific and embodied (“Each rope was a manuscript. Each knot, a word.”). Her motivation to preserve heritage seeds and techniques is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (staying in the cold to decode, deciding to test chamomile first) align with that. What’s missing, at this tier, is real internal contradiction or conflicted impulse under pressure; she never seriously wavers, doubts, or wants something that cuts against her preservation ethic. The final stance is credible but largely an extension of who she already is, rather than a choice that costs her something newly visible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina and Thomas both feel specific and textured, with credible histories (ships, palace carpets) that show in how they perceive the present scene. Thomas’s resignation (“I was a weaver. Now I am not.”) and his shift to seeing the thread as a compass are well motivated by Marina’s intervention. Marina’s interior stakes—why she stays, what this work costs her—are hinted more than dramatized, which keeps this just shy of fully profound. The relationship dynamic is finely drawn but could use one sharper moment of genuine resistance or friction from Thomas.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prince’s longing for lost beauty, his trade of the ceremonial sword, and his obsessive, self-taught experimentation create a coherent, specific psyche under pressure. His awareness that the creature will be “something flawed” but his insistence on proceeding anyway gives him a credible internal contradiction. Emotional embodiment is strong (trembling fingers, weeping over crystallized cells), though his fear of his father and of possible failure could be dramatized more. The father–son dynamic is potent in the final scene but only lightly developed beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s characterization is rich and specific—firefighter, arsonist’s daughter, coin ritual, lagoon therapy—and her motivation to repurpose her father’s legacy is clear and consistent. Marcus, though secondary, is given enough history and vulnerability for his small arc (to that first real smile) to feel earned. The main weakness is that Maya’s inner life trends toward saintly and declarative; we’re told about her burden more than we see genuine contradiction or flare of anger or doubt in scene. Her final certainty about redemption feels plausible but a bit tidy given the depth of trauma implied.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and particular—“luminous skeptic” with “realistic imagination” reads as a specific psyche, not a type, and her skepticism inflects the miracle-work nicely. Her motivation to follow the shards and solve the city’s forgetting is clear and consistent, and her final acceptance of fading radiance is earned. Internal contradiction (skeptic yet chosen vessel) is present but under-dramatized in-scene; we’re mostly told she’s skeptical rather than watching it complicate choices. The emotional cost of losing her glow is graceful but a bit under-felt on the body level.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Keeper’s motivation and inner contradiction (duty-bound hope vs data-backed futility) are clear and character-specific, especially in “that peculiar grief their kind called ‘hope.’” However, most of this remains at a conceptual register; we don’t see many embodied, pressured micro-choices beyond proceeding with a familiar ritual. The emotional state is convincing but somewhat static, with endurance rather than change carrying the arc. The earned-stasis closure is credible, but a sharper on-page moment of tempted deviation would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is specific, competent, and motivated, with a clear professional identity and desire to deepen her understanding of grief, and Thomas functions well as a calm, directive counterpoint. Her shift from isolating individual losses to perceiving a network of grief is well motivated by the lessons and the ribbon. However, her inner conflict is relatively smooth—there’s little resistance, self-deception, or messy contradiction during the transformation—which keeps the arc from feeling fully lived-in. The emotional cost of realizing thirty years of work was too narrow is more implied than intensely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s vocation, precision, and inherited burden are clear and particular, and her actions all align with that quiet, devout sense of duty. Her motivation to perform the ritual and then burn the handle is well grounded in the father’s legacy and the town’s grief. What’s missing for a higher score is on-page contradiction or live inner struggle—she enacts a settled role more than she wrestles with it. The endurance feels earned but largely untested in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is clearly sketched—a blithe, meticulous caretaker whose curiosity and reverence for memory drive every action—and Castellan gains surprising dimensionality through the letters and his loom/tapestry obsession. Motivation is clean and consistent, and Mira’s final decision to plant the Helena rose feels earned. What’s missing at a top tier is deep, scene-level internal contradiction; Mira rarely wavers or reveals conflicting impulses under pressure. The emotional palette is rich but stable rather than dynamically conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    Maren’s role, competence, and values are clear and specific, and her vocation (“ignorance cartographer”) nicely inflects how she approaches the task. However, she faces almost no on-page resistance—internal or external—so we don’t see contradictory impulses or genuine strain under pressure. Her emotional life remains relatively cool and summarized (the work is “with reverent care,” but we don’t feel fear, doubt, or ego at stake). The final stance—having “done what few could”—lands as serene competence rather than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s motivation—to smuggle stories back into the world and even into dust—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her micro-choices (listening illegally, encoding scores, accepting risk). Interiority is vivid and particular rather than generic, and her professional competence as a copyist feels lived-in. What’s missing, at this tier, is a sharper internal contradiction or a moment where fear, doubt, or competing desires visibly pull against her work in-scene. The ending reads as earned stasis rather than change, convincing but emotionally steady rather than pressurized into a new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interior conflict—torn between Cassius’s creed of vanishing and her own compulsion to preserve—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through her omissions and secret archive. Cassius registers as a vivid presence despite limited page-time, with his slowing breath and requests for truth pressing on her choices. The link between her past mistake with the wife’s ashes and her current deceit is strong and motivates her final plan. Slightly more embodied emotional texture (beyond conceptual anguish) would push this toward the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcellus’s motivation—to preserve epistemic rigor against an official mystic narrative—is clear, consistent, and drives all his choices. His “abrasive calm” and rational rebellion feel particular and embodied in his methods rather than label-only. The main limitation is that internal conflict is relatively muted; he feels weighed but not truly torn, so the emotional cost of his stance is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, history of “unlearning hatred,” and practiced patience give her a clear, credible motivation, and the “expectant resignation” lifting at the end registers as a modest but earned shift. However, her interior conflict stays relatively abstract; we’re told her stance more than we feel her in moments of genuine doubt or frustration. The students function mostly as types (refugee, farmer’s son, newcomers) rather than individuated pressures on her. The result is strong, coherent characterization but short of the psychological grain and contradiction expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and specific—quietly defying the Council by regrowing forbidden knowledge—and her chef/memory-tasting lens gives her a distinct interiority. Her actions (planting, pruning, choosing which memories to nurture) all align with that motive. However, she experiences little visible internal contradiction or fear; the choice reads as firmly decided rather than contested under pressure. The ending shows endurance rather than a deeply tested change, which slightly limits the character arc’s complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is sharply sketched—her enforced honesty, solitary post, and habit of finding beauty in monotony all feel particular and consistent. Her compulsion to tell the truth is dramatized in small ways (answering the beekeeper, admitting she doesn’t understand) and colors the climax when she “spilled out” everything to the engineer. However, her internal conflict around this condition and her choice to intervene never feels truly costly or fraught; she moves fairly smoothly from passive observer to bearer of insight. The engineer is more functional than dimensional, offering little character pressure beyond receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s sensibility is specific and convincing—she’s the kind of person who notices “creeping normality,” and that curiosity motivates her entry and interpretation of the house. Her backstory with her grandmother’s perfume shop grounds her recognition of the orris root and feels organically tied to her skills. However, internal conflict and cost are light: her shift is more graceful realization than hard-won, contradictory struggle. The final decision to help the house remember is earned but emotionally low-risk, which keeps the characterization shy of top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Both Marina and the woman have clear, coherent motives—guardianship vs. inherited certainty—and those motives drive the scene. The woman's anguish at having her family myth complicated by moral ambiguity feels earned, not declared. Internal conflict (truth vs. comfort, martyrs vs. murderers) is well dramatized in her reactions and questions. The one weakness is that her final acceptance (“I’ll tell them the truth…”) comes a touch quickly, with little visible hesitation at the brink.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s characterization is rich and specific: a mathematician whose obsession, regret, and stubborn optimism all clearly drive her behavior. Her motivation to understand the staircase as compensation for the missed Institute position feels lived-in and consistent. The moment she realizes she *is* the perpetual motion and still chooses to keep climbing reads as an earned endurance with visible cost. Slightly more embodied, less cerebral emotional texture under peak stress could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistently tied to concrete choices: the six-month portrait project, her nocturnal working, her fixation on the brush as proof that she’s remembered. Motivation (to preserve fleeting kindness as she once preserved alphabets) is clear and embodied in her actions. The small but real turn—from compulsive wakefulness to an earned willingness to sleep and then seek the anonymous giver—reads as a credible, paid-for shift. Internal contradiction (exhaustion vs. methodical hope) could be dramatized under more acute on-page pressure, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Celeste’s characterization is rich and specific—her museum training, inherited rituals, and “rosewater dread” give her a distinct interior life, and her invitation to the violinist feels like a motivated micro-choice under emotional pressure. The newcomers are sketched efficiently but with enough specificity (the violinist’s hands, the weeping) to matter. Internal contradiction—practiced warmth over dread—is present but could be sharpened further under real strain. The final sense of lightened weight is earned, though the cost remains relatively quiet.

    Silas’s motivation—rebellion against linear time and desire to “reverse anything that mattered”—is clear and consistently expressed through his craft and choices. His interiority has distinctive texture (e.g., recognizing “latent radiance”), but his emotional life remains somewhat abstract; we don’t see what specific personal loss or longing makes this reversal costly. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire) are implied but not strongly dramatized in the activation beat. The closing sense of his life being “unmade” is powerful but lands more as concept than embodied emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s fear of dissolution versus the emergent desire for freedom is clearly articulated and her shift feels earned by the sequence of objects and realizations (“She looked like smoke, like possibility…”). Her emotional responses are particular rather than generic, and the grandmother backstory usefully sharpens her values. The advisor is more function than person, but his eerie charisma does provide a legible relational pressure. The only limitation is that Vera’s internal conflict resolves a touch smoothly, with relatively little on-page friction once the reinterpretation is offered.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—“to turn obstacles into instruments”—is specific, embodied, and consistently dramatized through her use of the orchard as an instrument. Her competence under pressure feels earned via prior practice mapping resonances, and her exhaustion at the end gives the endurance real cost. Internal contradiction is only lightly sketched (nervous system “firing warnings” vs. disciplined action); we don’t see much in-scene ambivalence or moral friction, which keeps this just shy of truly top-tier characterization. With no other on-page characters, there’s no relational crucible to deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, competence, and underlying attachment to Kade are clear and particular, and her choices directly drive the story. However, her interior conflict is underdeveloped: she rarely feels genuinely torn, and we don’t see contradictory impulses in play, only steady, capable resolve. Emotional embodiment leans more on worldbuilding texture than on her specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The final act (playing the whistles) feels motivated but not deeply costly on an emotional level, which limits the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Helena’s motivation is clear and rooted in her vocation and recent censorship, and her choice to sacrifice her career is coherent and earned. However, her “emotionally rational” nature remains more told than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page, so the decision feels principled but not deeply contested. Interiority is specific but leans a bit abstract at key beats (“she understood” rather than showing the struggle to accept the cost). The endurance of her principles is convincing, just not as psychologically complex as it might be at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Garrett’s vocation, grief, and ritual of hiding notes give him distinct, specific interiority, and his perception of “interlaced absence” feels character-particular rather than generic. His primary motivation—preserving vanished lives through technical work—is clear and consistently enacted. However, internal contradiction is relatively mild; he moves with calm, resolved purpose rather than being actively torn, so the emotional cost reads as elegiac more than sharply conflictual. The final choice to leave the note is earned but feels like continuing an existing pattern rather than a pressured new turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motive (uncovering the truth of the flooding and his grandmother’s role) is clear, consistent, and drives all his choices, and his methodical temperament is well-drawn. Interiority is specific enough—his anger and determination at the archive feel earned—but he remains largely unconflicted, with little contradiction or moral friction on the page. The clearest revealing micro-choice is his decision to prioritize “the most damning documents” and pocket the stamp. The cost of his stance is implied for tomorrow rather than felt in this scene, which keeps the arc from landing in a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s grief and drive to find a vessel for it are clear, specific, and consistent, and her actions—shifting from plain paper cranes to gem-hearted lantern-cranes, teaching others, finishing the thousandth—are all strongly motivated. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory and craft detail rather than labels. The main limitation is that contradictory impulses (e.g., desire to hold on vs. need to let go) stay mostly implicit rather than being dramatized in sharp, in-scene tension. The final endurance/acceptance is earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amal’s motivation—grief transmuted into obsessive cosmological revenge—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice, from staying on the failing observatory to focusing the geode on the critical mass. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressing…scarred hands,” “screaming equations into the dark”), with a credible internal split between rational caution and nihilistic elation. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper on-page contradiction or dilemma at the end; she never seriously entertains not pushing forward, so the final stance costs her little in newly dramatized terms.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s characterization is clear, specific, and grounded in her past as a military drone pilot whose current work doubles as a spiritual search; her choice to help the pilgrim and then to “add our frequency to theirs” feels motivated by that history. Her interiority is mostly embodied and concrete (the chip resonating with her own “gaps”), though the emotional conflict stays relatively gentle and could benefit from one sharper, riskier contradiction or flaw on the page. The pilgrim is thinner but still functional as a foil, mainly there to bring the chip and the grandmother’s mythos. The final stance shift—reframing belonging as resonance—is earned, but the personal cost could be more explicitly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s guilt, professional self-justification, and slow reorientation toward telling the truth are all cleanly motivated and consistent. The internal conflict between honoring Iris’s intention and honoring Clara’s need is credible and present on the page. Clara’s quiet persistence and her mother’s fear of “hope” sketch a complex family dynamic with minimal strokes. The main limitation is that Maren’s emotional progression, while clear, resolves a bit smoothly for the moral tangle at hand.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivations and interiority are rich and consistent—her method, the drawer pull, and her refusal to rush terms all align with a deeply felt ethic. Chen is sketched more lightly but still has clear pressure from above and a credible shift when he pockets the pull. Their side‑by‑side posture and moon-phase method effectively dramatize status and relationship dynamics. The final choice to demand “real histories” from their superiors feels fully earned and carries visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s regret, caution, and latent longing are clearly established and feel psychologically grounded, with the broken compass and the aborted engagement giving her history weight. Her contradictory impulses—toward safety and toward James/adventure—are live in the present scene and resolved through a concrete choice. The emotional cost of lost years and past cowardice is legible without self-exoneration. The only minor weakness is that some realizations (“This was what it meant when expectations collapse…”) verge on essayistic clarity rather than fully dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s characterization is sharp and specific: the post-scrub moral void, her pattern-reading habits, and her jaded drive toward some unnamed feeling all track cleanly into the final choice. Her shift from seeking forgetting to seeking deliberate restitution feels earned by prior beats. Marcus is more functional and expositional, but his presence still reflects and pressures her core traits rather than replacing them. The only softness is that her final resolve edges toward neatness given how extreme her past is, though the story gestures at decades of work rather than instant redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s grief, reluctance, and love are sharply motivated and stay consistent; the tension between “stubbornly human” and her willingness to transform is well dramatized during the ritual. Her internal conflict—cells crying out to remain unchanged while she lets go—is credible and carries cost. The brother is more a luminous presence than a fully realized character, but that suits the length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nadia’s motivation—guilt over missed time with her infant—drives every choice from the ascent to the final vow, and her cartomancy practice is integrated with that need. Interiority is specific (the traced gap between hands, the weeping in the kitchen) and contradictions are credible: she both loves her work and despises what it’s cost. The change at the end (accepting irrecoverable loss and choosing future presence) feels earned. A slightly tidier emotional resolution than her turmoil warrants keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ren’s pacifism, guilt, and grief are specific and embodied (the pendant’s warmth, the physical act of stitching), and their final move—refusing to fight while also refusing to abandon—feels earned. The internal contradiction between “steadfast pacifism” and awareness of prior cowardice is clear, though the struggle in the final confrontation is a bit frictionless. Emotional labels are mostly avoided in favor of concrete images. A touch more messiness or hesitation at the threshold would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris feels specific and grounded—her fallen-philanthropist history, tactile relationship to textures, and habit of collecting lightning bugs all individualize her. The contradiction between "I'm not seeking anything" and her clear attraction to this moment gives her a subtle, believable tension. However, the internal conflict softens quickly once the prophecy is named, so the final understanding costs her relatively little on the page. The old woman is effective but functions mainly as a thematic mouthpiece rather than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is sharply sketched: competent, sly, and “calmly inventive,” with concrete behaviors (embedding codes in the sundial, orchestrating the blackout) that align with her role as lock sentinel. Her motivation to subvert the Council is clear and consistent. What’s missing at this tier is genuine inner friction or felt fear under pressure—she glides through the scene almost too smoothly, so we don’t see contradictory impulses tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaela’s motivation (the promise to her sister and need to decode the change) is clear and consistent, and her eel-herder background and mathematical intuition feel specific and lived-in. The curse provides genuine internal pressure—she’s competent but fallible, with visions that mislead as often as they help. The emotional turn from burdened seeker to responsible guide is earned by what we’ve seen of her obsession and isolation. I would have liked one sharper, embodied moment of conflicted impulse (e.g., temptation to abandon the work) under peak pressure to push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s motivation is sharp and particular—censorship sharpening her resolve to “understand the cartography of scars” and weaponize it against erasure. Her internal contradiction (furious yet tranquil, patient yet radical) feels embodied in concrete choices: building the darkroom, waiting for the storm apex, finally opening the envelope. The move from personal/artistic resistance to accepting evidence of state violence is a credible, character-driven deepening rather than a flip. The only limitation is that we don’t see a strong, specific cost yet beyond implied danger and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theodora’s motives and values are clear and consistent, and her mechanical arm is well-integrated into both combat and ideology. Venn has legible status, pressure, and a small but real shift from rigid authority to cautious curiosity. Interiority is relatively light and leans on articulated ideals more than embodied contradiction, so emotional texture under pressure remains somewhat abstract. Still, the relationship dynamic functions well as the crucible for the scene’s central choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Solomon and Marcus are both sharply etched, with concrete motives (bus tokens, anarchist poetry, “blooming resistance”) and a lived-in relationship. The identity-molting trait plus his attachment to the letters give him texture beyond the archetypal drifter. The culminating choice to mulch the letters and “maybe stay Solomon” is emotionally plausible, though the internal conflict could be rendered with a bit more friction or doubt for true top-tier depth. Overall, the characterization feels specific and humane but not yet blisteringly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and coherent—his invisibility, hunger to be seen, and complicated feelings toward his parents all track cleanly into his choice to walk through and then to return changed. The piano-as-survival trait and his refusal to collapse into sentimentality feel character-particular. His final decision to play only his own compositions is earned by what we’ve seen, though the internal conflict could be slightly thornier or riskier to hit the absolute top tier. No relationships are dramatized on the page, so his dynamics with others remain largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s role, training, and core drive are clear and consistent, and her blend of scientific rigor and quasi-spiritual duty feels specific rather than generic. The internal tension between her “empirically whimsical” faith and “luminous doubt” is well set up and returned to at the end. However, her conflict remains relatively clean—no serious flaws, blind spots, or morally fraught choices complicate her path—so the arc feels more affirmed than challenged. A touch more embodied, idiosyncratic reaction under pressure would deepen her beyond functionally admirable.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marisol’s grief, anger, and dawning self-implication are clearly rendered, especially around the remembered bedroom scene and her admission, “I wanted her to say she was sorry.” The internal turn from blame to shared responsibility is believable if a bit swift. Takeshi is effective but archetypal—the gentle, aphoristic mentor with limited complication or shadow. Emotions are mostly embodied, but a few beats tilt toward abstract statement rather than showing the contradictions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara is a compelling focalizer whose professional expertise (neutron stars) creates a distinct, rigid filter for processing grief. The internal conflict—between her inherited impulse for control and the reality of "messy becoming"—is dramatized effectively through her observations. The shift in stance is earned and signaled by the physical action of leaving the dust on her hands.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    The character's reframing of her trauma—realizing she was merely "geography" and "infrastructure" rather than a personal target—is a sophisticated, non-obvious psychological beat. This shift from searching for providential meaning to accepting cold utility creates deep, specific interiority that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marina’s motivation is clearly defined, and her backstory effectively informs her present obsession. However, she lacks active internal contradiction or struggle in the scene; her path is certain, and the success of the experiment feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice or overcome doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Meridian is a compelling focalizer whose internal landscape perfectly mirrors the setting. Her realization of past error ("inadvertently stubborn") drives a genuine pivot in tactics, creating a strong agency arc. The emotional weight of her "decades" of failure provides sufficient grounding for the swift resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira is a competent, noble leader, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She functions primarily as a vehicle for the moral rather than a character making difficult trade-offs with visible costs. Her "flawless" leadership lowers the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with genuine agency or struggle; her competence is absolute, facing no internal resistance or blind spots. The interaction with the woman lacks interpersonal friction, as the stranger trusts and obeys immediately, reducing the character dynamics to a mechanical exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Miriam's interiority is rendered with high specificity, and her motivation to understand the "texture of time" coherently drives the narrative. The emotional arc is smooth—her acceptance ("no fear, only reverence") at the climax feels slightly too perfectly calibrated, lacking the gritty resistance or human hesitation that would heighten the felt cost of her dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s internal state is vivid, but the "choreography" of her chains feels aestheticized rather than an embodied struggle of three years' imprisonment. The lead soldier functions as a plot device; his rapid pivot from antagonist to ally lacks on-page friction or established motivation beyond the prop cue.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira is a compelling focalizer whose inverted synesthesia functions not just as a quirk but as the engine of her agency and craft. Her internal landscape is rich and consistent, though the "patient mathematics" of her cancer serves more as atmospheric pressure than a source of active friction against her immediate goal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a defined protagonist with a clear skill set, but her internal pivot from thief to witness feels instantaneous and frictionless. The emotional arc reads as a seamless ascent to enlightenment rather than a struggle with the loss of her former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is clear but static; Mira's desire to "craft safe zones" is explained via interior exposition rather than tested by difficult choices. The "narrating to herself" habit establishes voice but feels somewhat performative without deeper psychological friction. The lack of contradictory impulses acting in-scene leaves the character feeling curated rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is clear but articulated through diagnostic speech ("vulnerability... that's the real power") rather than subtextual action. The protagonist's competence relies on a "Batman gambit" revealed in dialogue rather than a difficult choice made under immediate pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren is a coherent focalizer with clear interiority, but her motivation lacks urgent, embodied friction. While her backstory implies sacrifice, her on-page experience is largely observational; she faces no contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices, resulting in a static emotional arc that resolves too easily into a smile at the apocalypse.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    J-7’s interiority is distinct, blending robotic precision ("microscopic variations") with genuine philosophical hunger. The transition from the "terrible loop" of questioning to the "patient accumulation" of the ending demonstrates a profound internal arc. The "remarkably composed" trait is not just a label but a governing constraint that shapes how J-7 handles the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is clear but delivered through heavy-handed exposition rather than action. Viktor’s confession utilizes diagnostic label-speak ("I've hidden behind official language"), stripping the scene of subtext and emotional realism. Mira’s internal state relies on generic somatic markers ("hand trembled") rather than distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer with clear agency, but the apprentice functions largely as an expository sounding board. Her internal state is stable rather than pressured, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or contradictory impulse that would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    Renna is defined by her role and the "obliging" trait, but this trait generates no friction; she obliges Voss, then immediately resumes her secret work without consequence. Voss serves as a convenient catalyst who accepts the impossible discovery instantly, removing potential interpersonal conflict. The emotional arc is stated ("afraid to show anyone") rather than dramatized through hesitation or a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    Celeste is a passive vessel for the concept rather than a realized character; her identity ("in-between") is labeled via exposition rather than shown through difficult choices. The motivation ("lately inspired") feels imposed by the prompt rather than arising from a desperate, character-specific need.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s professional competence serves as the crucible for her emotional arc; the conflict between her "fault-tolerant" past and the new "marginal" philosophy forces a tangible change in tactics (recalibrating sensors). Her grief is not just felt but operationalized into a new method of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s internal state ("drowsy alertness") is well-rendered, and her motivation is clear. However, her arc is static; the climax confirms her existing worldview ("religiously skeptical") rather than forcing a difficult choice or transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is a static vessel for the story's philosophy rather than a character under pressure; she displays no internal contradictions or conflicting desires. Her motivation is stated clearly ("to witness change without judgment") but faces no resistance, resulting in a serene procession rather than a dramatic arc. The lack of struggle or difficult choices leaves her emotional landscape flat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.3)
    Diane represents a stock "busy executive" archetype whose profound estrangement evaporates instantly upon hearing a song, lacking the necessary psychological groundwork or resistance to make the transformation credible. The protagonist acts primarily as a facilitator with a flat emotional baseline, observing rather than engaging in a conflict that tests her specific "mellow" traits.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is a coherent vessel for the concept but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses on the page. She observes and records without facing a dilemma or paying a personal cost; her "purpose" meets no resistance, resulting in a static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    Margaret’s internal landscape is rendered with specificity, particularly the jazz metaphor which grounds her motivation. However, she remains largely reactive to the stranger's exposition, and her final acceptance feels slightly too comfortable ("familiar, comfortable, strange"), lacking a sharper, more disruptive felt cost for such a life-altering revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.7)
    Micah is a distinct, competent professional defined clearly by his unique tools and philosophy. However, his mastery renders the conflict somewhat static; he experiences no significant internal doubt or high-stakes trade-off, making the victory feel low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and clearly motivated by the specific "homesickness" attribute. Her dedication to the ritual is felt, though the lack of a contradictory impulse or a harder choice beyond "write faster" keeps the character engagement in the efficient-but-static band. The motivation ("conductor of unheard symphonies") is explicitly stated rather than purely dramatized, but it fits the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s realization of her own corrosion provides a functional turning point, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("labyrinth of self," "fractured selves") rather than embodied emotion. The resolution is slightly weakened because the prop validates her choice immediately, reducing the weight of her solitary decision.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira's characterization relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Her motivation (defeating numbness) is stated rather than shown through a specific moment of acute struggle or failure, and her success feels inevitable rather than earned by navigating contradictory impulses in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is a coherent, meticulous protagonist whose calm demeanor fits the story's tone. However, the use of diagnostic labeling ("Maren's credibly curious nature") and summary verbs for thought processes ("intuited the fuller picture") flattens her interiority during key beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is excellent; Dalton's profession as a lantern broker deeply informs his interiority ("read what illumination revealed") and frames the resolution ("light in a careful vessel"). The emotional logic—testing grief against chemistry—is rigorous and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivations are clear, but the voices feel indistinct; both speak in polished, philosophical abstracts that serve the theme rather than revealing individual personality. The dialogue leans heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("time had texture," "chose freedom over certainty"), turning the characters into archetypes (Poet vs. Scientist) rather than embodied people under pressure. The emotional connection feels hasty, lacking the friction of genuine stranger dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a competent vehicle for the concept rather than a character under pressure. While her "acoustic perception" enables the plot, she lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or a moment of difficult choice; her success is immediate and inevitable, with no personal cost paid for the magic she performs.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren's "Sin Eater" dynamic—absorbing residue at a cost to her authenticity—provides a compelling internal contour to the professional archetype. The "static electricity" trait effectively physicalizes empathy, grounding the magical element in bodily sensation rather than abstract powers.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is thin, relying on "whimsical attention" rather than urgent need. The immediate, friction-free alignment between strangers lacks the contradictory impulses or status negotiation required to make the relationship feel earned or authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's desire for belonging is stated rather than dramatized through friction; her acceptance by the community is immediate ("embraced her idea with enthusiasm"), removing potential interpersonal tension. The attribute "boldly sympathetic" appears as a label without forcing a difficult choice or trade-off in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is a competent and focused protagonist whose professional curiosity effectively drives the narrative. While her motivation is clear, her internal conflict remains mild; the "weight" of the pendant suggests a burden, but the personal cost of the final exchange feels more intellectual than visceral. She functions perfectly as a vehicle for the concept, though she lacks a deep, contradictory interiority that would push this into the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marius has a compelling backstory and motivation, but his journey lacks an on-page struggle; the resolution comes through a magical external validation rather than a difficult active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's internal state is clearly drawn, and her compassion is consistent. However, the pivotal transformation from "learning to disappear" to "wanting to matter" relies heavily on a summary-based epiphany triggered by the tape smell, which feels slightly rushed and convenient for a life-altering shift. The boy serves as a functional catalyst but lacks distinct agency beyond his reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer, but his transformation from obsessive controller to passive observer feels unearned due to a lack of on-page internal friction. The shift is smoothed over by summary rather than dramatized through an agonizing choice where his old habits actively fight back.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character interiority is palpable, effectively grounding the abstraction of "threshing meaning" in physical exhaustion. The shift from isolation to communal ritual feels slightly accelerated, with the protagonist reading the net-mender's "tremor" as a diagnostic insight rather than a purely visceral interaction. However, the choice to sleep after the exchange acts as a solid, earned physiological release.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Vera is distinct, but her pivotal shift from fear to rapture relies on passive observation rather than active testing or struggle. The internal realization is told ("understanding crystallized") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice, making the emotional resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maris functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character, defined by her competence and role rather than by internal conflict or difficult choices. Her singular motivation lacks the friction of competing desires, and her success is achieved through summarized labor rather than dramatized struggle in the moment. The lack of a scene-based crucible prevents the reader from witnessing her character traits under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara is a competent focalizer, but her journey lacks internal friction or genuine struggle; "trembling certainty" conveniently resolves potential conflict before it starts. The final choice to accept her grandmother's truth feels inevitable rather than weighed against a competing desire, resulting in a "chosen one" arc with no visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s internal landscape of burnout and guardedness is sharply drawn, creating a strong emotional baseline. The transition from skepticism to belief is earned through the visceral experience of the tile, though the &quot;vision download&quot; resolves her internal conflict a bit too efficiently, bypassing a moment of active struggle or doubt in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is deeply rooted in specific backstory (the funeral), transforming the "bored immortal" trope into a compelling quest for meaning. The shift from ennui to urgency is earned, and the internal state is rendered with embodied precision.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's internal conflict—defined by her rejection of her father's deception while inheriting his tools—is sharply drawn and drives the central choice. The decision to log the retrieval truthfully rather than forge an excuse provides a strong character-defining moment that earns the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is a consistent, specialized vessel for the concept, fitting the fable-like mode. However, she lacks embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she "welcomes" the silence and performs her ritual without struggle, resulting in a static emotional landscape that limits dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her internal state is static, lacking contradictory impulses or present-tense struggle. The "whistleblower" backstory explains her condition but does not drive a difficult choice in the current narrative window. Her acceptance of erasure is total, which flattens the dramatic potential of her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marina’s internal state is well-drawn, and her backstory informs her present actions effectively. However, the transition from lifelong skeptic to believer feels frictionless; she enters the scene already wanting to believe, so the epiphany meets no internal resistance or contradictory impulse on the page. The "skeptical heart" is mentioned but not dramatized as an active obstacle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is defined by her role, but her internal conflict is reported ("tearing her apart") rather than dramatized through hesitation or error. The "orderly intuitive" trait appears as a label to justify a convenient epiphany rather than a difficult cognitive process showed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation to preserve the crater is clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, her interiority relies on somewhat stock sentimental tropes ("asked why stars died") rather than specific, embodied struggle. The connection to the grandfather provides emotional grounding but feels slightly derivative.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara is a competent focalizer, but she lacks the contradictory impulses or internal friction required for higher bands. Her motivation ("heartfelt dedication," "magnetic calm") is labeled rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her competence faces no character-specific challenge that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara is a competent focalizer whose professional drive anchors the narrative. However, the "dry-witted" aspect is underplayed, appearing only in a single opening line. Her acceptance of the radical hydrological shift is intellectually satisfying but lacks significant internal resistance or personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype, lacking internal contradiction or embodied emotion; she functions as a plot device to fix the external problem without facing a difficult choice or paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s internal pivot to override her instinct for self-preservation is a strong, defining micro-choice. However, the emotional bond with Thalia relies heavily on the convenient "memory flood" mechanism rather than interaction, making the connection feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus is a compelling, specific focalizer whose internal conflict—silence versus the inherited weight of lies—drives the narrative. The psychological burden of his father's legacy is dramatized well through his refusal to speak during the escape. The shift from "chasing hush" to "becoming hush" feels slightly abstract as a climax mechanism, but the final resolve to speak earns the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions primarily as a passive vessel for the backstory, observing and receiving explanations rather than driving action through choice. Her acceptance of the "eternal night" lacks a dramatized alternative or visible struggle, making the resolution feel like compliance rather than a hard-won stance. The "ghost bride" serves as an exposition delivery system rather than a character with distinct, conflicting desires in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara functions more as a mythic archetype than a fully realized character, with her primary discovery driven by unconscious sleepwalking rather than active agency. The transition from rule-breaker to community leader is smooth and lacks internal conflict or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s internal landscape is rich, and her motivation to repair her "internal architecture" drives the narrative effectively. However, emotions are occasionally labeled ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") rather than fully embodied in reaction, and the introspection sometimes leans on summary over dramatic present-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    Maya is a competent, professional protagonist who serves the story's concept well, but she lacks the internal contradiction or immediate, high-stakes pressure required for a higher score. Her motivation is stated clearly through backstory rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page choice or emotional struggle. She performs her role efficiently, but the absence of a moment where her competence is truly tested limits the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.4)
    Character motivation and method are perfectly integrated; the "fool" persona is an active tool, not just a trait. Her internal contradiction—feigned simplicity vs. logistical brilliance—drives the scene and earns the final choice to intervene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    Isla’s motivation is clear and her internal pivot from defensive fury to empathy is well-earned within the vision sequence. However, the emotional heavy lifting is partly outsourced to the magical object and the convenient arrival of the sister's letters, which dilutes Isla’s agency in the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character motivation is clear and poignant, particularly Maya’s shift from observer to participant. However, emotional states are often labeled via summary ("Shared anxieties bloomed," "lotus-hearted ache") rather than fully embodied in action. The reliance on diagnostic phrases to establish connection reduces the visceral impact of the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motivation (reclaiming joy) is clear and grounded in action. However, the emotional payoff involving strangers "weeping with recognition" feels unearned and overly calibrated, offering instant external validation that deflates the personal intimacy of the moment. The internal shift is legible, but the "pensive mirth" label acts as a diagnostic summary rather than fully embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marta’s internal conflict between preservation and curiosity is compelling, and her professional traits clearly shape her interaction with the anomaly. The pivot from fear to "strange liberation" relies on diagnostic telling rather than embodied reaction, slightly muting the emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.3)
    Malachi functions as a charismatic archetype but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his success feels predetermined. The dialogue occasionally drifts into performed speech making the emotions feel stated rather than embodied. No significant micro-choice forces him to reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's interiority is rendered with high specificity, grounding her immortal weariness in concrete desires ("photosynthesize pain"). The shift from solitary writer to collaborative gardener is earned through the interaction with Mira, creating a credible emotional arc. Motivation is clear and drives the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    Miren is a distinct focalizer with clear agency and a coherent internal landscape. However, her interiority relies heavily on the story's metaphorical conceit (feelings as objects) rather than embodied reaction, creating a layer of distance. The shift from preservation to adaptation is earned, though the emotional logic of her "Severance" limitations versus her rich internal narration contradicts itself slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s internal motivation is clear and grounded, but Kael’s emotional pivot is too rapid to feel earned. His transition from "unreadable" and harboring "hurt" to enthusiastic collaboration happens in a single beat without sufficient resistance or on-page processing, reducing the relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena is a competent focalizer who drives the puzzle-solving, but she lacks internal conflict or distinct personality traits beyond her function. Her motivation to "harmonize values" is stated rather than felt through struggle, and she pays no emotional or physical cost for the resolution. The character work is functional for a procedural but lacks the depth required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation is compelling; the tension between the constructed persona ("trust came naturally") and the traumatic reality drives the narrative engine effectively. The internal conflict is embodied well through the physical balancing act, though the shift to confession feels slightly rapid given the depth of the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and specifically drawn, grounding the surreal setting in genuine emotional stakes regarding her family's collapse. The motivation to understand "thresholds" drives the narrative effectively, though the epiphany relies partly on inherited traits rather than purely active struggle. The emotional logic of "irreversibility" lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict is stated ("outsider") rather than dramatized through friction; her validation arrives too easily via Chen’s immediate acceptance. The lack of contradictory impulses or a difficult choice flattens her arc into a linear path to comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and drives the arc toward a meaningful shift in stance. However, interiority relies on oxymoronic labels ("melancholy optimism," "cheerful gloom") and stock gestures ("smile that didn't quite reach her eyes") rather than fresh, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist displays "perfect competence" without internal struggle or meaningful cost, reducing her to a functional archetype rather than a living character. There is no contradiction or flaw; she calculates and succeeds effortlessly, which alienates the reader and lowers the stakes to zero. Motivation is stated rather than tested by genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael demonstrates clear agency and motivation, with the choice to tattoo herself serving as a strong, character-defining culmination of her exile. However, internal conflict is minimal; her certainty is absolute from the start, lacking the contradictory impulses or friction that would deepen the characterization beyond the archetype of the rebel.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Samuel is a consistent but static protagonist whose "reading between the lines" attribute is established via summary rather than dramatized interaction. He faces no internal contradictions or difficult micro-choices on the page; he simply executes a pre-formed plan with quiet competence, resulting in a character who feels more like a vehicle for observation than a distinct agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is legible, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("topography of trauma") rather than embodied feeling. The character's realization feels intellectualized through abstract concepts like "universal language" rather than earned through visceral, present-tense struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya acts as a consistent focalizer for the premise, but her journey is one of observation rather than high-stakes decision-making. The narrative asserts her internal conflict (logic vs. dreams) but resolves it through external magical validation rather than a difficult, character-defining choice with visible cost. The epiphany feels granted by the environment rather than wrestled from personal limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara serves primarily as a vessel for the prompt's concept rather than a fully realized agent. Her motivation is stated explicitly via exposition ("Mara knew something they didn't") rather than dramatized through struggle, and her "sensitively perceptive" trait feels inserted as a label rather than demonstrated through unique action.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character motivation is deeply integrated with the central conceit of the "borrowed heartbeat," driving the ritual with clear, desperate agency. Aina's internal contradiction between her "perceptively calm" exterior and the inner pulse is effectively dramatized in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mirena’s motivation is deeply felt and anchored in the physical prop of the clipboard. However, the secondary characters feel slightly archetypal, and their transition from deep-seated hatred to cooperation occurs with a speed that relies more on the ritual’s convenience than complex internal shifting.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is clearly defined, but the characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("amoral in the way that gods are amoral," "secretly sentimental") rather than dramatized behavior. While the shaking hands offer a moment of embodied emotion, the internal landscape is mostly summarized through exposition. The "sentiment" trait is stated as a fact to explain motivation rather than emerging organically from the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Celestine’s motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction; her triumph over "conformity" feels idealized rather than earned through a painful trade-off or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is a distinct presence, but his defining trait ("uncommonly serene") is told rather than dramatized under pressure. His passivity during the climax—failing to notice a prop being taken from his active performance—undermines his competence as a performer.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sera is a well-defined vessel for the story's concept, and her motivation to witness is established immediately. However, she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; her emotional journey is unified and perfectly calibrated to the theme without the struggle or messy interiority that characterizes higher-band characterization. She functions more as an observer-narrator than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maren is a distinct focalizer with a clear backstory, but her internal arc feels summarized rather than dramatized in the present moment. The emotional "thaw" is explained retrospectively rather than emerging through resistance or difficult choices during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the concept rather than an agent of change. She obeys the directive immediately and sleeps through the external threat (the storm) without genuine struggle, contradictory impulses, or a felt cost to her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s characterization is anchored well by the specific, embodied detail of counting candle stubs, which effectively dramatizes her frugality and the stakes of resource scarcity. Her internal motivation is clear, though at times conveyed through expository summary ("Her motivation had always been singular") rather than purely through action. The emotional resonance of her isolation is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s "scheming pacifist" persona is a strong hook, but her manipulation reads more like standard therapy than high-stakes strategy. Marcus’s resistance crumbles too easily upon seeing the vision, making his transformation feel like a convenient plot beat rather than a hard-won character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eliane is a competent protagonist with a clear worldview ("firmly grounded") that is meaningfully challenged by the necessity of connecting with the ethereal dream. Her internal micro-arc—risking her grounding to "erode the boundary" for the sake of the capture—is strong, though her success feels slightly inevitable due to high competence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the reconciliation happens too easily given the established estrangement ("I didn't want to be found" dissolves in two exchanges). The prompt attribute "endearingly feisty" appears as a narrator label ("nature showed in how she crossed her arms") rather than a demonstrated trait, flattening the secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara acts with agency to solve the puzzle, but her emotional reaction to the climax—smiling at the realization she is her own grandfather—feels under-dramatized. The acceptance of such a paradoxical, identity-erasing fate lacks the visceral confusion or horror expected from a "bewildered" character, reducing the felt human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is a competent functionary of the setting rather than a character under pressure; her success is immediate and derived from established expertise rather than struggle or adaptation. The lack of internal conflict or vulnerability limits emotional engagement, leaving her as a calm mechanic fixing a machine.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.3)
    Isla’s internal arc—from the desperate agent of "recapture" to the yielding subject of "release"—is profound and tightly executed. The shift from "discoverer" to "discovered" provides a distinct, earned resolution to her identity crisis, grounded in the specific mechanics of the story's world.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marin is defined primarily by her competence and functional role rather than internal contradiction or struggle. Her key trait, "warmly methodical," appears as a narrator label rather than a behavioral constraint that forces a difficult trade-off under pressure. The characterization remains static; she begins and ends as an adept problem-solver without emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The mapkeeper is a competent focalizer whose interiority is rich with backstory but lacks active internal conflict in the present moment. She solves the problem using established skills without facing a contradictory impulse or a character-testing dilemma, making her function more as a vehicle for the ritual than a dynamic agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mera is a distinct, consistent focalizer with clear motivation. Her interiority regarding the "language of pattern" is compelling. However, the shift from retrocognition to precognition at the closure feels like a reward granted by the author rather than a development earned by the character's on-page choices or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maris is a distinct focalizer with a consistent worldview that motivates her urgency. The realization at the end feels earned by her internal logic, though the dialogue with Davin functions somewhat transparently to externalize her thematic stance rather than arising from organic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mara functions as an archetypal savior with no internal contradiction or meaningful flaws; she arrives with the solution and executes it without struggle. The trait "ambient awareness" acts as a convenient shortcut for empathy, bypassing the need for genuine relational discovery or conflict. Her motivation is stated abstractly ("to defy gravity") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choice or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mei’s interiority is consistent and the shift in her understanding is grounded in her established worldview. The characterization leans slightly on told traits ("warmly observant quality") rather than purely dramatized behavior in the opening beats, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lina’s internal landscape is drawn with precision, grounding the fantastic premise in a coherent emotional reality (claustrophobia vs. openness). Her motivation is clear and consistent, though the stakes remain somewhat cerebral; the cost of her success is relatively low, lacking a sharp moment of sacrifice or painful trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is a competent, stable focalizer who fits her role perfectly, but she lacks internal friction or personal stakes beyond professional duty. She functions primarily as a static guide for the secondary character's arc, with her own cost (seven years of isolation) stated in summary rather than dramatized through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vess functions effectively as an archetype, but her interiority is thin; the emotional reaction to the mural (tears) feels unearned by prior on-page struggle. The "wisely adventurous" trait is inserted as a tell rather than demonstrated through complex decision-making, and her final choice lacks the friction of genuine temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s immediate pivot from isolationist to mentor lacks sufficient internal friction, reducing her agency to plot convenience. Sienna serves as a compliant thematic prop who accepts the "cost" without the resistance required to make the stakes feel genuine.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s transition from victim to reality-anchor is clear and grounded in her backstory, providing a solid emotional arc. However, the attribute "virtuously mischievous" feels inserted as a label to satisfy a prompt rather than organically demonstrated; the climactic action is one of stoic endurance and self-sacrifice, which clashes with the declared trait of mischief.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara is defined primarily by backstory decisions rather than present-tense agency; her internal state is described via labels ("eloquently silent") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s transition from profound isolation to active agency is charted clearly, anchored by the specific memory of the liege. Interiority is distinct ("trying to transmute her grief"), though the shift from three years of silence to immediate mastery of the diagrams feels slightly frictionless. The emotional arc lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration, exchanging withdrawal for a new, active allegiance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sarah's internal landscape is drawn with care, balancing grief with methodical purpose. However, the emotional arc is slightly linear; her transition from "broken heart" to "tactful hope" feels inevitable rather than hard-won through conflicting impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions as a competent archetype rather than a nuanced individual; her actions are driven by plot necessity, and she lacks the internal contradiction required for depth. She succeeds without facing a difficult trade-off or character-defining sacrifice, making her triumph feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation shifts credibly from routine to duty, anchored by a visible cost at closure (abandoning her public audience). However, the pivot relies heavily on a convenient memory retrieval ("grandmother's voice surfaced") to explain the magic system rather than active discovery, which dampens the agency of the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    Miren is defined clearly by her obsession, but her journey is purely intellectual; she faces no emotional friction or difficult trade-off. The epiphany feels like a reward for mere presence rather than a hard-won insight born of struggle. The transformation at the end reads as a pure upgrade without the requisite "felt cost" to make the character arc resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ellis is a clearly defined protagonist with a coherent worldview ("tinkerer as witness"), but her primary trait—"uncertainly certain"—is delivered as a narrative label rather than dramatized through difficult choices. While her curiosity is evident, she faces no significant internal opposition or competence failures that would deepen her characterization; she moves through the story with relatively low-friction agency.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation (redemption) drives the action, but the emotional arc is overly tidy and lacks internal contradiction. Characters speak in thematic thesis statements ("identity emerged from choices") rather than natural, stressed dialogue, and the resolution feels emotionally frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is a competent focalizer with a clear objective, but her defining trauma (the daughter) appears as expository backstory rather than a dynamic pressure on the present moment. The "modestly fearless" trait acts as a label rather than a driver of difficult choices; her interaction with the ghost is procedural and smooth, lacking the friction or internal cost that reveals deep character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kira's arc from hating her "calibrated" body to accepting it as a tool for mapping mercy is compelling and fully realized. The internal conflict is embodied through the proprioceptive details, and the final renunciation of a perfect equation is an earned emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal friction or distinct flaws; her success is smooth and unhindered by doubt. Motivation is stated ("honoring overlooked histories") but not tested, as external obstacles are removed for her (e.g., the vendor waiving the price). The lack of struggle or meaningful trade-offs leaves her characterization somewhat flat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marcus functions as a passive vessel for the plot; he accepts the supernatural immediately without internal conflict or doubt. He faces no difficult choices or personal costs, making the interaction transactional rather than emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margritte functions well as a fable archetype, but she lacks internal friction or distinct personality beyond her role; her "cryptic by necessity" trait is stated but undermined by her tendency to speak in clear, didactic aphorisms.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Matthias is a distinct focalizer with a coherent internal landscape; the shift from revolutionary to scholar feels grounded in his current actions. His motivation to reclaim the history of the "vanished architects" is palpably felt in his interaction with the shard. The "poetically inclined" attribute is integrated into his worldview rather than tacked on, though the revolutionary past relies slightly on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    Cornelius is a distinct, consistent archetype with a clear skillset, but he functions without internal contradiction or high-stakes agency. His defining trait (wilting near dishonesty) acts as a passive magical enabler rather than a flaw that forces a difficult choice or cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s internal landscape is rich, though her motivation is occasionally articulated through abstract summary ("thirsts couldn't be satisfied by answers") rather than purely dramatized friction. Her capability with psychometry feels slightly convenient—a skill declared to enable the plot—but her final choice to leave the compass demonstrates genuine agency and character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Iris is clearly defined as an artist with a specific motivation ("hunting virgin beaches"), but her pivotal epiphany feels unearned. The internal shift is triggered instantaneously by a magical object rather than arising from a pressure-cooked decision or emotional struggle, making the character's arc feel functional rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina is a functional protagonist, but her internal landscape is static; the "quietly driven" trait is told rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The resolution comes from an external epiphany rather than a pressure-tested character decision, and the "cost" (working through one night) is minimal for a residency of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The emotional pivot is clear, but the realization moment relies on diagnostic telling ("Maya understood her motivation clearly now") rather than embodied change. The internal shift is summarized with labels ("voice for encrypted voices") instead of being purely dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype of wisdom, effectively driving the theme, but lacks embodied vulnerability or internal conflict. Her superiority over the "mad" townsfolk feels unearned by on-page struggle, and her emotional experience is described through somewhat distant summaries rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s internal landscape is rich and coherent, blending her profession with her immediate crisis effectively. The motivation to decode the silence drives the narrative well, though the epiphany ("It wasn't foreboding... It was transition") feels slightly diagnostic rather than purely embodied, leaning on wisdom-archetype summary rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's specific expertise drives the resolution; the renunciation of the vortex is a deeply motivated character beat that validates her lineage. The internal state of "furiously tranquil" effectively anchors her disciplined rage and enables her measured response to the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira is a competent, grounded focalizer whose internal conflict between protocol and intuition drives the narrative. Her choice to reject the siren is a clear expression of agency, though the lack of on-page hesitation or struggle from the community in following her lead slightly undermines the perceived risk of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    Kael is a coherent vessel for the premise, but his interiority relies on abstract summary rather than embodied conflict. The emotional arc—from brokenness to healing—is smooth and linear, lacking the contradictory impulses or friction required for higher bands. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas is a well-realized focalizer with a distinct worldview ("voices became weapons") that motivates his initial isolation. The shift from avoidance to engagement is earned through his specific interest in the apiary's history, and his acceptance of the "keeper" role provides a satisfying character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    Marcus functions as a vehicle for the premise rather than an agent of dramatic choice; his motivation is clear, but he faces no internal contradiction or costly trade-off. He solves the problem by following instructions rather than through struggle or ingenuity, resulting in a passive protagonist at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya functions as a static archetype (the wise mentor) rather than a conflicted protagonist; she exists solely to dispense wisdom. The young man's transformation is rapid and frictionless, lacking the resistance or behavioral nuance of genuine grief. Dialogue feels therapeutic and functional rather than natural, serving as a delivery mechanism for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary rather than dramatized scenes, preventing access to Marina’s immediate interiority or contradictory impulses under pressure. While her motivation is stated, it lacks the friction of on-page decision-making; we are told she felt "brazen calm" rather than seeing it tested against the reality of her decline.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira's internal landscape is drawn with precision, balancing her established skepticism against the "crack" the visitors opened in her. The transition from academic detachment to visceral understanding is well-earned through the specific interaction with the setting and the amber. Her final stance—skepticism repurposed rather than abandoned—provides a satisfying, character-specific nuance to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Erasmus is a distinct, dignified presence, though he functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character under pressure. While his competence is satisfying, his internal landscape is somewhat static; he faces no significant dilemma or contradictory impulse that forces a costly choice beyond the physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Finder is a consistent focalizer with a clear skillset, but her internal landscape lacks friction; her transition from isolation to seeking connection is smooth and inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The dialogue leans toward exposition ("I'm ready to find the living now"), articulating motivation that should be subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s internal arc from pariah to explorer is clear and the emotional cost of the "anniversary" beat lands effectively. However, the shift to "freedom" feels slightly intellectualized—a stated realization rather than a visceral reaction to pressure—and the motivation is explicitly summarized rather than purely demonstrated through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character definition relies heavily on prompt labels ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice") rather than demonstrated behavior. While her internal anxiety is noted ("fingers trembled"), the lack of a difficult choice or genuine temptation makes her function more as a vessel for the plot than a complex agent. The "chivalrous thief" persona is asserted but not dramatized through actual theft or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is a compelling, specific focalizer; the shift from crisis actor to crisis historian offers deep, ironic interiority. The trait "benevolently ruthless" is excellent, manifesting in difficult choices with the survivors that prove her commitment. The only slight drag is the colleague, whose arrival feels somewhat functional—a device to prompt her final articulation of self rather than a fully fleshed antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    Isla is a sympathetic focalizer, but she functions primarily as a vessel for the premise rather than an agent of change. Her pivotal breakthrough relies entirely on a serendipitous accident (the falling feather) rather than a choice or skill she actively deploys, and the emotional resolution ("memories came flooding back, no longer painful") is summarized rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is resolved through diagnostic label-speak ("I was brilliant and cruel") rather than dramatized choice. The climax relies on a sudden, articulated epiphany that feels like therapy-speak rather than an earned psychological shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s internal conflict—her artistic defiance versus the weight of her guilt—is dramatized effectively through her attempt to manipulate the echoes. Her shift from rationalization ("innocently mischievous") to acceptance is earned by the failure of her tactic, creating a clear arc. The emotional cost is felt in her abandonment of the paints.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s habit of narrating her own actions is a brilliant device that externalizes her dissociation and coping mechanism, grounding the "uncertainty" trait in specific behavior. The character arc—from fearing her uncertainty to using it as the final, necessary ingredient—is coherent and effectively dramatized. The shift from passivity to agency feels earned within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina’s internal conflict—observer vs. participant—is clearly drawn and resolves through a decisive, embodied action (sitting in the water, ruining the clothes). The choice to abandon her "carefully maintained remove" is earned by the pressure of the setting and the shell's return. However, the reliance on Thomas's letter to articulate her motivation leans slightly on backstory rather than purely present-tense friction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mara’s emotional pivot is catalyzed primarily by the magical vial rather than internal agency, which externalizes the story’s central change. The shift from "righteous anger" to tenderness occurs via the scent's intervention ("stripped away the armor"), reducing the weight of her choice to apologize.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara is a coherent, atmospheric focalizer whose internal logic ("solace in malfunction") grounds the piece effectively. However, the scene depicts a routine success rather than a pressure-test of her character; she performs her competence without facing a dilemma that forces a new cost or revelation, resulting in a slightly static portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation is compelling, rooted in a specific, dramatized deficit (lack of privacy), and the neighbor flashback effectively grounds the stakes. The internal shift is legible, though the final emotional state feels slightly more summarized than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margit is a grounded, distinct protagonist with a clear worldview ("observing gaps") that colors her narration. Her motivation to decode the gesture is strong and personal, though her role in the resolution becomes somewhat passive as she receives the answers directly from the flower’s memory-dump rather than earning them through active deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer with a clear internal state (regret/solitude). However, the transition from decades of hesitation to the decisive act feels rushed; the emotional cost of abandoning his "careful solitude" is stated rather than dramatized through resistance or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's weariness is established with sensory weight ("disenchantment settled... like winter cold"), and the refusal of the ember grotto shows agency. However, her shift from despair to purpose relies heavily on the guide's didactic explanation rather than a dramatized internal crucible, softening the emotional cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is distinct and her internal shift is legible, but her climactic choice is undercut by the convenience of having the solution (the non-commercial suns) already prepared in her bag. She arrives effectively pre-transformed, reducing the on-page struggle to a confirmation of prior intent rather than a decision forged under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s internal landscape is compellingly fractured; the specific emotion of "jaded wonder" is excellently embodied, avoiding generic angst. The "jealousy" of her past self provides a sharp, character-specific anchor for the surreal premise, grounding abstract time-travel concepts in a visceral human reaction. The final resignation feels earned by the accumulation of "small impossibilities."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her internal shift relies heavily on diagnostic dialogue ("I used to think... But it was always about...") rather than embodied action. The epiphany feels verbally declaimed rather than emotionally earned through struggle, reducing the character to a vehicle for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character motivation is deeply embodied through the crystallization trait, grounding the arc in physical sensation. The transition from shame to agency is clear, though the pivot relies on a convenient backstory memory rather than an active discovery in the moment. The protagonist's internal state is vividly rendered, creating genuine empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character motivations are clear and the refusal to forgive adds genuine friction. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into self-diagnosis ("You always talked like that," "There's my metaphor-addicted friend"), which feels like the author flagging traits rather than the characters naturally embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael serves more as a philosophical vessel than a living character; his "desperation" is labeled rather than embodied in scene. The internal conflict is purely intellectual, and his epiphany arrives smoothly without a dramatized struggle or the friction of a flaw that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maren's internal landscape is rich, but the inciting decision relies on "instinct that felt like memory" rather than active causality, which feels convenient after seventeen years of stasis. The pivot to using the key lacks a grounded trigger in the present scene, weakening the agency behind the conceptual breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is competent, but her pivot from security professional to accomplice relies heavily on a coincidental recognition ("familiar stranger") rather than earned interaction. The connection feels convenient, bypassing the necessary friction of the conflict. While her backstory motivates the choice, the emotional shift happens too smoothly, lacking the visceral hesitation or internal struggle expected when risking one's career.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is exceptionally distinct; Mira’s "theoretical rebellion" evolves naturally into a responsible pedagogical mission (the syllabus). The internal contradiction of the father is mirrored poignantly in her own struggle, creating a deep, resonant psychological landscape that drives the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.8)
    Iris functions as a magical facilitator rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradiction, incompetence, or resistance. Her interventions succeed perfectly every time with no emotional or physical cost paid on the page, leaving her static. The lack of struggle or potential for failure drains the narrative of dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character motivation is explicitly labeled ("penance," "grief and exultation") rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. The protagonist's internal state is delivered via summary and diagnostic keywords ("mausoleum," "sanctuary") rather than embodied behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    Vera is a vivid presence, but her pivotal internal shift relies on diagnostic summarization ("looking for the cure for loneliness in logistics") rather than embodied emotion. The sudden shedding of her "desperately jocular" mask feels structurally convenient rather than earned by the immediate pressure of the scene. While the motivation is clear, the psychological resolution reads as a label applied to the character rather than a felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara is a distinct, sensory-grounded focalizer, and her internal state is clear. However, her journey lacks active agency beyond the initial decision to dowse; she follows a trail laid out for her rather than making difficult trade-offs or choices under pressure. The emotional arc is resolved through realization rather than a dramatized decision between conflicting values.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera possesses distinct interiority and a clear professional voice, but her emotional arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from deep guilt over a colony-wrecking error to philosophical acceptance feels unearned, as the "magic" of the pen allows her to bypass the difficult reckoning with her mistake's consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.0)
    Marina’s internal state of loss is legible, but her transformation relies heavily on Celeste acting as a didactic mentor figure rather than through Marina's own agency or resistance. The emotional arc feels instructional, moving from grief to acceptance without the messy, embodied struggle that characterizes high-stakes characterization. Celeste functions more as a plot device than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's motivation is clear, grounded in a compelling backstory of "destructive conservation." However, her "analytically intuitive" trait acts as a summary label rather than a demonstrated process in the scene; we are told she connects breadcrumbs rather than seeing her solve a specific puzzle on the page. The emotional beats, while high-stakes, occasionally rely on label-heavy interiority ("fierce tenderness") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Internal texture is strong, specifically the confusion of entangled ages ("five and eighty-three simultaneously"). However, the "quietly rebellious" trait is established by label rather than high-stakes action; the rebellion lacks external opposition or on-page risk, making her journey feel more like a ritual than a conflict-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira is a competent and distinct protagonist, and her motivation regarding her father is clearly established. However, her victory feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle; she outmaneuvers the antagonist so smoothly that the emotional cost of the risk remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motivation for the inciting act ("angry about something stupid") is insufficiently dramatized, reducing a life-threatening betrayal to a plot device. The transition from guilt to taking the guardian's place feels unearned by the brief interaction. The guardian functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marina functions as a benevolent archetype rather than a complex character; she lacks internal contradiction, and her "unspoken word" ability acts as a shortcut to interiority rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction. Her rebellion faces no skepticism or personal cost, leaving her agency untested by the pressure required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s internal conflict (dancer vs. weapon) is clear, but the mechanism of her transformation is convenient; the scrimshaw bypasses the "neural dampeners" too easily, rendering the story’s central constraint surprisingly porous without sufficient on-page struggle. The "furious love" motivation is stated more than dramatized in the early beats, relying on the ending to retroactively justify the internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is masterful; the specific coping mechanism of self-narration ("She lifts the plate...") vividly renders her dissociation. The cessation of this narration at the climax ("She didn't narrate this") signals a profound internal shift without needing exposition. The contradictory impulses—to preserve the bouquet vs. to whittle everything down—resolve in a earned, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyren functions more as a thematic vehicle than a conflicted protagonist. While her motivation is clear, she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful flaws; her journey is a frictionless ascent to enlightenment without visible psychological or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but her stated trait of being "innocently cunning" is asserted in narration rather than dramatized; she acts with direct, wise intention throughout. Fen's transformation—from forty years of rigid perfectionism to surrendering his worldview—happens with too little resistance or internal struggle to feel fully earned. The "sleepwalking" trait is told rather than shown in his initial behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    The Bell Ringer functions as a "magical helper" device rather than a character, possessing unexplained technical mastery ("fingers dancing... as though they'd designed it") that resolves the plot without struggle. Karim is passive, moving from resignation to acceptance with minimal internal friction or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is introspective and her grief is rendered with specific sensory details, establishing a clear internal landscape. However, the characterization remains static; she executes a task without facing a difficult choice or contradictory impulse on the page that would test her resolve or force a shift in her traits. The "subdued ardor" feels like a fixed state rather than a volatile emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a distinct, intellectually driven protagonist with clear interiority. However, the scene lacks interpersonal friction; Tobias serves more as a passive receptacle for her exposition than a force applying pressure, which limits the dramatic "crucible" effect of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maressa’s motivation—the seventeen-year search—is established early and pays off in a credible renunciation at the climax. The shift from obsession to rejection is earned by the horrific realization of the civilization's fate. However, her emotional state relies heavily on labeled paradoxes ("anguished joy") rather than embodied reactions, creating a slight distance during the pivotal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maren functions more as a thematic vessel than a fully realized character; her "regret" is stated in the narration rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page impulses. While her observation of Lyssa is sharp, her own internal stakes feel static, lacking a personal flaw or contradictory desire to drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's internal trajectory from paralysis to decisive action is well-dramatized, with her motivation rooted clearly in the conflict between integrity and care. The "relationships as crucible" element applies effectively to her bond with the animals, forcing a choice that redefines her definition of gentleness.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character motivation is deeply internalized yet vividly dramatized through the physical interaction with the scar and the ivy. The shift from guilt to acceptance is earned through the specific memory triggered by the coffee rings, grounding the epiphany in character history rather than abstract logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marina functions as a clear archetype with a defined purpose, but she lacks deep internal contradiction or personal vulnerability. Her shift from observer to "conductor" is a change in role rather than a hard-won character transformation, as her motivation remains largely abstract and philosophical rather than rooted in a specific, felt need or lack.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra is clearly defined as an archetype (the moonstruck dreamer), but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("madness," "longing," "grief") rather than contradictory impulses or grounded emotional specificity. She faces no hesitation or internal obstacle; the narrative is a linear execution of a known task, lacking a moment of doubt or conflicting desire to humanize the "chosen one" role.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's motivation ("cultivate the sparks") is singular and clear, driving the action effectively. However, she lacks internal contradiction or a moment of genuine struggle against her own limits in this scene; she performs a ritual competently and succeeds without a micro-choice that forces a trade-off, making the emotional arc feel slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael is a consistent observer, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("old trauma," "joy-maps") rather than embodied struggle. The realization of his own mental architecture feels like an unearned epiphany; he identifies his flaws (abandoning wonder) without a dramatized moment of resistance or cost that forces the change.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya functions as a passive vessel for the allegory rather than an active agent; she walks, listens, and accepts validation without enacting a difficult choice on the page. The powerful opening metaphor ("the leash") implies complex resentment or relief, but this depth is flattened by the story's swift pivot to unearned healing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marta's nerve regeneration offers a compelling somatic parallel to the hotel's silenced history, grounding her internal state effectively. However, the explicitly stated motivation ("to understand the cost of safety") reads more like a thematic thesis than a character-driven impulse, creating a slight distance in the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael is a distinct archetype with a clear goal, but she lacks internal friction; she is "content in her dissolution" from the start, leaving no room for a decision under pressure to alter her internal state. Her nobility is static rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice between conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya’s obsession is beautifully embodied in the tapping compulsion, which physically bridges her internal anxiety with the external tidal rhythm. Her motivation is sharp and professional, driven by a specific history (graduate student witnessing bleaching) that grounds the high-concept stakes in personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    Interiority is consistent, but the required trait "awkwardly confident" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through interaction or specific behavior. Emotions often rely on abstract summary ("righteousness without direction," "paradox of overwhelming peace") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s transition from insurgent destroyer to "gardener of futures" is compelling and grounds the fantastical elements in character history. However, her acceptance of the alien embryo arrives with relatively low internal resistance, smoothing over the "fierce intent" the narrative claims she possesses.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The character's internal struggle is clear, and the physical grounding during the climax is effective. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("somatic markers," "the body keeps score") to define her state, which creates a clinical distance rather than a purely embodied experience of trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena's motivation is clear but stated rather than embodied ("crestfallen," "bitter"). The epiphany feels unearned, arriving via abstract realization rather than a difficult, character-specific choice that forces a trade-off. The emotion reads as labeled interiority rather than visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is a distinct presence with physical constraints (light sensitivity) that ground the fantasy. The transition from hunter to seeker is motivated, though the link between the ink mandalas and her brother's death feels intuitive rather than strictly earned by on-page evidence. The "consciously wild" trait appears as a descriptive label rather than a driver of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is diagnosed via labels ("bravely conflicted") rather than dramatized through friction or behavior. The presence of the activation core in her pocket is a convenience that bypasses the need for resourcefulness or struggle, reducing her agency to a binary switch-flip rather than a hard-won choice. The sudden realization of the conspiracy ("Within the blink...") feels like an unearned leap in intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    The father's rapid transformation from armed bounty hunter to gardener feels emotionally unearned and convenient for the story's length. Mara's key trait ("senselessly perceptive") is delivered via a label rather than dramatized through unique observation or action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira is a distinct, competent protagonist whose interiority ("drowning on dry land") grounds her mythic task in tangible grief. Her choice to voice "anti-sound" reveals character through specific, risky action rather than just exposition. The emotional stakes are palpable, though her "cool-headed" competence slightly dampens the sense of struggle during the capture.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Adelaide’s internal conflict is sharply drawn, and her motivation to prioritize truth over legacy is earned through the specific "proof by contradiction" intellectual exercise. The transition from detached observer to active participant is credible, and the cost of her decision is felt. The use of "inner chaos" is slightly abstract, but the resulting agency is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.9)
    Character motivation is legible, but the pivotal realization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("transmuted into Mira's lifelong inability to translate emotion...") rather than embodied experience. The confusion regarding the mother's history—the letter claims abandonment ("gave her away") while Mira asserts she was raised ("Mother had kept her")—creates a contradiction in the character's backstory that is not effectively dramatized or resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Isla's motivation is clear, but the pivot to the "mothers and daughters" realization feels unearned by the brief on-page interaction. The reliance on the narrator stating she is "socially perceptive" rather than dramatizing the trait weakens the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vessa’s "gentle radical" nature is not just a label but is physically embodied in her augmentations (hands for sparrow's eggs), grounding her motivation effectively. Her final decision to suppress the truth feels earned by this specific character setup, balancing personal integrity against her established desire to cradle empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Celeste is clearly drawn as a persona, but her internal transition from "hunger for applause" to altruistic savior is convenient rather than earned through pressure. The stakes of her existence are low; she faces no risk of fading or failure, making her choice to perform feel like a low-cost gesture rather than a gripping sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's motivation to heal Iris is clear and drives the narrative, but her emotional journey feels somewhat mechanical due to the brevity. The conflict between her skepticism and her actions is stated ("skepticism felt hollow") rather than dramatized through hesitation or resistance in the moment. The "affection warring with frustration" beat is a label rather than a felt experience on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is clear, but the internal pivot ("Mira had come to understand") relies on summary rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional experience is often filtered through diagnostic labels ("human longing," "fear," "hope") rather than embodied sensation, creating distance during the critical realization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maren lacks agency in the face of the central problem; she resolves the conflict through an "instinct she couldn't name" rather than earned struggle or intellect. Her internal state transitions from resignation to triumph without a dramatized pivot point or moment of doubt. The resolution costs her nothing—no sacrifice, risk, or painful realization is required to unlock the jar.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Character motivation is clear and the internal arc—moving from hiding to action—is legible. However, the pivotal emotional shift is summarized ("Claire felt something uncurl") rather than dramatized through behavior, and the dialogue leans into genre tropes ("I wasn't sure you'd come back") rather than specific, character-revealing interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    The Coachman functions more as a static sage dispensing wisdom than a character with genuine internal friction. The woman's rapid pivot from desperate litigant to philosophical accepter feels convenient and unearned by the brief interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is internally consistent and her specific skillset (observation/pottery) drives the resolution, but she lacks significant internal contradiction or struggle. Her "zen" nature smooths over potential conflict, making her journey feel more like a procedural realization than a character tested by pressure. The choice to stay and tend the oasis lacks a visible, felt cost or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira functions as a mentor archetype rather than a complex protagonist under pressure; her motivation to "stop hiding" is stated rather than dramatized through resistance. The emotional stakes of her past are summarized, and her interaction with the children lacks the friction or unpredictability that reveals deep character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s internal landscape is legible, and the transition from fear to acceptance is coherent. However, the motivation is explicitly told ("translate her isolation into independence") rather than emerging solely from friction, and the emotional arc feels slightly smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated but lacks internal friction; her decision to release the letters feels predetermined rather than forged under pressure. The lack of hesitation or struggle to "let go" flattens the character arc into a smooth, fable-like progression without the grit of genuine reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara is a competent protagonist, but her internal landscape lacks the contradiction or cost required for higher bands. She acts as a functional problem-solver; her "cautiously hopeful" stance is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The victory comes without a personal price or a significant challenge to her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's claustrophobia provides a clear physical constraint, but her interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("wistful rebellion coursed through her veins") rather than embodied emotion. The choice to suppress her fear is present, but the emotional arc feels mechanically asserted rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera’s prosopagnosia is a distinct, well-utilized trait that shapes her perspective ("architecture of gesture"). However, her internal journey lacks a dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses; her motivation is stated ("not justice, but awakening") rather than tested by a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira’s motivation is legible, but Dr. Yoon’s conversion is too rapid; he shifts from hostility to collaboration the moment the prop is revealed, lacking the friction of a true "reversible exile" mindset. The attribute "nervously confident" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maria is a distinct presence, and her motivation to "bear witness" gives the narrative direction. However, the attribute "dynamically observant" is asserted as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult, active struggle to discern the truth. Her acceptance of the impossible ("luminous disbelief") comes too easily, lacking the internal resistance or emotional cost that would make the realization land with deeper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Luka’s introspection relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("transcendence," "predation," "innovation"), resolving complex psychology into tidy abstractions rather than embodied struggle. This overly lucid self-analysis flattens the emotional crisis, as the character acts more like a therapist explaining his own flaws than a person living through them.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character arcs rely on rapid emotional shifts rather than earned development; Kove's 15-year grief resolves instantly ("something unlocking") upon sharing one story. Mira's role as a "lucid dream chronicler" colors the narration but does not mechanically drive her choices or the resolution. The connection feels idealized, lacking the friction or specific interpersonal cost that grounds profound healing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael is an exceptionally drawn protagonist whose central trait ("guarded") creates both her professional strength and the personal obstacle she must overcome ("unbending"). The revelation that the victim blamed "the druid who loved me" recontextualizes Kael's guarded nature as a scar from this past trauma, adding profound depth without exposition. Her internal cost is palpable and drives the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara is defined primarily by backstory and prophetic destiny rather than present-moment agency or struggle. Her internal state is handled through diagnostic labeling ("anxious elation") rather than embodied experience, and the interaction with Chen lacks necessary friction or status negotiation; they agree instantly, leaving the relationship flat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's characterization is strong; the "reckless idealist" trait isn't just a label but the engine of the climax, driving her decision to attempt the impossible "unmaking" despite the known costs. Her internal conflict between pride in her work and the guilt of its consequences is handled with nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary; the protagonist’s past as a roadie informs his sensory perception ("smell of blown speakers") and present worldview ("insulating himself"). Internal conflict between the safety of data and the human need for myth is dramatized through action, leading to a choice that feels earned and specific to his history.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    Character motivation is legible and the internal state is consistent, but the protagonist relies heavily on the static label "kindly methodical," which appears twice verbatim rather than being dramatized through varied action. The emotional arc is smooth and lacks the internal contradiction or grit required for higher bands; Asha’s transition from grief to acceptance feels frictionless and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maren functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character with embodied struggle; her emotional reaction to the world-ending premise is summarized ("Panic had subsided") rather than dramatized. The absence of internal friction or reluctance makes her compliance with the instructions feel automatic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s transformation relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I forgot how to feel") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional pivot is swift and unearned, fueled by reading a journal rather than a dramatized confrontation with her own numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s transition from repression to expression is clear, but her epiphany relies on diagnostic interiority ("The truth was...") rather than dramatized realization. The moment she perfectly psychoanalyzes her own motives ("attempt to reconstruct what she'd destroyed") feels like authorial explanation, reducing the emotional authenticity of the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s motivation to find the library of unspoken words is compelling and drives every action. The choice to document her findings to close the causal loop demonstrates strong agency and acceptance of the cost (the burden of silence). The "Incident" serves as a functional but slightly convenient backstory shortcut, though it adds distinct flavor to her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iris is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict (preservation vs. possession) drives the narrative. Her agency is high; she actively seeks information via the coffee stains and makes a decisive, high-cost choice at the end. The integration of multiple psychic abilities (psychometry, precognition, plant telepathy) is managed well, using the ferns to reinforce the thematic pivot toward propagation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael acts as a competent procedural vessel rather than a character under pressure; she encounters no resistance, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no personal price. The required trait "lucidly watchful" appears as an inserted label rather than a constraint that shapes a decision or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mei is distinct and consistent, but the decision to locate her primary struggle (forgiveness) in the distant past renders her static in the present scene. The prompt trait "kindly decisive" is enacted, but it lowers the stakes of the encounter, making her reaction feel inevitable rather than earned in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Keegan's internal shift is legible, and Mara's agency drives the encounter. However, the emotional climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("protected vulnerability, raw and real") rather than embodied reaction, which flattens the pivotal moment of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Keiran's backwards aging is a compelling, specific trait that mirrors the theme of "unbecoming" effectively. Maia's motivation relies on summarized backstory ("family's scandal") rather than on-page pressure, making her internal state feel slightly abstract until the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist is a static, god-like entity who faces no internal contradiction or risk. Her agency is limited to waiting and bestowing wisdom without personal cost or struggle, resulting in a character who functions more as a plot device than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.3)
    Teryn is a clearly defined, consistent protagonist, but she remains static; she begins the story certain of her values and ends vindicated without facing a moment of genuine internal doubt or costly renunciation. Her struggle is purely external and physical, lacking the contradictory impulses or moral complexity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is a compelling protagonist with a specific, constrained gift (fragmentary synesthesia) that justifies his motivation. The internal conflict between scientific obsession (solving the code) and grief is resolved through a credible shift in perspective. The emotional logic holds, though the ease with which he accepts the mystery at the end feels slightly hurried given his prior obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Internal conflict is identified via labels ("stellar doubt," "quietly enthusiastic") rather than dramatized through contradictory choices or hesitation on the page. The protagonist faces no genuine emotional friction; she performs her ritual and receives immediate validation, leaving her motivation functional but static. The "decision maker" aspect is handled as a mechanical process rather than a test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s internal paralysis is beautifully rendered, and the transition from hollow grief to active naming is earned through the specific pressure of the recordings. Her choice to confront the pain rather than suppress it carries visible emotional cost ("painful but present"). The characterization avoids stock brooding by anchoring her struggle in the specific incapacity to perform her office (reaping).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren's "lukewarm" definition is brilliantly integrated into the resolution, turning a perceived flaw into the specific key for success. The "cost" of her success—eternal vigilance timing the drips—creates a solid Resonant Reconfiguration, though her "brittle" devotion is more stated in exposition than tested by temptation or failure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is a coherent protagonist with clear agency in the final decision. However, her motivation ("to spin stories into shared meaning") feels expository and slightly meta rather than fully embodied in the scene's action. The connection to the grandfather provides context but feels functionally inserted to justify the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist is clearly defined, but key traits are delivered via exposition ("She was secretly sentimental") rather than dramatized action. The internal conflict resolves too smoothly; her rigid discipline crumbles instantly upon seeing the starlings, lacking the struggle or resistance that characterizes deep motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera is a functional protagonist with clear motivation and a distinct internal conflict (escape vs. duty). However, the pivot from near-suicidal escapism to benevolent educator feels precipitous and relies on a competence-porn trope (the expert trance) rather than a difficult, high-cost personal choice. The interiority is consistent but leans slightly into melodramatic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kenji’s internal arc from numbness to connection is legible and central, driven by the specific catalyst of the "duplicate" brain. However, the climax relies heavily on reported emotion ("felt his voice shake," "sensation was overwhelming") rather than fully embodied experience, which creates a slight distance in the pivotal moment. The shift from detachment to brotherhood is earned conceptually but happens rapidly for the depth of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Miranda functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; her trait of being "receptive to signs" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through complex choice. Her emotional reaction to the mentor's revelation is summarized, which flattens the potential for genuine interiority or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marcus creates a clear focal point, but his interiority relies heavily on summarized labels ("mournfully eager") rather than dramatized struggle. He faces no internal resistance or conflicting impulses during the ritual, making him a static agent of the plot rather than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s feral physicality is effectively embodied in movement ("more fox than human") and perception, grounding the abstract premise. The internal transition from feral creature to guardian is earned through specific actions and the resonant realization at the climax. The cost of her transformation—becoming a "boundary" creature—is clearly felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren’s motivation is clearly defined, and her internal conflict between the safety of the Royal Metallurgist destiny and the risk of the Great Work drives the narrative. The transition from hopelessness to agency is handled well through the recontextualization of her failures, though the epiphany moment feels slightly accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is competent and unified in purpose, but lacks the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. Her journey is a smooth realization of a philosophical stance rather than a struggle against conflicting needs. The choice to stay is backstory; in-scene, she faces no distinct trade-off or difficult emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus is clearly motivated and competent, but he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His "resilient positivity" functions as a superpower that facilitates a smooth victory rather than a trait that costs him something or forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marina's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her "calm and methodical" competence under pressure flattens the emotional stakes, making her a vehicle for the process rather than a character making difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Yael is a distinct, competent protagonist whose internal conflict—rigor vs. wonder—drives the narrative. Her decision to leave for the surface demonstrates clear agency and cost (exile from home), though Reeves functions primarily as a sounding board rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara functions as a plot device rather than a character with genuine interiority or internal conflict. Her motivation ("protect vulnerable voices") and attribute ("persistently curious") are stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices or costs. There is no friction between her wants and her actions; she faces no doubts or personal stakes in the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation—witnessing the erased—is compelling and anchors the narrative effectively. However, the claustrophobia feels slightly diagnostic ("a contradiction she'd lived with") rather than purely embodied, and her reaction to the eldritch "singing" remains procedural rather than visceral, dampening the psychological stakes of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marcus's internal conflict between rigid control (counting) and the desire for integration is well-dramatized. However, the internal monologue occasionally drifts into diagnostic labels ("defragment himself," "talismans of endings") rather than embodied experience, making the realization feel slightly processed rather than discovered in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maerith’s obsession is compelling, and her motivation to preserve the language drives the narrative effectively. However, the emotional cost ("sanity") is summarized by the narrator rather than dramatized in the present action. The backstory of her family provides context but feels somewhat detached from her current, highly technical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s internal conflict between her scientific guise and personal grief is compelling. The pivot from skeptic to believer is sharp but anchored by the visceral intervention of her mother’s voice. However, the backstory justification ("DNA report") feels slightly utilitarian given the mystical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira functions as a competent archetype rather than a flawed individual; she faces no internal contradictions and overcomes the external obstacle without hesitation or error. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("to reawaken beauty") rather than revealed through difficult choices, and she pays no personal price for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael is a consistent, competent focalizer whose internal landscape matches the story's weary tone. However, he remains largely static; his choices (hiding from drones, delivering the package) are routine rather than character-defining under pressure. The emotional weight is carried more by the secondary character's report than by Kael's immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s internal state is rendered with sensory clarity, but the emotional arc lacks friction; the transition from seven years of trauma-induced silence to singing feels frictionless and unearned by struggle on the page. The healing process reads as inevitable rather than fought for, making the characterization feel slightly thin despite the specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    Meridian functions as a competent observer and concept-delivery vehicle rather than a dynamic protagonist under pressure. While her backstory (grandmother) provides context, her internal state lacks contradiction or high-stakes desire; the realization comes easily without a costly choice or significant struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marina's internal state of grief is consistent, but the emotional arc relies on a convenient external discovery (the note) rather than a hard internal choice. The transition from longing to understanding is smoothed over by this deus ex machina, bypassing the need for a costly renunciation or change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is legible, but Mara functions more as a thematic vessel than a vivid individual; her fear is summarized rather than dramatized in behavior before the climax. The locksmith is a functional archetype who explains Mara's internal state to her, robbing the scene of subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is a competent, proactive protagonist, but her primary trait ("chronically curious") is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through difficult micro-choices. The internal conflict—fear vs. curiosity—is resolved somewhat easily, and her emotional state remains relatively stable throughout the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    Miren is a distinct focalizer with a clear voice, but Kael functions more as a prop for the lesson than a fully realized agent. Her transformation from defiant to resilient occurs primarily within a summary montage ("across dozens of cups"), which elides the internal struggle and makes the emotional shift feel unearned by immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    Esme is an archetype rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a difficult choice. Her "insatiable creativity" is asserted as a label rather than demonstrated through a unique, high-stakes tactical decision. The lack of interior conflict turns her into a functional vessel for the magic system rather than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s internal landscape is expertly mapped through somatic details ("trembling hands") that link her backstory failure to her current mastery. The choice to prioritize truth over peace demonstrates complex agency, and the accumulated "silence" serves as a palpable, character-specific cost that deepens with the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena is a distinct, competent professional whose "methodical curiosity" logically drives the investigation, avoiding the passive observer trap. However, she lacks significant internal conflict or personal stakes; her journey is purely intellectual, and the absence of a visceral cost or contradictory impulse limits the character's depth beyond her functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina is a compelling focalizer whose "first-name basis with death" informs her calm agency under pressure. The shift from an active desire to solve the mystery to a resigned "witnessing" is a well-earned psychological turn rooted in the scene's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is defined more by archetype ("seldom-heard musician") than by behavior under pressure; she faces no internal contradiction or hard choice. Motivation is clear, but her progression is a straight line of competence without the friction of doubt, sacrifice, or error that characterizes high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s interiority is distinct, blending duty with a specific "warm inquisitiveness." The shift from grief to "affectionate detachment" is earned through the accumulation of memories, though the final emotional state is slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a compelling focalizer whose grief is distinctly filtered through her scientific expertise ("Grief... followed by coordinates"). Her internal conviction contrasts sharply with the implied external judgment of her colleagues, creating a rich, embodied interiority. The transition from mourning to professional resolve is earned through specific observations.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist's prosopagnosia is not just a trait but the lens through which she perceives the world, creating a distinct and consistent internal experience. Her connection to the coin through her own artistic limitations is poignant. However, her interaction with the custodian's body is passive; we miss the beat where she applies her "measuring" gaze to him, which softens the setup for the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren is a competent, proactive protagonist with a clear motivation ("chart phenomena"), but her internal life lacks friction. The "sociable isolation" trait is stated but not tested by the events; she faces no internal conflict or significant character-level cost in solving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Internal conflict is summarized via diagnostic labels ("hollow") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The pivotal transition relies on an unearned "suddenly she understood" epiphany rather than an active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mirela functions more as a benevolent plot device than a complex character; her motivation is clear but static, lacking internal contradiction or difficult choices beyond the physical toll of her manifestation. Kess serves primarily as a reactive mouthpiece for the theme rather than a fully realized agent. The emotional arc is serviceable but lacks the specific, embodied interiority required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s motivation is poignant and clearly established, rooting the surreal premise in human grief. However, her internal state is somewhat static; the decision to act feels pre-determined rather than forged under immediate on-page pressure or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren's internal conflict between resentment and conscience is established early and drives the narrative arc. The shift from prisoner to purposeful guardian is earned through the on-page action of the rescue, creating a satisfying emotional pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s internal landscape is legible, and the "symphonic" trait integrates well with her perception of the ravine. However, her emotional pivot from eighteen months of blocked grief to sudden clarity feels rapid and slightly convenient ("pieces began falling into place"), relying on a standard epiphany structure rather than a hard-won internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is a competent, consistent focalizer with a clear professional objective, but she lacks the internal contradiction or struggle required for higher bands. Her journey is procedural—she enters, performs a task without significant obstacles or difficult choices, and leaves. The narrative lacks a "crucible" moment where her values are tested against a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren is a distinct, high-concept protagonist whose chef background perfectly colors her interiority ("palate like copper," "complex char"). Her competence is established and enacted, though her victory over the antagonistic memories relies more on existing discipline than a new, high-cost decision in the moment. The "brittle heart" suggests internal toll, creating a solid emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is a proactive protagonist who drives the plot, but her characterization relies heavily on stated attributes ("empathetically decisive") rather than dramatized internal struggle. Her success comes without significant personal cost or difficult trade-offs, making her feel more like a plot device than a complex agent.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya creates a functional focal point, but her complexity relies on exposition ("helix-minded," "difficult person to understand") rather than dramatized behavior. Her internal conflict is resolved via a convenient realization rather than a struggle between incompatible needs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Celene is a distinct, competent lead whose &quot;prism-minded&quot; nature actively drives the resolution. However, her journey lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; she executes a plan without a moment of doubt, hesitation, or personal cost that would deepen the characterization beyond professional capability.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara is competent and driven, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she proceeds from desire to success without significant doubt or hard choices. The reliance on "fingers bleeding" to signal effort is a cliché that substitutes for deeper psychological or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    Katrin is a coherent, sympathetic protagonist with a clear backstory and motivation grounded in the text. However, her internal landscape is static; she faces no genuine dilemma or high-stakes trade-off, relying instead on a pre-existing skill set that functions without generating character-defining friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcella’s internal landscape is rich, successfully dramatizing the abstract concept of "frequencies of silence" into character motivation. The contrast between her "gentle non-confrontation" and her sister's resilience "forged in fire" provides a strong, earned deepening of character. The emotional progression feels slightly linear—solving a puzzle sequence rather than forcing a painful tradeoff—but the realization at the end is character-specific and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lirien's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but her internal struggle is summarized rather than dramatized. We are told of her transformation and endurance ("she remained, breathing shallowly") rather than witnessing the specific micro-choices and immediate reactions that would earn that change in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael is competent and motivated, but her "intrepid" nature is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through complex choices. She follows instructions from the echo rather than deducing the solution, which limits agency.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara functions primarily as a camera for the setting rather than a character under pressure; she observes and deduces without facing significant internal contradiction or personal risk. Her motivation (father's legacy) feels grafted on rather than a source of difficult choices, and her "rapid adaptation" is stated as a competency rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is a consistent, competent protagonist whose synesthesia adds genuine texture to his perspective. However, his journey is largely procedural; he executes a plan without significant internal doubt or a dilemma that forces a difficult trade-off, limiting the depth of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s internal arc is expertly drawn, moving from the "hoarded" weight of guilt to a verified understanding of entropy. The shift from guardian to witness is earned through on-page action, with the cost being the acceptance that the loss is permanent and unfixable. Her motivation—to find the "hairline fracture"—propels every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is compelling, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I borrow personalities because I suspect mine is incomplete") rather than embodied struggle. The sudden, articulate self-analysis in the climax deflates the tension of the "uncalculated" fear.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kessa's internal conflict between anxiety and the weight of legacy is well-drawn, with her trembling hands serving as a consistent physical anchor for her state. The micro-choice to stop for the farmer, overriding her instinct to rush, effectively dramatizes her growth. The shift from nervousness to steady purpose is earned through the encounters, though the realization at the end feels slightly smoothed by the herbalist's explicit validation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s internal pivot from skepticism to belief is clear and motivated by grief, though the transition feels somewhat rapid for the stated seventeen-year habit of skepticism. The emotional cost of abandoning her "carefully constructed understanding" is stated more than dramatized in the moment of change, but her drive to honor the mentor anchors the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype of maternal sacrifice rather than a fully realized character; her interiority is summarized through labels ("despair," "wistful") rather than embodied struggle. While her motivation is clear, the lack of contradictory impulses or hesitation makes her sacrifice feel mechanical rather than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is a clearly drawn archetype whose stoicism anchors the piece, and the physicalization of memory loss creates genuine pathos. However, his internal landscape lacks active conflict; he is "never uncertain," which removes the tension of choice from the scene—he is executing a decision made prior to the narrative window rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaia’s internal landscape is rich, and her sensory-synesthetic perspective is established with strong particularity. The mother’s motivation (decades of abandonment for "protection" due to illegality) feels slightly convenient and expository, resolving the central emotional wound too tidily for the established stakes. Kaia’s acceptance of this explanation is swift, missing a beat of conflict or anger that would deepen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("Safety. Pure and absolute") rather than embodied emotion or specific memory. The choreography with the sea glass—placing it as the peak of a monument and then immediately pocketing it—creates a confusing contradiction in her physical agency and intent. Her connection to the "mother's arms" feels inserted as a summary explanation rather than arising organically from the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.7)
    Mara is competent but static; she faces no internal friction or genuine doubt. Her defining trait (laughter) feels performative rather than driven by character depth, and her "prophetic" nature is asserted by the narrator rather than demonstrated through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is passive, serving primarily as a receptacle for the proprietor's exposition. Her central motivation (understanding the magnetism) is resolved by being told the answer rather than through active discovery or struggle. The logic of her behavior contradicts the timeline; she attributes her habits to the heart, yet the text states the wing has been her teacher for thirty years (predating the surgery).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is a capable focalizer, but her pivotal realization ("She understood then what needed doing") arrives instantly without internal struggle or debate. The magical healing of the thumb acts as immediate proof-of-concept, lowering the stakes of her decision to deconstruct the instrument since success feels guaranteed before the risk is taken.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s fragmentation is a compelling internal state that mirrors the setting, establishing a strong unity of character and world. However, her interiority remains somewhat distant and mythic; the pivotal choice to dissolve feels like an inevitable archetype rather than a wrestled-with decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's defining traits are established through labels ("compassionate recluse," "empathetic nature") rather than dramatized action. Her central realization is unearned, occurring passively as she reads an expository passage in a book rather than emerging from interpersonal struggle or high-stakes choice. The empathy is claimed in backstory but functions in-scene only as a convenient radar to sense safety, lacking cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s internal conflict—her sense of complicity in the erasure—adds necessary weight to the "noticer" archetype, grounding her agency in guilt rather than just observation. The shift from guerrilla gardener to archivist of memory feels earned, though the realization is sparked somewhat passively by the ghostly encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Celeste is a tightly drawn protagonist whose shift from preservation to transformation drives the narrative arc. Her internal acceptance of the library's fall, balanced against the competence of her final act, creates a poignant, earned agency. The cost—her life for the slide's survival—is deeply felt in her final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Della’s motivation is visceral and clearly established, driving the action with precision. The shift from vengeance to mercy is earned through the mirror-image motivation of the antagonist (a father saving his daughter), creating a satisfying psychological resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaia’s skepticism functions more as a declared label than a resistance mechanism; she capitulates to the mystical explanation via internal monologue without genuine struggle or tactical oscillation. The "glow" provides nice physical irony, but the emotional pivot to "luminous acceptance" feels smooth and inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is largely passive, defined by labels ("mnemonically gifted") rather than active traits in the scene. Her emotional arc is resolved by an external benefactor who appears to fix the central problem, denying Maya the agency to make a difficult choice with visible cost. The internal conflict is articulated but not dramatized through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira's hybrid physiology is evocative but functions primarily as a convenient lie-detector rather than a source of complex internal conflict. Kade's transformation from cynic to ally occurs too abruptly to feel earned, lacking the necessary friction or dramatized processing to make the relational pivot credible.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.4)
    Mara functions as a ritual practitioner rather than a character with agency or internal conflict; she executes a plan without facing a difficult choice or deviation. The "seasonally mute" trait, while mentioned, loses functional impact in a world where speech is already obsolete, failing to constrain her or distinguish her experience. The narrative relies on her competence without testing it against failure or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Unit-47’s motivation is grounded in a clear conflict between function and sentiment. The decision to burn the cherished box of fears creates a distinct, character-driven beat with a visible emotional cost, effectively demonstrating the android's values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya functions more as a benevolent plot device than a vivid protagonist; she faces no internal resistance, overcomes no personal flaw, and pays no price for her success. The emotional arc relies on "therapy-speak" labels ("grief needed witnesses") rather than dramatized struggle, resulting in a "white knight" dynamic that lacks authentic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mira is a compelling concept but lacks dramatic friction; her victory is pre-calculated "weeks ago," leaving no room for doubt, error, or difficult choice in the present moment. The characterization relies on high competence without a counterbalance of struggle or vulnerability in the scene, making the emotional arc feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren is a compelling focalizer whose transition from passive observer to active "exhumer" is deeply rooted in the specific backstory of her grandmother's dementia. Her internal landscape is rich and contradictory (grief vs. scientific curiosity), and the choice to dedicate her life to the chamber carries a palpable, lonely cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    The summoner is a competent, consistent protagonist who executes her task with professional detachment. However, she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is linear and faces no significant emotional or moral challenge that tests her resolve, resulting in a functional but static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dr. Khoury is a compelling, if archetypal, figure. The narrator serves primarily as a vessel for the mystery, lacking distinct internal friction; their skepticism dissolves too conveniently into wonder without sufficient resistance or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara acts with agency, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract thematic labeling ("translate her isolation into independence") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulse. The transition from skeptic to leader feels frictionless; the stakes of using her sister's memory are asserted but not felt as a difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lien is a competent professional with clear motivation ("complete what he began"), but the central agonizing choice—to commit treason—occurred in backstory weeks ago. The on-page narrative focuses on the execution of a settled decision rather than active struggle or risk, reducing the "crucible" effect of the scene. Interiority is solid, though the realization at the end feels slightly explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael functions primarily as a camera for the world-building rather than an agent with deep internal contradiction. Her transition from courier to guardian lacks a difficult choice or sacrifice; she simply accepts the new role, making the emotional arc feel linear and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya functions as a competent investigator, but her internal life is static; the central realization is an intuitive leap rather than a choice forged in pressure, leaving her devoid of conflicting impulses or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Chen is a distinct, realized presence with a cohesive worldview connecting her labor to her philosophy. Her interiority is specific and avoids stock phrasing, though she remains largely static in this scene; the "crucible" of the moment is intellectual rather than emotional, limiting the visceral cost of her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.6)
    Maya is defined primarily by her "debunker" label, and her pivot from truth-seeker to secret-keeper feels rushed due to the story's compression. Her competence relies heavily on "intuiting" answers rather than demonstrated deduction, which flattens the intellectual struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    Vera is a passive vessel who observes rather than acts; her internal shifts are summarized ("She no longer felt lonely") rather than earned through dramatized struggle. She lacks immediate agency, and her primary motivation is stated in exposition rather than tested by a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear backstory, but her pivotal realization relies on diagnostic interiority ("her true motivation finally crystallizing") rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's duality as an engineer and emotional conduit is well-established, grounding the magical realism in character competence. Kael functions effectively as a foil, though his dialogue leans slightly into melodramatic villain archetypes ("Isn't absolution worth the cost?"). Maren's internal conflict and professional history provide a solid foundation for her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael is competent and distinct, but her primary motivation ("sculpting patience") is delivered via exposition rather than dramatized through a difficult choice in the moment. The character operates without internal contradiction or immediate pressure; she executes a pre-formulated plan flawlessly, which limits emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sara is a competent, proactive protagonist whose motivation is clear. However, her interiority relies heavily on "entangled memories" that feel more like a prompt insertion than an organic psychological state, blurring the line between intuition and supernatural insight without earning it. The transition from shaking hands to "unshakeable case" is swift and lacks sufficient internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus creates a clear focal point, but his internal struggle is resolved through conversation rather than a high-stakes choice under pressure. Mrs. Chen functions largely as a plot device to facilitate the resolution, and the dialogue leans into diagnostic label-speak ("an apology is just air") that flattens character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fennec's voice—"Ridiculous," "Absolutely idiotic"—creates a distinct interiority that contrasts effectively with the story's high-concept scope. Her history as a cart glider is well-integrated as a metaphor for her current work ("cartographer of want"), though the scene lacks a high-pressure choice to force a deeper revelation of character beyond her established dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira is a compelling protagonist whose transition from professional curiosity to high-stakes rescuer is grounded in a well-placed personal connection (the brother). Her interiority is rendered with specific, job-relevant details ("digital exhaust," "null-state"), and her agency drives every turn of the plot. The shift from observer to active agent is earned and carries visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael functions as a static archetype of wisdom rather than a character under pressure; she experiences no internal conflict, doubt, or cost while resolving the dispute. Her "calmly intuitive" nature removes the struggle from the negotiation, turning her into a plot device rather than a protagonist with agency and flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera’s internal landscape is compelling, blending the clinical detachment of a "euthanasia tourist" with a newfound, fragile capacity for connection. The shift from "gripping tightly" to "loosened" reality is well-articulated, though the initial transformation via waking up feels slightly expository rather than dramatized. The grandmother's observation serves as a potent external validation of her internal state, effectively deepening the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marco's motivation is clear, but the dialogue suffers significantly from "diagnostic label-speak" (e.g., "intersubjective understanding") that breaks naturalism and character voice. The emotional connection feels asserted through these labels rather than purely dramatized through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but her "strangely honest" trait is delivered via narrator summary rather than dramatized friction. Her acceptance of the sacrifice is immediate and unwavering; the lack of internal struggle or visceral hesitation flattens the emotional cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.4)
    Characters function primarily as thematic vehicles without internal contradiction or struggle; emotions are calibrated perfectly for the plot (instant acceptance) rather than embodied with human messy resistance. Thomas's dialogue ("It's everyone's pain") reads as diagnostic label-speak, flattening his interiority into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("recognized as weathered innocence," "something between fear and wonder") rather than embodied emotion. The "reticent scholar" archetype holds firm, though the emotional struggle feels somewhat summarized rather than dramatized under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The relationship between Marcus and Sarah is tender, but the dialogue feels overly stylized and prophetic ("Clinging to echoes—that's all prophecy is"), making them sound more like thematic vehicles than living people. Sarah's motivations are clear, but the "junkyard prophet" persona leans heavily on the label rather than demonstrated behavior beyond the initial description.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira is a compelling protagonist with distinct competence; her transition from camera repair to clockwork grounds her expertise. Her motivation—to understand the mechanism's behavior rather than merely force compliance—is clear and drives the scene. The "grandmother's method" adds texture but teeters on the edge of the "magical wise elder" trope.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    Maya functions as a "magical helper" archetype rather than a character; she lacks internal conflict, contradiction, or personal stakes. Richard is a standard stock figure defined solely by his regret, and Linda serves merely as a plot lever who resolves the central conflict instantly upon arrival. The characterization relies on idealized labels ("decisively kind") rather than dramatized complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s "quietly deliberate" trait moves beyond a label to dictate her response to existential terror, grounding her choice to study rather than flee. The internal conflict between the scholar and the shadow-self is dramatized through action, earning the final moment of Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren is drawn with a consistent voice, and her transition from skeptic to believer is the story's core arc. However, the shift happens rapidly ("cracking open like an egg") with minimal resistance or internal struggle, making the "skeptic" trait feel more like a label than a genuine obstacle. The "forgiving" aspect of her characterization is under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s internal state is clearly defined, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("transform them through this patient practice") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional arc feels therapeutic and tidy, lacking the messy contradiction or raw edges that characterize deep characterization under pressure. Her psychology is explained to the reader more than it is dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is well-rendered, and her motivation to transform trauma into growth is distinct and consistent. The choice to offer the pendant is a strong character beat that earns the emotional shift, though the woman’s rapid acceptance of the lesson feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s grief and creative paralysis are deeply felt and embodied, providing strong internal motivation. However, the secondary character functions primarily as a thematic delivery device rather than a fully realized individual, making the interaction feel convenient rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maera is a consistent protagonist, and her "tinkerer" nature is cleverly applied to the ritual (tuning the vines), but her internal landscape lacks contradiction. The emotional arc is linear—intent, action, satisfaction—without the friction or self-doubt that characterizes high-band character work.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the ritualistic procedure with palpable emotional weight. Interiority is embodied well through the trembling hands and the "patience made physical," though the specific scientific realization about the neutron star feels slightly more diagnostic than earned by the character's immediate emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is competent and observant, but her journey lacks internal conflict or a "crucible" moment; she solves the puzzle without facing contradictory impulses or significant emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist's internal voice is consistent and fits the mythic tone, and the shift from collector to witness offers a valid internal arc. However, the agency remains largely contemplative; the final decision is a resignation to the premise (Earned Stasis) rather than a high-stakes choice forged in immediate, palpable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Characterization is grounded in specific, lived history (circus details, lions), giving Mira a distinct worldview. The "hauntingly practical" trait effectively drives her unique method of grieving, though the emotional resolution feels slightly smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kera’s internal struggle is vivid, and the externalization of her past self creates a functional "relationship as crucible." The motivation to reclaim agency is consistent, and the shift from avoidance to engagement is earned by the interaction with the object.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maya reads as a competence archetype rather than a character under pressure; she encounters no genuine internal or external resistance. The "stoic wonder" and "functional creativity" are asserted labels rather than traits revealed through difficult choices. Without a moment of potential failure or a cost paid for her success, she lacks dramatic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren's internal landscape is legible, and the shift from avoidance to acceptance is coherent. However, the internal conflict feels slightly standard, and the "obsessive care" of her profession is stated rather than dramatized in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is a distinct archetype with a clear internal shift, but his competence relies too heavily on "prescient instincts" rather than demonstrated skill. The pivotal realization about Dessen's daughter feels like an unearned knowledge leap, reducing the character's agency in solving the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren is defined primarily by her profession and the assigned trait ("patient") rather than through internal conflict or high-stakes choices. She functions as a competent vessel for the premise, lacking contradictory impulses or a moment of genuine doubt that would deepen her characterization beyond the archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina is a compelling vessel for the premise, but she functions more as a thematic catalyst than a struggling protagonist; her wisdom feels pre-packaged rather than earned in the moment. Thomas provides necessary grounding, but the dynamic lacks the friction of genuine conflict, resolving through her guidance rather than mutual struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prince is a sharply defined focalizer with clear, driving motivation. The internal conflict between his mechanical reality and biological ambition is well-dramatized. However, the emotional peak relies on slightly stock gestures ("he wept then") rather than specific, embodied distress, and the father's presence is too brief to generate high-pressure status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    Maya is consistent but idealized, presented as "legendary" rather than complex; her "unyielding compassion" feels static. Marcus functions largely as a prompt-device ("Why do we do this?") to elicit thematic exposition rather than acting as a fully realized agent with resistance. The interaction lacks the friction of genuine character conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara is consistent and the &quot;luminous skeptic&quot; persona is established early, but her internal landscape is relatively static. Her primary trait (skepticism) doesn't create significant friction with her actions; she follows the trail and solves the puzzle with a convenient &quot;gift&quot; rather than a hard-won character turn. The renunciation of her glow at the end is a nice beat of closure, but feels more like a relief than a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's specific trait ("otherworldly sentimentalist") drives the central conflict between the cold data of the gear and the decision to persist. The internal struggle is well-dramatized, redefining "hope" as a "peculiar grief" to earn the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elena serves primarily as a passive vessel for instruction rather than an active agent; she encounters no resistance and makes no difficult choices under pressure. The mentorship is accepted without skepticism or internal conflict, resulting in a protagonist who observes rather than acts. The emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized through embodied reaction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s dedication is clear, and the ritual provides a strong framework for her internal state. However, the scene relies on established duty rather than an active struggle or a new, high-stakes choice on the page; her competence is unchallenged, resulting in a static character arc ("Earned Stasis") rather than dramatic progression.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a competent, active protagonist who drives the investigation, but her internal life lacks friction or contradiction. The transition from professional curiosity to profound emotional understanding feels summarized rather than embodied, particularly in the reaction to the letters. Her "blithe" nature is stated but not deeply tested by the gloom or the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maren is a competent professional who faces no internal opposition or character-specific cost. She functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a protagonist; she executes the task without doubt ("the quill never faltered") or contradictory impulses, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s dedication is consistent and her agency drives the encoding process, but she lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses; she operates as a steadfast vessel for the theme rather than a character torn by difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—publicly performing destruction while secretly preserving—creates deep, embodied conflict that sustains the narrative. The decision to lie to Cassius ("Yes" to scattering) is a poignant, character-defining micro-choice that prioritizes his peace over his philosophy, revealing a complex hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcellus is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear worldview ("rationally rebellious"). His motivation to preserve method over myth is well-established. However, the specific emotional action of "agonizing" is summarized rather than dramatized; his internal state reads more as settled conviction than active struggle, lowering the immediate stakes of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira functions as an archetype of the "wise teacher" rather than a complex protagonist; her "internal borders" and "resignation" are labeled in exposition but not tested by a difficult on-page choice. The students remain generalized sketches (the refugee, the farmer's son) serving the theme rather than generating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara is a competent, idealized protagonist who faces no internal contradiction or genuine doubt. While the "tasting memories" trait is well-integrated, she undergoes no emotional arc or significant cost; she arrives, succeeds, and leaves. The lack of a flaw or difficult choice flattens the character into a functional vehicle for the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mira functions primarily as a courier for the antagonist's solution rather than an active protagonist; she faces no internal conflict or significant external opposition. Her inability to lie is a thematic ornament that colors dialogue but does not force a difficult choice or exact a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya serves as a competent observer, but her primary action—placing the root—relies on a serendipitous find rather than a difficult choice or character-specific struggle. The internal realization feels asserted through exposition ("Maya realized") rather than earned through emotional or physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s motivation is clear, but the woman’s emotional arc resolves too neatly. Her transition from multigenerational anguish to total acceptance happens in a single beat ("understanding finally displacing certainty") without sufficient on-page struggle. The "incisively kind" telepathy feels more informative than relational, reducing the conflict to a data transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s motivation—redeeming a missed opportunity through intellectual conquest—is sharply drawn and sustains the narrative arc. The shift from "methodical purpose" to the "grim optimist" at the end feels earned by the crushing realization in the middle. The backstory regarding the Institute is functional but feels slightly expository compared to the immediate pressure of the staircase.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    Character motivation is legible, but the protagonist’s agency is undermined by the magical brush, which performs the critical work ("moved almost independently"). The conflict is largely internal and resolved by the tool rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Celeste is drawn with precision; her "practiced warmth" serves as a compelling armor that cracks credibly under the violinist's grief. The transition from professional detachment to vulnerability is swift but earned by the internal focus on "rosewater dread." A longer word count might have allowed for more resistance before the shift, but the characterization remains sharp and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    Silas has a clear, albeit archetype-heavy, drive that fits the prompt. However, his competence is convenient; he translates a pre-ancient language and masters alien physics instantly, removing the struggle required to earn the "unmaking" at the end. The emotional reaction ("bleak exhilaration") is labeled rather than embodied through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera functions primarily as a recipient of instruction rather than an active agent; she asks "What do I do?" and executes the advisor's command without independent struggle or synthesis. While her internal fear is rendered with specific imagery, her passivity in the central turning point undermines the dramatic weight of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is a competent focalizer with a clear role, but she lacks internal contradiction or deep emotional friction. Her motivation is functional and stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs; she operates as a professional solving a problem without significant character growth or high-stakes personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is a competent, functional protagonist who drives the plot but lacks internal friction or conflicting impulses. Her motivation is clear ("quietly driven"), but she faces no significant emotional or character-based obstacles; she unlocks doors and reads codes without a "crucible" moment that tests her values or forces a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Helena’s motivation is clear and drives the closure choice, but the characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("emotionally rational by nature") rather than purely dramatized behavior. The internal conflict is resolved efficiently, but the connection to the specific monk feels slightly convenient for the character's backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Garrett is consistently drawn with a clear backstory and motivation, but his internal state is static. He enters the scene with a resolved philosophy ("understood his true calling" a year ago) rather than grappling with a live decision, resulting in a ritualistic enactment rather than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus is a consistent protagonist whose professional traits (indexing, methodical patience) drive the action. His motivation to uncover the truth is clear and links to his grandmother’s backstory without overwhelming the present scene. The attribute "tranquilly perceptive" feels slightly inserted as a label rather than purely demonstrated, but his behavior under pressure aligns with the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, and her internal landscape is vivid. However, the shift to summary ("Night after night") dilutes her struggle into a generalized process, distancing the reader from the specific, embodied cost of her choices in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amal’s internal landscape is stark and compelling; the split between her "dead" rational mind and her grief-driven purpose creates a powerful engine for the narrative. The physical embodiment of her trauma (scarred hands, pressing against the geode) grounds the high-concept premise in visceral reality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara is a clearly defined archetype with intelligible motivation, but her emotional arc feels rushed, jumping from weariness to tearful epiphany in a single beat. The shared descriptor "perpetually surprised" applied to both characters blurs their distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s internal conflict is drawn with precision, moving from professional justification to a sophisticated moral realization. The shift in her understanding of Iris's motive—from protecting Clara from cruelty to protecting her from the burden of forgiveness—provides a profound, character-specific pivot that earns the final confession.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is a distinct, active protagonist whose professional competence and subversive empathy drive the plot. Her choice to reveal the drawer pull serves as a credible catalyst for the shift in dynamic, grounded in established motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina’s internal state is well-defined, but her critical flaw (freezing at crucial moments) is established in backstory rather than tested on the page. The transition from regret to action feels smoothed over by the arrival of the text message, which resolves her hesitation instantly rather than forcing a dramatized struggle against her nature.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maya’s motivation—the "void" where her conscience should be—is compelling, but her "trafficker" past is purely backstory that doesn't pressure her choices in the present moment beyond the initial setup. She acts primarily as a recipient of information rather than an active agent struggling against resistance; the resolution involves her accepting a destiny handed to her by a future figure rather than forging it through difficult on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clearly established, and her interiority is accessible. However, the central reluctance—her resistance to change—is slightly undercut by her methodical preparation (bringing the vials), making the hesitation feel more procedural than a visceral struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nadia’s interiority is grounded in a specific, embodied guilt that drives the narrative arc. The conflict between professional identity and motherhood is dramatized effectively through the ritual, though the trait "willingly perplexed" reads more as backstory exposition than an active driver of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ren is a consistent focalizer with a clear internal arc (cowardice to action). However, the interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("shadow work," "cowardice") rather than purely dramatized struggle, which distances the reader slightly from the visceral experience of the character's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maris lacks active agency; her primary action (releasing bugs) is dictated by a prophecy she merely stumbles into, rendering her a vessel for the plot rather than a driver. The emotional realization is summarized in the final paragraph through internal monologue rather than dramatized via a difficult, high-stakes choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira is competent and consistent, aligning with her "calmly inventive" trait, but she lacks internal friction or vulnerability. Her superiority over the antagonist ("his imagination never stretched") reduces the sense of risk, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaela’s physical adaptation to the frictionless world is distinct and grounding, creating a memorable embodied character. However, her transformation from elusive survivor to leader is delivered through summary in the final moments rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and the decision to open the envelope provides a solid agency shift. However, internal states are often delivered via diagnostic labeling ("furiously tranquil," "fury at the erasure") rather than dramatized, embodied contradiction. The character feels more like a vessel for the theme than a living person navigating immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is competent but static, lacking internal struggle or vulnerability. She dominates the antagonist physically and intellectually from the start, reducing tension. The mechanical arm provides "inhuman speed" without an on-page cost or drawback, functioning more as a superpower than a character-defining constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Character motivation is legible, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic dialogue from Marcus ("You molt because you're surviving") rather than dramatized discovery. This label-speak externalizes the internal arc, reducing the emotional weight of Solomon's decision to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    Character motivation is legible, but traits like "wistful by nature" and "strategically creative" are delivered via summary labels rather than dramatized tactics. The emotional realization relies on filter verbs ("Marcus understood") rather than embodied reaction, distancing the reader from the pivotal internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is functionally motivated by her role, but her internal state relies on the label "luminous doubt" rather than embodied contradictory impulses. Her primary choice—planting the seed—feels inevitable given her job, lacking a moment of genuine hesitation or high-stakes personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marisol is largely reactive, receiving her epiphany from the mentor figure rather than earning it through pressurized struggle. Takeshi functions more as a "magical wise man" device to dispense the solution than as a fully realized character, reducing the emotional weight of Marisol's internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina's motivation to transform trauma into art is rooted in consistent traits like feeling vibrations without sound; contradictory impulses (rectify vs. transform) act in her choice to self-map over therapy. Final self-mapping choice earned by prior device calibration and Claire's test, foreclosing rectification with felt cost of enduring silence. Claire applies relational pressure via mouthed "perfect."

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Meridian's weariness embodied in "slow from decades of laying the drowned to rest" anchors motivation; flaw of past stubbornness drives pivotal realization and transformation into keeper with eternal cost. Internal conflict emerges through failed returns of souls, compelling higher-stakes actions. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing ("She had been inadvertently stubborn") borders telling but ties to concrete lens cue.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's gently persistent trait drives micro-choices like repeated runs and 13 rings, earning the final step-back with embodied heart-hammering cost. Secondary characters like Petrov and Sasha apply targeted pressure, revealing generational rift. Minor slip: internal conflict more summarized in reflection than simultaneous impulses in the speech beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina's motivation rooted in past life memory compels her micro-choices like persisting with breathing; woman's grief embodied in panic pattern forces relational crucible. Internal curiosity shows contradiction between artist/healer identities acting simultaneously. Minor therapy-speak ("grief lodged") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation to discover time's texture drives micro-choices like entering the maze, embodied in trembling fingers and intensifying visions; interiority concrete via fractured perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her neutron-star lens on collapse vs. transformation feels lived, not pasted. The final refusal to wash her hands is a micro-choice that costs her sterile identity, earned by twenty-eight days of observed dust. Flaw is present: she clings to control yet yields, but the contradiction is mostly told in reflective blocks rather than dramatized in-scene. Still, the arc of inherited impulse → witnessing looseness → embodied mess lands with credible humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority stays concrete—scarred palms, kiln knowledge, frost reading—and her renunciation of providence in favor of slow condensation is earned. The “steadily adaptive” label appears, risking diagnostic-speak, but is immediately anchored to lungs & glass-work, so only a −0.2. No contradictory impulses staged in simultaneous scene-action, so 9-bar missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s contradictory drives—her need to re-enter the audible world vs. her embrace of silence—are embodied in every beat: striking the fork she cannot hear, mapping her own face for music. The sister visit is not just support but a live test that forces Marina to confront whether her silent compositions satisfy human connection. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “ghost of what music had been” felt through bone, not labeled as loss. The final self-mapping is a micro-choice that costs her the last illusion that the system is only for others, earning her stasis in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Meridian’s interiority is rich and embodied—“her movements slow from decades of laying the drowned to rest” shows lived weariness. Her stubborn mis-practice is shown through the lens revelation, not told. The final shift to eternal keeper is credible, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s “gently persistent” trait is shown through repeated night runs and the bell-ringing ritual, anchoring motive; the final declaration is prepared by weeks of embodied action. Interiority is concrete (“heart hammered against her ribs”) and stays inside her perceptual bounds. Cost is legible—dwindling savings, frost-risk, public exposure—so Earned Stasis feels earned. Secondary characters remain sketches, but since they function as collective pressure rather than relationship crucible, the arc coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s interiority is concrete—her noticing of the woman’s rib-cage breathing pattern, her own four-seven-eight count—yet the “past-life” motive is asserted rather than embodied under pressure. The elderly woman’s shift from panic to steady breath is dramatized and costly, earning the micro-healing. Marina’s final micro-choice—packing the warm crystal—shows earned renunciation, but the smoke-tasting name remains abstract, keeping the contradiction from fully acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s vocation and retro-cognition are one: every design choice is simultaneously memory-mining. The trembling hand on the notebook, the deliberate planting of a root bridge that she has already seen fall—all externalize her interior fracture without diagnostic jargon. Her final dispersal is the only logical extension of a self that has been lived by every prior instant; the cost is the body itself. No secondary characters appear, so the crucible is internal and flawlessly sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s “chains as choreography” embodiment and the final bolt-cutter moment give visible, felt cost; her quiet librarian lie and the choice to reveal the jar crystallize a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—she notices “iron links singing soft percussion against her hip bones,” not abstract freedom. The patiently strategic trait is dramatized through nightly mapping of the keys, not labeled. Only minor slip: the young soldier’s instant conversion feels slightly under-cooked, muting the relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—colors murmur, blues keen, her thumb prints living cells into the silver. The inverted-synesthesia never slips into diagnosis-speak; it drives every micro-choice (she hears the shape of the client’s trauma). Her endurance of terminal illness is never declared, only lived: she eats the impossible apples, keeps forging. Final imprint joins her body to the device, a cost that feels inherited, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority glows—her habit of “stealing” light-moments is embodied in the tactile jar, her pulse, the tilt of her gaze. The shift from hoarder to witness is credible because every beat of discovery (photo of herself, moon-curtain, elder’s test) forces a micro-choice that loosens her grip. Cost is visible: she relinquishes the entire collection, foreclosing the old identity. Yet the “quietly savvy” trait is asserted more than demonstrated; we never see her actually outwit a mark on stage.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s solitude-as-theatre habit is vividly particularized and embodied; her interior contradiction—mourning permanence while liquefying glass—drives every micro-choice. The renunciation of city/answers is credible, but the “thawing heart” thesis is declared more than dramatized in scene. Embodied emotion is strong (frost-rimed palm, chest-weight), yet the final smile feels slightly unearned because no alternative path is foregone on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands steady as she accepts terror—showing embodied contradiction. The twin reveal lands cleanly because her muscle-memory cipher reading seeds doubt early. Carson’s stature as “mentor turned predator” is economical yet chilling; his single seashell prop carries the weight of stolen childhood. Only the line “She had outwitted him…” drifts into explanatory summary rather than dramatized choice, keeping the score just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s shift from caravan daughter to starless cartographer is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—pressing against stone, feeling ambered hush as “texture”—that externalize her obsession. The interior contradiction (fear vs. wonder) stays live in scene, but the oracle remains off-stage, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is N/A; head-count stays clean. Final Earned Stasis is credible: she smiles in absolute dark, having forfeited family, safety, and literal daylight. Cost is scaled to length; still, the oracle’s motivation is inherited rather than self-revealed, capping the arc just below the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    J-7’s interior contradiction—mechanical compulsion versus metaphysical hunger—surfaces in the six-hour broom-suspension flashback and culminates in the choice to lift, play, and set down the violin; the cost is the acceptance of eternal looping as consciousness. The “patient accumulation of moments” insight is earned, not asserted, and the refusal to escape the loop reads as credible renunciation with visible ontological price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s quiet registrar role is credibly embodied—she notices, hesitates, then acts—but Viktor’s shift from silent bureaucrat to guilt-bathed confessor arrives as exposition dump rather than embodied beat, softening the cost. Elena functions as sympathetic ear, not pressure source, so relationship crucible never ignites. Interiority stays concrete (“hand trembled against the cold wall”), yet the decisive pivot—“your honesty freed me”—is asserted, not dramatized with contradictory impulse. Earned stasis is present but under-costed because Viktor’s prior silence is told, not tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—tracing cracks, polishing marbles—while her pragmatic deception and long-game sabotage spring from a single plausible grudge. The final act of planned neglect and resurrection shows a hierarchy of values (truth over job security) with visible cost in the cracked, sun-lit marbles. Marcus exists mostly as echo and witness, so relationship pressure is light; the real crucible is her wager with the garden itself. That wager lands as credible endurance, not epiphany, keeping ambiguity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.7)
    Renna’s obliging nature is shown through repeated compliance, but the climactic reveal hinges on secret work already completed; the decisive moment is revelation, not a fresh choice under pressure. Interiority is concrete—grease-stained fingers, trembling hands—yet the core contradiction (meek mechanic vs. bold theorist) is told more than dramatized in-scene. Relationship with Voss supplies a micro power shift, but status dynamics stay polite; no cost is extracted from her meekness. Earned stasis is credible: she accepts exposure, but the cost feels intellectual, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste’s “in-between” identity is embodied in her wading, lantern-lit search, but interiority drifts toward thematic self-explanation (“she lived in between spaces…”) rather than fresh contradiction under pressure. The decisive find and hug of the journal crystallizes her stance with visible cost; still, we get summary of dormancy (“lately dormant creativity”) instead of one micro-choice showing the flaw that kept her stuck. Motivation holds, but a single unexpected reaction mid-flood could have sharpened the arc from discovery to commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s guilt and the swallowed truth are interiorized through trembling hands and the accidental smudge; her decision to recalibrate sensors is earned by the delirious confession and carries visible cost (“certainty is what killed her”). Contradictory impulses—need for scientific rigor vs. need to honor Eva’s margins—act simultaneously in the final beat. The only drag: “had swallowed a truth” is half-summary; full embodiment would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid (“drowsy alertness… thoughts moved through honey”) and her investigative drive is consistent, but the story withholds any contradiction or micro-choice once she enters the tunnel; she only records what she finds. The decisive pivot—realizing guilt, not ghosts—occurs off-stage in summary, so the cost feels reported rather than embodied. No visible renunciation or charged refusal lands on the page; the backpacked valve wheel is evidence, not a totem that forces a new stance. The character texture is strong, but the arc is observation-heavy, choice-light.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior monologue is rich, idiosyncratic, and constant; the “grip reality loosely” mantra underwrites every micro-choice, culminating in the earned renunciation of exact memory. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, however—only recursive affirmation—so the arc is flatter than a true 9-band. Still, the stance is lived-in, specific, and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya’s “softly adaptive” manner is shown more via label than embodied contradiction; her interiority is filtered, calm, therapeutic, without visible internal rift under pressure. Mrs. Chen and Diane carry the relational pressure; Maya observes but does not enact a choice that forecloses her own path—so the cost lands on the mother-daughter dyad, not the therapist. Motivations track cleanly: the curl triggers Diane’s crack, the lullaby cues memory, but the protagonist’s stakes remain observational rather than crucible-tested. Voice stays consistent, yet the focalizer’s decision space stays flat—no micro-choice tightens her own options, so the “mellow” trait never complicates her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian’s interiority is poetically rendered—“listening to walls,” “archive of echo”—but remains observational; no micro-choice visibly alters her course or costs her anything. The remembered Caroline functions as a secondary pressure source, yet the historian’s stance stays static: she merely transcribes, never risks. The final act of copying is too gentle to register as a renunciation with on-page cost; the emotional price is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Margaret’s contradictory drives—denying meaning while craving transformation—surface in her jazz metaphor and final smile; her micro-choice to keep writing crystallizes Earned Stasis. Interiority is concrete (“floor tilt slightly”), emotion embodied without label-speak. Flaw (restlessness) directly spawns the plot; cost is the lifelong accidental espionage she must now own. Relationship with the stranger is brief but pressure-charged, forcing her stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micah’s calm, cerebral approach and Elena's terrified stillness are sketched through embodied action and sensory choice rather than labels; his “muffled clarity” voice and tool-rituals create a distinctive interiority. The internal contradiction—priestly duty versus techno-philosophical method—drives every beat and is paid for in the final shudder of exhaustion. One flaw: we never see Elena make a micro-choice under duress; she remains passive vessel, so the relationship crucible doesn’t quite crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—homesickness for her own past self and the drive to manufacture meaning for strangers—are shown in concrete beats: shell-to-temple, pen-to-paper, memory-to-fortune. Interiority is specific (“time moved like honey”), never label-heavy. The final renunciation (ceasing to write, accepting tomorrow’s return) is earned through the visible drain of exhaustion, a felt cost. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority stays coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (“gift and curse,” “complete and fractured”) play out in embodied micro-choices like letting gravity reclaim her. The tablet’s infinite catalogue of selves supplies relentless externalized pressure, so each flicker she notices is a micro-choice that tilts her stance. The final renunciation—accepting that she is the labyrinth—carries visible cost: the viaduct dims beneath her and the tablet falls silent. What keeps this from the top band is slight over-cranked diction (“periodically eternal,” “conceptual repricing”) that edges toward diagnostic label-speak rather than strictly lived sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her deafness filters every observation through vibration and texture—but her contradictory impulse (the need to *feel* music yet fear that even vibration has gone numb) is declared rather than dramatized in-scene. The micro-choice of lifting the broken needle is concrete, yet the story tells us the students’ transformation instead of letting us witness one student’s embodied release; that keeps the emotional arc one step removed. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent, and the final image of the broken needle as “resurrection” lands as earned renunciation of her earlier despair.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s meticulous nature is shown through tactile micro-choices (unscrewing the tube, noting pigeon posture) and her integrity dilemma is embodied, not declared. The interior contradiction—comply vs. protect—drives every beat; the final renunciation (parallel documentation) costs her solitude and safety, felt in the fading-light image. No stock labels; even “credibly curious” is demonstrated via action. The only limit: we never see her flaw compound into error; she’s almost preternaturally competent, muting jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dalton’s contradictory impulse—seeking scent while fearing memory—drives every beat; the final refusal to swap vials crystallizes a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Interiority stays lantern-broker-specific (“grammar of loss,” “crystal patterns”) and viscerally embodied. Only micro-slip: “diagnostic” tag-line about “why I can’t stop” could be more embodied; still, the moment is saved by immediate tactile vial action. Earned stasis lands because prior beats foreclose any lesser comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his fingers on the rope, the notebook in his pocket—but the climactic “understanding” is declared rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something on the page. Elena’s ethical-playful trait surfaces only in a single spoken line; we never see it bend her tactics. The shared beat of staring into the liquid wall crystallizes stance, yet the absence of a visible forfeiture keeps the change from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The violinist’s interiority is concrete—her acoustical ear, the memory of bonfire stories, the decision to play fragments rather than whole songs—all anchored to present stimuli. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, however; her arc is steady rather than torn, so the change feels gentle, not costly. Still, the micro-choices (lifting the bowl, matching pitches, leaving the bowl open) are specific and character-bound, earning the quiet renunciation of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s professional thoroughness is dramatized through the tactile ritual of blotter, wrist, filing—a believable habit loop. Her affectionate detachment is embodied when she inhales the client’s pain-residue, a micro-choice that shows both care and clinical distance. The interior contradiction—helping while erasing authenticity—remains active in every beat; no unearned epiphany intrudes. Closure is an Earned Stasis: she knowingly forfeits another shard of her own authenticity, a cost legible in the final filing motion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marlena’s shift from detached broker to advocate is sketched via one reflective beat and a single micro-choice (“I want to initiate something”), credible for 800 words; Theo functions more as thematic mirror than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Interiority is concrete (“shame warming her cheeks”), but the contradictory impulses that would push her from complicity to action are told rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation of her prior invisibility carries visible social cost—she will now spend capital and time—so the change is earned, if compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sculptor’s loneliness-to-belonging arc is credibly embodied: her “boldly sympathetic” advance to strangers, the tactile reed-and-crystal work, the dawn reveal that costs her sleep and former identity. Interiority stays concrete (“warmth in her chest” vs. outsider ache). The final realization that the tag was always already found is a sharp earned renunciation—she accepts the ritual, not the prize—paying the price of permanent self-redefinition.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s illustrator-scientist lens is vivid and continuous—she “sketched a nest of wind-sparrows,” “documented in her journals,” and her perceptual hierarchy (visual, taxonomic, temporal) drives every micro-choice. The internal contradiction—chronicling vs. stealing time—remains embodied in the warming/cooling pendant and the visible drain of borrowed seconds, giving the final release a felt cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority is consistent, specific, and pressured. The only bar to 9+ is that the climactic “uncage” sequence is slightly rushed, so the visible bodily toll (tremor, fatigue) is only implied, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marius’s interior contradiction—mathematician vs. conjurer, husband vs. man who can’t name his loss—remains concrete and embodied (digging, watering, tear-filled cracks). The micro-choice to plant the glass eyes is both ritual and experiment, foreclosing skepticism at a palpable cost: the eyes dissolve, the flower stays. His flaw—needing to quantify the unquantifiable—drives the climax and produces the earned insight that absence can be a variable. Voice never slips into label-speak; grief is shown through tactile patience, not diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—her reflex to hide versus her new need to be seen—are dramatized in embodied, present-tense beats (emerging through the grate, palm-open gesture). The interiority is concrete, never drifting into label-speak, and the final choice to reveal herself is causally tied to the remembered warmth of being read to. Micro-choices under pressure (arranging the cache, writing the note) show value hierarchy with visible cost (exposure risk). The boy remains a cipher, but within 800 words the single-POV default holds; secondary-pressure bullet is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interior arc from control to surrender is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—cutting wires, pressing the leaf, fielding Mrs. Chen’s remark—each registering visible cost. Marcus’s circuitous speech pattern is more than quirk; it externalizes the reluctance that must be overcome, tying voice to motive. The transformation is credibly reluctant: he shakes, back-tracks, hedges even while acting. Flaw: the “storm-after-storm” shorthand compresses weeks into summary, muting body-level friction that could have pushed this to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The painter’s insomnia and compulsive painting are embodied through ash-gray sand under fingernails and the amber brooch’s weight “like an anchor,” showing contradictory impulses (creation vs exhaustion). The final choice to stay awake “by choice” crystallizes a credible shift: meaning is now actively chosen, not chased. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, “haggard awe” is shown in trembling hands and traded brooches. The only minor slack: the trio’s individuality blurs, so relationship-as-crucible pressure stays diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—teacher of wonder blindsided by her own creation—lands cleanly, embodied in her chill of recognition. The pilgrim is thin but functional as a catalyst; his rapture moment crystallizes the cost. The final smile of surrender shows earned stasis with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maris’s exile-return motive is crisp, but her interiority flattens into label-speak (“navigated absences, the cartography of what was no longer there”). The single decisive boat-trip is earned, yet the prior beats show no contradictory impulse in scene; visions arrive as gift, not fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “analytically artistic” eye is repeatedly dramatized: she kneels to trace the cracks, sketches them, then chooses the smallest truth instead of grand secrets—an earned micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The grandmother’s punch and the imperative “follow what others cannot see” supply clear, pressure-heightening motive. Interiority stays concrete (“certainty bloom in her chest,” “tears blurred…vision”) and avoids label-speak. Flawed passivity is not explored, and the moment of selection is summarized rather than scenically lingered-on, keeping the score just below the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—‘kindness hollowed her bones’—and her micro-choice to palm the tile launches the visions. The empathy-overload flaw is credible, but the grief-to-hope swing is compressed into a single epiphanic beat; we are told she feels ‘less guarded’ rather than shown a concrete behavioral shift that costs her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vesper’s immortal boredom is textured through lived detail—“seventeen thousand solar cycles,” “funeral after funeral”—but her interior contradiction is stated, not dramatized in-scene; the final step toward “spaces beyond goodbye” shows a micro-choice, yet the cost is more conceptual than corporeal, keeping the arc just shy of full pay-off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory inheritance—her father’s forged ink pot versus his injunction to honesty—drives every micro-choice; the moment she rinses the SD card and documents the truth in the logbook, we see the costly, embodied renunciation of his legacy. Pavel’s grief-strained calculation (“How do I repay this?”) forces her to articulate a new ethic: testimony as currency. Interiority stays concrete (“staining her fingers indigo,” “wind through mountain passes”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slack is Pavel’s brief slide into “desperate calculation” cliché, but it’s instantly re-grounded in their shared vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stationer’s quiet obsession with “temporal texture” is embodied in the minute ritual of lamp-listening and gold-ink transcription; her micro-choices (recording hum, sealing the sheet, walking the maze) externalize an inner contradiction between fact and invention. The Earned Stasis—she keeps inventing, keeps walking, keeps paying the cost of silence—lands with felt weight, though the interior progression is so muted it risks sameness. Still, the absence of tidy epiphany and the persistent solitude feel credible, not safe. Flaw: no secondary pressure character, so status/relationship crucible is moot; interiority alone carries the beat and almost suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The legally-nameless protagonist is vividly particularized through her tidal rituals and sensory filter of rust, salt, and poison; her contradictory impulses (yearning for justice yet accepting erasure) are dramatized in her nightly climb to the container roof. Micro-choices—tucking the label into the notebook, timing her eavesdropping to low tide—reveal a hierarchy of values that culminates in Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual ghosthood to keep excavating truth. The missing 0.3 comes from the absence of any on-page relationship crucible; pressure is entirely atmospheric, not interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s skeptical-turned-wonder interiority is embodied and consistent; her micro-choice to paint her own blood onto the shell crystallizes the arc. The contradiction between lifelong debunking and surrender to wonder is dramatized in scene, not summary. The cost is felt: her previous professional identity is foreclosed. Voice remains distinct, though a few “gloomy cheerfulness” abstractions edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—selling gentrification while plotting resistance—drives every beat; the stone chip migrates from nostalgia anchor to seed metaphor with visible cost when she over-paints the yellow star. The final cooperative pivot is earned because her nightly graffiti practice has already rehearsed compromise through layered code. Still, Marcus remains a plot conduit rather than a pressure source; his stake in dual loyalty is asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—scientific reverence vs. filial duty—are dramatized in the embodied gesture of planting the grain; the micro-choice to press it “gently into the dust” crystallizes her values and foreshadows the Earned Stasis. Her curiosity is not label-only: it drives the chemical-set choreography and the decision to endure the consortium’s erasure. The cost is visible in the final image: she walks away knowing Valentina will be “golden, eternal, and hers” only in photographs. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into therapy-speak, and the flaw (idealistic inability to stop corporate force) compounds realistically.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s blind expertise is credibly embodied through touch-water diagnostics and tool memory, but her interiority stays safely on the surface—no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her calm. The repair beats show competence, not struggle; the “magnetic calm” feels like a resting state rather than a cost-laden stance. Because no credible mistake or trade-off appears, the arc is flat: she fixes the drone and feels satisfied, but nothing is foreclosed. The artisan trait is vivid; the person remains untested.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s dry skepticism and obsession with river-sources stay vivid, but her interiority flips into explanatory summary (“Understanding crystallized…”) rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure; the micro-choice to walk onto the ice tomorrow is declared, not dramatized, so the cost is prospective, not palpable on-page. The “clever bastard” moment hints at layered self-reproach yet doesn’t force an immediate tactical shift or visible renunciation today. Competence and motive are clear; the missing beat is a present-tense decision with flesh-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bell tuner’s cryptic stillness and ritual walking create a coherent, if opaque, interior logic; her patience is shown through embodied action (three days of heel-toe circuits) rather than label. Yet she never faces an on-page contradiction that forces a costly choice—her success feels pre-ordained, so the “earned” bar for 9+ isn’t cleared. The townspeople’s abrupt reversal is observed, not filtered through her stakes, keeping her arc flat. Still, the micro-choices (where she strikes the fork, when she stops) remain consistent with the trait set, satisfying the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s interiority—“instincts screamed… overriding instinct”—shows credible contradiction under pressure, but the pivot from solitary scientist to lone savior is compressed into one beat with no prior flaw or misbelief dramatized. Thalia’s centuries-long endurance is conveyed through gesture and the cracked helmet, giving visible cost, yet her priestess identity is asserted more than tested. The micro-choice to trigger the transfer is embodied and stakes-scaled to the length, earning the +0.2 over the 8.4 quick-test floor.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s inner contradiction—innocent tongue vs. inherited guilt—stays alive in every beat; the micro-choice to keep watching the drowning men while seeking his own “hush” crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The final stance (“hush wasn’t something you found, but something you became”) is earned by the accumulated silence he has practiced, with the cost visible in the bodies he refused to save. Father-shadow as flaw complicates every potential warning, making the refusal to cry out inevitable rather than convenient. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead using concrete images (hayloft, copper light, wooden diamonds) to embody shame.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her chest “ached with an emotion she couldn’t name,” her thumb worries the bead—yet the decisive shift from passive isolation to active, multi-lifetime caretaking is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. The grandmother-to-Elara bloodline motivation is clear, but the on-page cost (accepting perpetual night, lifelong solitude) is summarized in the final paragraph rather than embodied in a moment of choice. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and character-specific, and the emotional contradiction—simultaneous dread and devotion—rings true.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “strange certainty humming in her chest” after sleepwalking embodies the pull of the labyrinth. Contradictory impulses (obedience to precedent vs. the call to re-enliven) coexist in scene, not summary. The final descent to join the walkers caps a credible arc: her flaw—solitary artistry—yields to communal risk, cost legible in the silent loom above. Only the council confrontation is slightly under-motivated; their capitulation feels swift, blunting the full 9-band.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
    <comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty loom overhead reweights everything with felt opportunity-cost. Accumulative lens holds—each panel, each new walker adds density until the council must re-see the maze. “The labyrinth breathed” crystallizes the before/after without preachiness. No orientation debt; causality never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory tug between exile-honed detachment and bone-anchored belonging is dramatized in every micro-choice—she caresses root-wrapped skulls, postpones the dig, decides to haul the sundial up. Interiority stays concrete (“some internal architecture,” “hollowed something”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—leaving again but now with a return she feels as cost—is legible and earned. Only the priest’s single-scene presence dilutes relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya’s interiority is consistently concrete—tracing chalk, folding the letter to a thumbnail square—yet her contradictions (digital implant vs. analog faith) stay summarized, not dramatized. The clipboard lineage and “digital suicide” want hint at deeper flaws, but the 800-word scope keeps them gestural; we see no micro-choice where her resolve actually wobbles. Still, her tactile rituals and final moment of “writing tomorrow’s codes” earn a credible renunciation with felt cost. Characterization is strong for length, but the absence of a live opposing force keeps relationships from becoming crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s “fool” persona is embodied in micro-choices—cookies, giggles, harmless embroidery—while her interior contradiction (urgent dread vs. forced lightness) stays vivid. The final pivot to warning the palace guard is earned: every prior stitch and eavesdropped silence compounds into a single, costly act of exposure that forecloses her invisible safety. No secondary on-page relationship pressures her, so status crucible is inactive; her solitude is the point. The only drag is a faint hint of author-narration in “wisdom disguised as foolishness,” but it’s brief.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Isla’s longing is embodied in her clutching the unsent letters, and the memory-vision lets us see the trembling hope she once missed; the apology she chooses at the end is causally linked to that new knowledge, so the arc is earned. The medium stays more archetype than individual, but her function is to catalyze, not to decide, so the slight flatness is acceptable at this length. Overall, credible interiority and a visible cost on the page lift this above mid-band; only the medium’s lack of contradiction keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s occupation as Pacific conflict-zone translator is dramatized: her instant recognition of “khlong,” the coral fragment she has carried through evacuations, and her reflex to catalogue detail while drugged all root motivation in lived expertise. The micro-choice to offer translation help rather than comfort shows a hierarchy of values—language before sentiment—yet the arm she slips around the child shows the same impulse has soft human limits. Interiority stays concrete (“lotus-hearted ache” is an image, not a diagnosis) and her flaws—emotional hoarding, professional overreach—surface in the gesture of beginning to “write them together,” foreclosing solitary mourning at visible cost: sharing custodianship of memory. The girl’s shrewd innocence is equally embodied: motionless legs, guarded blank face, yet trust extended with the cast; her silence is a tactic, not absence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—art as joy versus art as work—arrives pre-explained, not dramatized in scene, so the turn feels pre-loaded rather than earned. Once on-site, her micro-choices (tracing the fresco, switching from projection to amplification) are visible, embodied, and costly (battery drain, public exposure), earning the laugh that ends her creative apnea. The “pensive mirth” epiphany is still articulated in abstract labels rather than a final contradictory impulse, keeping her arc just shy of the 8-band where flaw and cost would collide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marta’s interiority is vivid—her shifting certainty about waking/dreaming is embodied in breath, pulse, nickel weight—but her “methodically playful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no scene shows method clashing with play to cost her a choice. The final surrender is credible, but the absence of any secondary character or status crucible keeps the arc lone-note. Micro-choices (sing, press palms) trace values, yet lack a visible trade-off that scars. Still, the recursive identity loop feels character-specific, not template.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Malachi’s outlaw-charisma is sketched quickly and consistently; his “honey-smooth” voice against trembling hands shows embodied contradiction. The daughter vignette supplies a sharpened motive, but the interior shift from charming rogue to guardian-of-sparks is asserted more than dramatized within the single meeting. No micro-choice under tightening pressure is shown on-page; the leap from idea to city-wide adoption is causal but unfelt by him in-scene. Still, the crisp sensory anchoring and distinct speech texture keep him above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s three-century insomnia is declared rather than dramatized; we never see her waiver or micro-choices under its accumulating cost. Mira arrives more vividly—“shyly unstoppable” is embodied in her concrete entry and dirt-under-nails presence—but the poet’s arc still leans on abstract longing. The final “something close to rest” lands as thematic label; we get no embodied contradiction or visible price for the shift from solitary verse to shared planting, so the change feels gentle rather than inevit-able.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miren’s quiet stewardship is rendered through tactile micro-choices—rotating humidity, cradling the cracked tube—that betray a latent contradiction: she conserves feelings she can no longer feel. The foxglove regret is embodied, not labeled, and her final act of forging a new chime from a dead orchid crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the last illusion of perfect preservation. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock caretaker tropes intrude. The only flaw is a slight over-sweetness in the closing “love directed toward ghosts,” which edges toward abstract sentimentality rather than embodied ache.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s guilt-driven solitude and Kael’s guarded hope are rendered through micro-gestures (turning the ink well, tapping fingers) that externalize interior contradiction; the final hand-clasp is earned because her months of “carefully reckless” isolation have visibly cost them both, making the restored collaboration feel freighted rather than facile.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s vocation and moral compass stay consistent; her micro-choices (palm on stone, ash-and-water test, three-day restoration) all flow from the same practical ingenuity. Interiority is concrete, never abstract—“paper trembled…fragile as hope” shows felt cost. The absence of on-page opposition dulls status friction, but her solitary problem-solving still forces a visible renunciation of simpler, zero-sum fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s reinvention of self after the fire and her guilt-riven refusal to read the messages she ferries make her interior contradiction vivid; the moment she presses “play” and hears her younger voice inside the attic is a micro-choice that visibly costs. “Learning to trust again felt like training pigeons in reverse” is concrete, character-specific metaphor that reveals hierarchy of values. Her final decision to speak the truth to Yuki is earned by the recording’s shock and the dust-mote ritual that mirrors suspension between hope/grief. Secondary pressure from Yuki is light but sufficient for the length; the Mars chip functions more as talisman than active constraint, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—needing to decode her parents’ spatial logic while fearing what she’ll find—stays alive in every tactile choice: kneeling at the table, tracing grain, deciding not to open the logbook again. The micro-choice to leave the book closed renounces the fantasy of parental repair; that renunciation costs her the comfort of certainty and is earned by the preceding grain-reading scene. Featherly determination is shown, not labeled, in the way her fingertips “whorl” with her father’s persistence. Only the mother remains a cipher, but that absence is thematically justified and does not flatten the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—astrologer turned marine-pattern hunter—lives in her handling of the burnt feather; her “softly ingenious” trait enables the power-core discovery we hear about but never see, muting cost. Chen is a courteous sounding board, not a pressure source, so relationship crucible is thin. The final shared exhale crystallizes belonging, but the earned price is atmospheric, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calla’s interior contradiction—cheerful speech against unsmiling eyes—embodies the “cheerful gloom” mandate, yet her micro-choices (planting the seed, pressing glass) are reactive rather than vein-open; the final covenant (“I’ll remember you”) is earned but the cost feels conceptual, not embodied. Childhood motive is thinly cued; no tactile price (bleeding knee, lost tool) anchors the turn. Voice remains consistent and occupation-specific, but diagnostic tag “melancholy optimism” nearly slips into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s “analytical” label stays mostly declarative; we’re told she calculates vectors but never shown a concrete equation or mistake that would humanize the gift. The dropped-ball and scattered-cards beats externalize motive, yet her interiority recycles phrasing (“orchestrated serendipity… she’d never spoken aloud”) instead of revealing contradiction under pressure. Because the final renunciation—slipping away before applause—merely repeats the opening modesty, the cost feels lightweight; the stake never grows heavier than a charming hobby. The characterization charms but stays safely cerebral, not compelled by risk.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—her bones “recognize lunar gravity,” her palm tingles as the speck anchors her—but the moment she decides to tattoo her memories the emotional contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized (“she understood then what she must do”). The final endurance carries visible cost: her body becomes “a map of what was,” flesh inscribed under starlight. One more beat of internal resistance or fear would have pushed this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Samuel’s contradictory impulses—duty to replace glass vs. compulsion to save the atrium—are alive in every micro-choice (unlocking but not working, dropping stones to “read” light). His embodied emotion (“searching the panes for meanings”) and grandfather-haunted interiority feel particular, not therapeutic. The final renunciation (leaving with the portfolio, not tools) costs him the easy paycheck and is earned by the stone-born patterns he has learned to decode. Occupational detail (lead came, hatch for cleaning) is folded into action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory pull toward the ridge and away from his father’s guilt is viscerally embodied; the porcelain box as tactile memory anchors every micro-choice. The final “I choose it knowingly” crystallizes the inherited bargain with cost felt in his scarred hand. Only minor slippage: the leap from reading the journals to total comprehension feels one beat rushed, blunting the full force of contradiction at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—equations in tides, theorems in stars—and her micro-choice to add the silver glass is embodied and stakes-laden. The “logical dreamer” contradiction stays active, but the other-Mayas remain external mirrors rather than crucibles, so relational pressure is absent and the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the endurance of observation and the final smile across selves earn a credible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but her decisive shift—accepting the burden of belief—rests on an off-stage empathy for Eleanor rather than a dramatized clash of values; the “visible cost” is asserted (“she understood”) not embodied in a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aina’s contradictory stillness vs. the singing compulsion is embodied in shoulder-perching birds and cracked voice; the borrowed heartbeat constrains nightly vigils and steers the final wrap-up of mirrors. The moment she sinks onto wet stone pays the cost of this endurance, foreclosing rest. Interiority stays concrete, but the calm trait is asserted more than tested—no visible trade-off under pressure. Motivation is legible; a hair more enacted contradiction would clinch 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mirena’s grief-carved clipboard and ritualized memory give her a sharp, specific interior; the moment she touches Kordas’s shoulder embodies “operatively gentle” with visible cost.  The final kneel is earned because the text has shown her decades of failure etched in ebony.  What keeps this from the top band is that Kordas and Threll remain functional symbols rather than fully contradictory people under pressure—their dialogue states pain more than it reveals new, complicating layers.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory interiority—engineered extinction vs. secret sentiment—is dramatized through embodied salt-kneeling and shaking hands. The final renunciation (walking away while the egg broadcasts) is earned by the prior causal chain of bribes, drought, murder of rivers. One decimal off 9+ only because the “sentiment” tag is once asserted rather than revealed through micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celestine’s interiority is lush and embodied—her breath, spine, dancer’s stance, micro-gesture of palm or tilted head all reveal a mind negotiating chastity-as-power while craving self-definition. Contradictory impulses (reflect vs. become) coexist in the same beats, culminating in the earned renunciation of her ornamental role. The cost—her future safety inside the court—is legible in the guards’ instinctive retreat. Voice stays singular; no stock “courtesan” shorthand intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marcus’s serenity is stated rather than embodied; the interior contradiction between “ethical storytelling” and his partner’s charge of exploitation is announced but never dramatized in a visible micro-choice. The only embodied cost is the mute freeze of the puppets mid-gesture, yet this is Marcus’s decision, not a forced crucible, so the felt price is oblique. His motivation is coherent but static; no flaw complicates the final stance, so the arc feels more milieu-portrait than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sera’s interiority is concrete—her fingers stiff from knots, her skin tasted by monarchs—and her micro-choices (gathering wings, threading them, sitting still while proboscises probe) reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak. The flaw–virtue ledger stays balanced: she is competent yet powerless, meticulous yet resigned, and the moment she completes the spiral she accepts the cost of witness over intervention. No contradictory impulses are shown in simultaneous scene; the reflection blocks are anchored but do not tilt present tactics. The renunciation is credible, yet the absence of a second live option keeps the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s guilt-driven freeze and tactile re-awakening are embodied through bronze dust under fingernails and aurora trembling on the rope; the contradiction between “technically gentle” fingers and the brute force required to unweave sacred flax crystallizes her stakes. Interiority stays concrete—she reads rope tension the way others read text—never sliding into diagnostic label-speak. The final choice to cast rather than ring the names is earned by the prior braid-by-braid labor we watch, paying the cost in years and fingertip numbness visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is evocative—“she let herself slip sideways out of time”—but remains atmospheric rather than contradictory; no concrete micro-choice under pressure shows her values colliding. The moment of revelation is passively received in dream, so the decisive change is not visibly earned by prior agency. Still, her perceptual voice is singular and consistent, and the final acquiescence carries a lightly felt cost. It suffices for a short lyric arc but stops short of crucible-level character work.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete throughout (“counted each candle stub,” “pulse quickened”), and the frugal, starved-scientist trait stays consistent. The final quiet endurance—tucking the tile away for tomorrow’s scarce observations—earns its cost under the Accumulative lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; reflection dominates action, so the arc is more stance-crystallization than overt change, keeping it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s “pacifist-schemer” duality is shown, not told, in her gentle hands-off body-work and strategic interruptions (“Before you decided what it meant”). Marcus’s micro-shifts—tighter grip on the box, changed breathing—embody the grudge without cliché. Both characters stay within one emotional register, but the beat-to-beat changes matter and the final weeping feels proportionate to the pressure applied.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliane’s interior contradiction—steady hands vs. eroding boundary—plays out in embodied micro-choices (setting mirrors, breathing with the dream). The final renunciation (burying the mirror) is causally earned and carries visible cost, satisfying 9+ quick test; only a trace of label-speak in “being firmly grounded was the only way to survive” keeps her from full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s guilt-driven persistence and Lisel’s bristling resentment both manifest in embodied micro-choices on the beam; the grandmother’s tremoring knees and the granddaughter’s crossed-arm balance dramatize their hierarchy of values without label-speak. The final shared reach toward the flawed eye crystallizes a credible, costly reconciliation that is foreshadowed by the half-finished orb and the ribbon binding their wrists. Interior contradiction is vivid: Mara admits she “wasn’t completely absent” while still acknowledging the selfishness that fractured the family. No stock gestures; every tactile detail (polishing cloth, calibration rods, hairline fractures in quartz) is character-particular and pressures the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her palm on glass, breath crystallizing, headache from nonlinear logic—yet her decisions remain reactive until the tree-cameo fusion. The “inherited herself backward” realization is relayed as narrated epiphany rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure, softening the cost. Still, her perceptual signature (greenhouse glass, bathroom tiles as thinking chamber) is memorable and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—trailing spines, retrieving the diary, speaking missing prepositions—each aligning with her linguist identity. Interiority stays concrete: the harmonic shift “like a note in the wrong octave” is felt, not labeled. The final smile and whispered agreement embody earned stasis: she accepts perpetual rescue cycles with visible fatigue. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of 9-band depth.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Isla’s interiority is vivid—her grip on the emerald card, the shifting memory of the twins’ ages—yet her motivations stay abstract: “recapture what she’d lost” never converts into a concrete micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The final surrender is lyrically rendered but causally abrupt; we see no prior beat where she actively rejects an alternative path. Still, her perceptual signature (scientist’s precision colliding with ontological vertigo) remains consistent and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marin’s “adaptable archivist” trait is convincingly embodied: she keeps tea, labels by timestamp, and calmly rebraids causality. Interior contradiction is light—she never doubts her mission—yet embodied patience and micro-choices under impossible physics feel individual. Closure gains resonance because her warm methodical nature is the only tool that could parse Chen’s absence-code; the cost is the quiet erasure of her single-timeline memories, felt as new notebook entries she didn’t write. Still, emotional layering stays rational rather than raw, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mapkeeper’s arc is thin: she wants quiet, finds it, and pays only exhaustion. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the text labels her “exhausted” rather than showing a body at its limit. Interiority is poetic but generic (“felt the discord in her bones”) and never bites back against her goal. The closing realization—“quiet had been there all along”—is lovely but unearned by any prior mistake or relinquishment, so the cost feels symbolic rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mera’s custodian role is lived-in—her ritual of sweeping star-paths onto glass with diamond dust is tactile and obsessive—but her internal contradiction (retrocognitive visions vs. present isolation) is summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The “shard of hush” moment is the only beat where her body and choice visibly collide; everywhere else we are told her certainty rather than shown its cost. The ending’s Earned Stasis is credible because she forfeits the last silence she possessed, but the micro-choices that earn it arrive in a single paragraph. Still, the hierarchy of values (pattern over survival) is legible and idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is rich—her “pre-emptive nostalgia” and urgency to archive before the fog melts are felt in body (cord taut, pages filled). Contradictory impulses (record vs. accept impermanence) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The micro-choice to keep working through dawn—knowing the memory she captures will also mutate—earns a credible renunciation with visible fatigue cost. Voice stays specific to her archivist-filter, but Davin’s sudden appearance adds only label-level tension; relationship crucible under-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is thin: “sharp with understanding and mischief” is label-speak, not embodied. Her only micro-choice—lighting the first knot—is swept into summary, so the renunciation (“wandered on”) feels pre-ordained, not paid for. The commander’s flattening is forgivable in a 700-word piece, but Mara’s contradictory impulses (wander vs. stay) stay off-page. earns a functional 6.4 because motive is signal-early and consistent, yet lacks on-page cost or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s interiority is textured through marine-tinged perception (“cataloging the small dramas”) and embodied micro-actions (handing back the cicada). The renunciation of holding Lin here is credible, foreshadowed by the hermit-crab shell test. Minor slack: Lin’s risk is asserted more than dramatized, trimming the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lina’s claustrophobia and hunger for “openness” supply a vivid contradiction, but the interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“tasted like honey and sounded like light”) without embodied cost. No secondary character applies live pressure, so the crucible is self-only; the closing uplift feels willed rather than paid for by a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s calm, ritualized caretaking is credibly lived-in; her micro-choice to remain silent with the grieving man embodies the “teach silence” motive. The interior contradiction—she guides others yet still learns from the storm glass—adds depth. Cost is soft (emotional labor), but the palm-press goodbye shows embodied gratitude that lands as payment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vess’s interiority is rich and specific—her three-century memory, the scanner glove, the tear she can’t date—but the final renunciation, while credible, is telegraphed so early (“she didn’t sit”) that the cost feels pre-absorbed rather than freshly paid. Contradictory impulses (claim vs. guide) are named, yet the beat where they collide is summary, not dramatized. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to reach the 9- gate; the gap is a micro-choice absent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s “surgical” self-immolation is vivid, but her turn to mentor is declared (“She recognized this linkage”) rather than shown in contradictory micro-choices; Sienna remains a passive mirror, trembling but never deciding under pressure. The final beat asks us to believe Maya re-opens her cauterized life because she sees shallow breathing, a motivational leap not grounded in prior scene evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s survivor-guilt and rule-bending itch are concrete early; the bolt-chest fusion is a sensed, embodied cost. Interior contradiction (“mischievous” vs. caretaker of fragile fungi) shows in her choice to shoulder paradoxes. The leap from spam texts to volunteering feels slightly compressed; one more micro-beat of resistance or bargaining would lock motivation. Still, her final stance is legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s refusal to reproduce is stated early and reiterated, but the interior contradiction—her need to “listen” versus the family’s greed—remains summary until the final beat. The embodied tremble when she lifts the deed supplies the first visible cost, earning the quiet renunciation. Still, the dynastic flaw is told more than dramatized; one extra micro-choice under pressure would have pushed this past 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    The knight’s grief and isolation are vivid and embodied; her reawakened hope is dramatized through the apple-pluck. Yet her interiority is sometimes abstract (“shape of possibility”), and the absence of a second character means status/relationship crucibles are inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sarah’s grief-widowhood and meticulous record-keeper nature are anchored in concrete gestures—dust-reading, button-turning, lamp-lighting. The decisive pivot from private mourning to public historian is earned by the causal chain button→list→new file, with visible cost: she stays after dark, heart still broken but hands now tasked with resurrecting twelve erased lives. Interior contradiction (“broken heart / steady hands”) is held in scene, not declared. The only minor slip is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she had found her way to hope”) that slightly blurs the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through the archive hunt and key use, but interiority stays generic (“she remembered,” “she felt”) and the climactic upload happens off-stage, so the cost is declared rather than embodied. The beat where she presses the key into the stone is the only moment where contradiction and choice visibly collide; more of that texture would push her past the 8-threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—saxophone callus on fingers, breath calibrated to silence—and her final stance (renouncing melody to cage prophecy) carries visible cost: she shoulders a dawn ritual that isolates her from the harbor world. The causal link between grandmother’s absence and Elena’s assumption of the hush is legible but compressed; a single flashback line could have sealed the hand-off. Still, her contradictory impulses—yearning to play vs. duty to hush—co-exist in the grotto beats, not in summary. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure satisfy the 9- gate even if the generational baton feels slightly outline-thin.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miren’s tactile seed-sorting ritual, secret monument-building, and the final act of using the moonstone to “write” living moss all embody a believable, earned obsession. Her seventeen-year patience and the hush-hour constraint ground her interiority in concrete time. The climactic internal transformation (she “felt herself begin to transform”) is shown through her subsequent decision to teach others, not merely asserted. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ellis’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her decision to bring the full toolkit, her tactile sifting of ashes, her final smile at the next 3:47 clock all show a tinkerer who thinks with her fingers. The “uncertainly certain” stance is dramatized rather than labeled: she pries the fountain before she knows what’s beneath, a micro-choice that risks her body and tools. Cost is visible—sooty hands, corroded needle, the renunciation of taking only the memory—so the Earned Stasis feels proportionate to length. Minor slip: the admiral’s motives are summarized rather than inferred through Ellis’s body, slightly diluting crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her regret over Kael’s disappearance is embodied in the forge-cold anvil she circles and the wedding-ring gold she sacrifices. The contradictory pull between scientific detachment and maternal guilt is dramatized when she whispers the forgotten birth name while melting her own. Micro-choices (coin spin, gold tracing, naming) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Closure is earned: her stance crystallizes into a lived acceptance of fracture-as-identity, not an abstract epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s grief-anchored vocation and the embodied moment of micro-choice (offering the tooth, asking about shared laughter) create a credible, felt shift; the interiority stays concrete, no tidy epiphany. The “modestly fearless” trait is shown, not labeled, when she descends alone into the cold gorge and lets warped notes touch guilt. One hairline slip: “healing required more than medicine” edges toward diagnostic-speak, but is instantly re-anchored in the daughter-memory cue. Crocodile-tooth gesture and harp music together earn the ghost’s release—cost is the continued solitude and broken instrument—so the change lands with proportionate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kira’s interiority is embodied and specific: the pewter strap, the violet forest, the hated precision of her rewired nerves. Contradictory impulses—seeking the forest while recoiling from its triggers—play out in real time. The closing gesture of touching the strap reads as earned endurance rather than trite acceptance. Only the “mathematics of mercy” refrain drifts toward label-speak, softening the otherwise razor-sharp calibration of flaw and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s desire to recover her grandmother’s erased legacy is clear and personal, but the interiority stays at a curated, slightly abstract register (“crystallized feeling,” “elusively tangible”) that keeps us outside the visceral cost of the discovery; the final beat of resolve is stated rather than dramatized with a micro-choice that shows the price she will now pay.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s quiet competence and ghost-vision are credibly braided; the childhood memory of ceiling letters seeds his obsession without overtelling. His micro-choice to climb and expose the tin ceiling is the hinge that earns the ghost’s release. Interiority stays concrete—“buildings exhaled”—and the cost of carrying “weightless burden” into daylight lands. Voice slips once into averaged prose (“Some repairs…everything to do”), but overall he reads as a lone, specific man acting under spectral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Margritte’s motive—“compress eternity into a moment”—is stated once and never pressured; she never doubts, stalls, or recalibrates. Tessian’s shift from perfection to wonder is legible but happens off-stage, voiced rather than dramatized. No micro-choice under strain reveals contradictory impulses; the press keeps printing and she keeps winning. The arc lands as thematic assertion, not earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Matthias’s shift from revolutionary fire to scholar-poet is embodied in the velvet-swaddled mirrors and shard-lit visions; his interiority stays sensuous and specific (“each arabesque a hymn to moments”). Yet the single on-page choice—uncovering the shard to the mirror—arrives as a quiet coda rather than a crucible; the cost is elegiac, not tactical, so the arc feels more observed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cornelius’s truth-wilting affliction is dramatized in micro-gesture (trembling fingers) and steers every visible choice; the final dawn ascent carries earned cost in bone-deep fatigue. Interiority stays concrete—philosopher’s chip warm against ribs—never sliding into label-speak. One flaw: no contradictory impulse is allowed to surface mid-repair; the hum remains too pure, so the arc feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s shift from factory commodification to reverence for unbottle-able scent is dramatized through micro-choices—squeezing sideways into the crack, uncorking vials of cavern breath. The “sensibly eccentric” label is shown: she keeps practical vials yet kneels to collect intangible stone tears. Interiority is specific—her fingers “catching on calcified protrusions,” the compass “trembled in her hand.” Cost is legible: leaving the compass, she forfeits certitude, accepting mystery as the new working material.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Iris’s interiority is concrete—her noticing of the arch’s “simple curve” refracts her own artistic problem—and her micro-choice to pocket the slide and abandon the GPS crystallizes her arc. The perpetual-learning trait is shown, not labeled, when she re-reads the land by “three currents converged.” Flaws surface in the therapy-adjacent phrase “she felt herself fall into reverie,” but the final renunciation of digital navigation carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test. Still, we never see her hands actually carve or place a stick, so the promised bodily collaboration remains off-stage, capping the score just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina’s quietly-driven trait is shown through night-long painting, not label, and her micro-choice to paint the glass directly (not the cathedral wall) crystallizes her arc with cost. The contradiction between public muralist identity and need for private, moon-soft witness is felt, not stated. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses daylight approval and accepts that her art will blaze only at dawn/dusk. No second character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; headcount stays within limit.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elijah’s embodied terror and Maya’s subsequent mission are vividly rendered, but the retrocognitive merge is stated more than dramatized; we’re told “memory seized her like a fist” rather than shown contradictory impulses colliding inside one body. The final vow to testify lands as credible renunciation because the diary encryption has already exacted a price—her involuntary possession—so the cost feels earned even if interiority during the merge is summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemist’s refusal of wish-escape and her decision to “pour” memory into the bottle are concrete, motive-driven choices that foreclose alternatives with visible cost (solitude, the risk of failure). Interiority stays anchored to action—“she closed her eyes and let the town’s history flood through her”—avoiding label-speak. Yet we get no contradictory impulse mid-scene; her certainty flattens the internal contradiction that the rubric prizes at climax. Still, the earned renunciation lands cleanly and charges the final image, satisfying the 9- test.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam’s interiority is vivid—her eight-year-old memory of “tree-starved” city life collides with the adult’s kinetic ritual at the tree—but the moment of prophetic surrender is slightly over-articulated (“Emotions were prophecies in themselves”). Still, her micro-choice to speak the child’s garbled Etruscan and then relinquish the shaving feels earned and specific, foreclosing the safety of scholarly detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—rage burning while hands stay steady, fingers numb yet precise. The refusal to borrow time crystallizes a hierarchy of values: lineage over expedience, earned over stolen growth. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; the “crucible” is her own paradoxical calm. Cost is visible: she accepts a harder path, leaving frost-prints that starlight will erase—an earned stasis that forecloses the vortex shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s “humility” is shown through caretaker gestures and quiet defiance, not labels; her shift from obedient tester to autonomous listener is embodied in the rope-pulling beat. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where she simultaneously trusts and doubts the sirens—so the arc feels slightly smoothed rather than torn. The final renunciation costs her institutional cover, yet the price is implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s solitary vigil and charcoal tracing ritual are concrete, character-specific actions that externalize his grief and spiritual hunger; the final recognition that “cracks let the light through” is earned by the lantern-glass epiphany. Interiority stays sensuous and embodied, never sliding into self-help jargon. The only minor slack is the late, single-sentence biography (“a marriage ended, a career abandoned”) which tells us pain rather than continuing to show it through ritual or bodily memory.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete—"words turned every relationship into warfare" shows why silence is safety. The micro-choice to rotate the panels in the exact bee-flight pattern is embodied, not abstracted. The final nod is a credible renunciation: he accepts custodianship of others’ unspoken names, costing him perpetual solitude. No contradiction in motive; silence and caretaking braid into one continuous stance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid (“cremation urn fragment pressed against his ribs”) and his motive—finding a way to measure unmeasurable time—drives every beat. The moment he slots the urn shard and hears the click crystallizes a credible, earned shift from lost to entrusted. No secondary character shares the scene, so relationship crucible is N/A; his solitary stance is fully dramatized. Flaw: one slide toward diagnostic self-awareness (“borrowed-time timekeeper” repeated) but corrected by embodied cost at descent.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya’s “quietly attentive” stance is shown through micro-choices—retrieving the feather, opening the notebook, inviting the stranger to sit—each carrying visible, low-key cost in exposure/time. Interiority stays concrete (“searching for the words that would complete her collection”) without therapy-speak; contradictions surface in her acceptance of incompletion while still collecting fragments. The young man’s shift from exhausted self-diagnosis to surprised laughter is embodied, not labeled. Relationship under pressure is the shoreline encounter itself; its altered state is the agreement to meet again, foreclosing solitude for both.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s calmly fatalistic interiority is vivid and consistent; the diary, copper, and oak choices externalize her “nothing to lose” stance without therapy-speak. However, because no second character shares the scene, relational crucible and status pressure are absent, leaving her arc a solitary, if credible, renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s skepticism is credibly luminous—every beat filters the alien enigma through disciplined doubt, culminating in the kneel-and-formula moment. The “artificial pilgrimage” motive is dramatized by micro-choices (climb, descent, tactile contact with amber) rather than label-speak. Emotional arc moves from detached experiment to embodied recognition without tidy epiphany; the cost is the foreclosed option of remaining a detached observer. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“something crack open inside her chest”) edge toward cliché and keep this just shy of 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Erasmus’s grief-turned-gardening motive is vivid and embodied; the seed-scattering micro-choices show a hierarchy of values (memory vs renewal). Interiority stays concrete, but the absence of any live opposing pressure keeps the arc more observational than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Finder’s wartime reflexes and present fatigue are convincingly embodied; the leaf-cube she’s kept for fifteen years shows a concrete hierarchy of values. Interiority stays sparse and world-weary—no therapy-speak—yet the moment she traces the grooves her pulse quickens in a single, physical cue. The reunion choice is foreshadowed by her carrying a reminder of beauty, so the closure renunciation feels earned. Minor drift: “ready to find the living” is stated, not dramatized, blunting the cost edge.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kira’s solitude-as-expedition turn is credible, but the text summarizes rather than dramatizes the moment she pivots from despair to mapping; the “choice” is asserted (“her motivation had crystallized”) rather than rendered as a micro-beat we can watch. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward lyrical self-diagnosis (“alone wasn’t empty”). Still, her body-in-deck actions (charcoal warm on fingers, steady hand across page) keep her grounded, and the final Earned Stasis—continue mapping while millennia slide past—carries visible cost in eternal exile.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Seren’s interior contradiction between obedient apprentice and rule-breaking thief is dramatized in the first 120 words ("calculated yet reckless") and re-embodied in every swap. The embodied cost—ice on lashes, brass burning palm—keeps her from sliding into manifesto. Final renunciation of the pouch of lies is earned because her earlier trembling fingers foreshadow the price of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s shift from paid pretender to obsessive archivist of vanished pawns is visceral and embodied; the contradiction between rehearsed disaster and lived collapse drives every micro-choice. Her “benevolently ruthless” cruelty is shown through exacting gait-coaching that costs both her and survivors real pain, earning the final stance. Interiority stays concrete—smoke taste, marble chill—never sliding into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the colleague’s single-scene challenge, while efficient, slightly underweights relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Isla’s interior contradiction—yearning to forget yet nightly returning to the stone—drives every beat; the feather-touch breakthrough is credibly foreshadowed by her mercury-glass habit. Emotions stay embodied (“cool mercury glass,” “hollow ache”) without label-speak. Final renunciation of exile-identity carries visible cost: she surrenders the safety of forgetting and accepts the pain of memory. Micro-choices (pressing palms, tracing grooves) reveal value hierarchy: memory > pain > erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elena’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are anchored to the chess-hubris backstory, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“I understand that curse intimately”) and the climactic absolution is declared rather than dramatized with contradictory impulse. The micro-choice of plucking the silver thread is crisp; the final confession is coherent but not tested by an opposing impulse, so the change feels asserted, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is concretely textured—her guilt is felt in the canyon’s chill, her defiance in the way she “tests the canyon’s acoustic depths.” The micro-choice to keep walking toward the spire, paint-box in hand, crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth-telling > survival. The contradiction between “innocently mischievous” and a girl’s suicide is held in embodied tension rather than psychologized. Only the final beat of “acceptance of it—whole, sharp, undivided” edges toward explanatory summary, preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her ritual narration under threat, the tactile memory of her grandmother’s lacquer charm, her fingers trembling as acid hisses against brass. Contradictory impulses (terror vs. compulsion to mend) co-exist inside single beats. The final micro-choice—pouring her own grey uncertainty into the statue’s throat—costs her the last illusion of certainty and is earned by every prior match of essence to crater. Only minor gap: we are told “she wished she possessed such certainty” rather than shown a specific physical signature of that lack.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each pockmark-as-template discovery tightens the next action; the acid wave is external coincidence that complicates rather than resolves. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—statue’s golden exhalation re-weights the premise: damage is map, not flaw. Cost is legible in the final image: Mira’s smile of acceptance while the sea calms beneath a dawn that was never there before. Minor hairline: the “centuries-old figure” rule is revealed late, but the pattern is taught in the same beat and immediately tested, so no causality break.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brass hull, acid spray, gear-grind rhythm, and perpetual twilight are filtered through Mira’s alchemical gaze—every sense choice points to corrosion/repair tension. The workshop itself functions as micro-setting: its tilting floor and glowing vials constrain her speed and sequence of placements. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible reaches during the final frantic pour. Acid sea and dawn breakthrough serve as environmental mirror of inner illumination, charging the closing image.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the quilt before the platform sinks—is signaled early and tightened by each successfully matched essence vial. The acid wave arriving at the exact moment of final placement raises physical cost and forecloses retreat; survival now depends on the artifact she is completing. Escalation is driven solely by her agency under pressure; no off-stage rescue. The price is felt: her uncertainty is literally poured away, leaving her in irrevocable openness.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of luminous repair emerges entirely through the statue’s transformation—no explicit sermon. The kintsugi concept is re-priced at closure: the gold is not metal but crystallized human memory, visible in the dawn light. Ambiguity remains—Mira is still uncertain, but that uncertainty is now a vessel, not a wound. The final breathing statue offers a non-literal answer: meaning is the aggregate of breaks, not their erasure.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax compresses under threat—“She removes the first vial...” mimics her own staccato self-narration. Diction stays within alchemical register without drifting into faux-antique. Only micro-slip: “cathedral” wave momentarily breaks idiom, but the image is brief and serves scale.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
    <comment>Rhythmic control mirrors pulse of gears and surf; sentence length varies to accelerate or breathe. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and precise—“grief, blue as drowning” compresses color and fate into three words. High information density: each sentence places a vial, tilts the deck, or charges the statue. Minor register hitch noted above does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—clinging to distance while yearning to dive—are embodied in the cold-water sit that ruins her clothes; the shell’s placement and her soaked jeans externalize the cost of choosing presence over observation. The nostalgic-quay-painter identity is more label than lived-in voice, but the final micro-choice cleanly reverses her twenty-year pattern with visible, wet consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her palm’s worn cork, the garden scent that “hurt so much it came out as violence”—and the apology she whispers at the end is a credible micro-choice that costs her seven years of pride. The contradiction between performed rage and hidden tenderness is embodied rather than diagnosed. Secondary pressure from dying Silas is present but off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is only partly activated; still, the sister-to-sister dynamic under pressure lands. Knowledge stays bounded: Mara never claims to know Vera’s mind, only her own belated recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s grief-rooted drive and improvisational competence are vivid; the bronze censer foot acts as embodied memory and her micro-choice to “press her forehead against the cold window” crystallizes cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment she names her missing daughter feels slightly declarative rather than discovered under fresh pressure, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s solitude, her methodical foraging, and the embodied shame of broadcasting her loneliness are vivid; the micro-choice to press the glass eye to her temple crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The “door closing softly” is a perfect embodied metaphor for regained interiority, and the cost—she will now descend alone again, still storm-scarred—lands with felt weight. Interior contradiction is present but could be sharper under higher pressure; the neighbor’s visit is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the relational crucible. Still, her flawed endurance earns its stasis, and the specificity of truffle scent in damp ravine air keeps her from archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margit’s disciplined, observant nature is convincingly rendered through her “gaps” method and the physical gesture of clutching the boutonnière. The borrowed-memory bleed gives her a credibly destabilizing interior conflict, but the epiphany that “preserved memories aren’t preservation at all” is delivered in abstract shorthand rather than dramatized contradiction, muting the cost of her final release. Still, her choice to drop the flower feels proportionate to her accumulated stance and the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s solitude, tactile map-reading, and inherited promise give him a sharp, specific interiority; the final step-through is earned because we have felt his life-long hesitation in his fingers and his grandfather’s deathbed weight. The micro-choice to insert the chip crystallizes twenty years of refusal. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the conflict is entirely within him, and the cost—leaving the shop of maps for an uncharted path—is legible in the final stride. Flaws (isolation as armor) directly complicate the choice, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid—“disenchantment had settled into her bones like winter cold”—and her refusal to let courtiers accompany her crystallizes agency. The final decision to descend is earned, but the causality between “watching fireflies” and “purpose” is asserted more than dramatized; a sharper micro-choice on the ridge would have lifted her into the 9-band. Still, her flawed sovereignty and embodied fatigue keep her credibly human.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s return-from-capital motive is cleanly anchored; the spiral shell and Kael’s blindness cue her “revalue” pivot. Interiority stays concrete—hand-to-shell, tear-tracks—without label-speak. The final joint stance (“teaching…how to spiral”) costs both their old paths, earned by prior beats. Only minus: no contradictory impulse enacted in scene—she never hesitates to stay—so change feels smooth, not wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to documentation while time dissolves—stays concrete via micro-choices: handwriting loops matching old scrolls, reaching for fresh bark, deciding to keep writing. “Jaded wonder” is performed, not declared, in the eye-roll while gasping. Flaw (compulsive chronicle) complicates every beat and drives the final renunciation of order. Cost is felt: she forecloses the possibility of linear self-coherence, accepting perpetual fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—mourning a lost sense while still performing expertise—remains embodied and specific; her micro-choice to name the screw’s origin triggers the relationship shift with Mr. Chen. The final renunciation (“I haven’t lost anything”) is earned because the screw beat has already literalized transformation of loss into purpose, so the cost feels scaled to the piece. Voice stays individualized; no stock therapy labels. Secondary character (Chen) exerts immediate, relevant pressure and his own stakes are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—shame vs. need to expose scars—collide on the platform; the micro-choice to exhale frost onto the page instead of hiding it crystallizes the arc. Interiority stays concrete: “hands trembling,” “breath wanted to escape but couldn’t,” no therapy-speak. The final renunciation of secrecy is earned because every prior beat links the scars to the rune design; the cost is the perpetual visibility of trauma. Voice remains singular and northern-wind touched throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s compulsion to speak in orchard metaphors while apology-bruised roots the contradiction inside her; the bottle-handling micro-choice (“offering… a physical prayer”) externalizes hierarchy of values with visible cost—she forfeits her protective talisman. Derrick’s refusal to forgive yet admit gladness crystallizes earned stasis without softening his wounds. One minor slip: “imperfect miracles” label surfaces twice in authorial summarizing before it is dramatized, blunting interior contradiction a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s solitary scholar-hermit register is vivid and consistent; his interiority (“he had been trying to understand…while standing apart”) crystallizes the central contradiction. The only flaw is micro-teleology: the final insight feels slightly pre-ordained because we are told he “understood at last” rather than shown the micro-moments that tip him. Still, the embodied cost—laying down the dictionary as marker—lands as visible forfeiture, satisfying the earned-stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—longing to quantify time yet sensing its immeasence—remains vivid and embodied; the key’s cold weight against her sternum externalizes it. Micro-choice of inserting the “useless” heirloom key into the hidden slot crystallizes her gamble. Final renunciation of counting feels earned because the scene has dramatized measurement as a human cage. Cost is quiet but legible: she forfeits the certainty her post once supplied.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s spatial gift and grief-hardened vigilance are shown through laser-tracked air currents and the quiet calculus of breach points; the contradiction between her rule-bound job and her empathy for Marcus is embodied, not declared. The final choice—to open the farm rather than prosecute—pays off an earlier causal seed: her own recovery via relationship, not isolation. Interiority stays concrete (“seeing James everywhere… in the negative space where he should have been”) and avoids therapy-speak. Only the moment of recognition with Marcus edges toward tidy symmetry, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—intellectual scorn for her father’s gambling yet emotional compulsion to finish his cipher—are dramatized in the notebook scene and the decision to co-author recovery. The final micro-choice (packing lantern & notebooks to visit him) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she accepts the same “uncalculable” wager he once did, inheriting risk rather than merely critiquing it. Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. One hairline slip: “wanted to widen perspectives responsibly” is stated motive, not embodied; keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iris’s interiority is concrete—her ritual of wetting the finger, the pad of notes, the bootleg electric bill—yet her contradictory impulse (cultivating distance to enable reunion) is asserted more than dramatized in scene. The final smile is a micro-choice, but the cost of her nightly labor feels conceptual rather than embodied; we see no fatigue, doubt, or personal price. Secondary callers are sketched with swift particularity, but their pressure on Iris is vicarious, keeping her arc slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to others’ memories while fleeing her own—are dramatized in the thermos-opening beat; the locket’s arrival forces a visible micro-choice (kneel, ink, write) that costs her detachment. Interiority stays embodied (“fingers trembling,” “air tasted of salt and sweetness”) and avoids label-speak. The final covenant shift is earned because the beat sequence shows her prior mechanical method becoming untenable once Maya’s face re-enters the frame. Cap at 8.7: no second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets remain N/A and the cost, while felt, is not compounded by interpersonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid—her brittle laugh, the tactile moon rock, the micro-choice to drop the mask with the stranger—yet the “cure for loneliness” is named too diagnostically in the penultimate paragraph, a fleeting slip into label-speak that keeps her from the 9-band. The young man’s parallel ache is sketched just enough to catalyze her shift without hogging focus. Relationship crucible barely present, but at this length the solo-plus-catalyst structure is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—grief mapped as topography, dowsing as movement. Contradictory drives (hunger for stillness vs. fear of feeling) coexist in-scene, not summarized. The final stillpoint is earned by the preceding tactile trail; cost is the completed melody that both wounds and steadies her. No diagnostic labels, no stock phrasing; every beat is skin-level.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the Meridian seeds and her addiction to quantum uncertainty—play out in embodied beats: she physically tests the pen against the console, fingers the split nib, rewrites the data. Her micro-choice to send all seven contingent histories at once crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth-as-multiplicity over single-score success. The cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of one “right” answer and accepts permanent professional ambiguity. Interiority avoids label-speak; “confidently uncertain” is shown through repeated on-page wagers, not self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—mourning lost sound while discovering new rhythms—are embodied in her trembling grip on the filmless camera and the tears that catch moonlight. The final renunciation of needing to be remembered is earned by the dock-side choreography that turns the harbor into an instrument; the cost is legible in her salty cheeks and the camera left on the planks. Celeste’s quietly charismatic status is shown, not told: her murmuring hands draw Marina back from the edge twice, and her refusal to vocalize maintains the power asymmetry. Micro-choices—framing ripples, adjusting an aperture that will never click—reveal a hierarchy that values witnessing over recording.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. incendiary sabotage—surface only in summary; the archive beats show single-minded purpose, flattening internal tension. The tender final gesture is credible because the tapestry fragment has been carried, fingered, and finally clutched to chest, giving the endurance visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s quietly rebellious trait is shown through her forbidden visit and obsessive drumming; her interiority is sensory and specific ("sound waves bloom like flowers, like ghosts, like her grandmother’s hands"). The braided memories create a credible layered self, yet the 13-in-1 chorus stays observational—no single memory forces a micro-choice that changes her next move. The ending’s "she would return tomorrow" is an endurance stance, but the cost feels assumed rather than freshly paid on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s contradictory motives—union-justice hunger vs. self-protective caginess—collide live in scene: her whisper-campaign, tablet swipe refusal, and final solo fade-out all flow from the same Gemini duality promised by the coin. Flaws (overconfidence, instrumental ethics) drive every beat and foreclose alliance with Voss; cost is visible when she sacrifices immediate leverage to keep the coin warm in her palm. Interiority is embodied (grip, storm-hum, harness tug) rather than labeled. Single POV stays tight; no status crucible needed because Voss functions as institutional mirror, not relationship, and that suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s guilt, silence, and eventual confession are kinesthetic and embodied; her throat-stone and the act of running to the harbor master crystallize cost. The guardian’s still-water eyes and mirrored choreography externalize motive without slipping into expositional interiority. Interior contradiction—wanting absolution yet fearing voice—drives her micro-choice to place her own mirror at the end, earning the Earned Stasis coda. Only lapse: the brother’s off-page rescue is heard, not paid for in visible consequence to her body/stance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s “hearing the unsaid” is dramatized early and repaid at the end when the children’s new questions audibly surface. Interiority stays concrete (“cradled each child’s courage”) and her quiet rebellion is rooted in eleven years of observed erosion. The final micro-choice—leaving the impossible position on the board—embodies cost without speech. Slight reserve from top band: we never feel her own fear of failure, only the children’s.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—ex-dancer brawler turned gentle cargo-hauler—are dramatized in her body (the impossible grace, the kelp-brushing toes) and in the micro-choice to cradle then release the scrimshaw. The internal split between violent heritage and tender self-image is embodied, not labeled. What keeps this from 9+ is that the renunciation beat is slightly over-articulated (“I was never meant to be a weapon”) rather than left to the gesture and whale-song; the cost is felt but not given a persistent constraint that will shape tomorrow’s dock work.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—narrating detachment while hinting self-harm—are vivid, embodied, and track her slow refusal to perform feeling. “She cultivates lightness” fused with the driftwood’s near-disintegration makes the renunciation legible. Moral ambiguity is dramatized, not labeled, and the final silence carries felt cost. Voice cadence never slips; interiority stays knife-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lyrical but stays abstract—“tremor of certainty” named, not embodied. One micro-choice—paraphrasing the old text—decides the climax; stakes feel interior rather than endangering. Still, the shift from obedient reader to boundary-dissolver is legible and earned by her repeated, escalating translations.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” trait are shown through concrete bargaining and plant-messaging, not labels; her interiority is textured and drives every beat. Fen’s sleepwalking stagnation and final micro-choice to fetch the “failed” vase are believable, but his emotional shift feels compressed—one silent look at paintings and he pivots. The barter pact lands with mutual cost (her time, his lifetime habit), satisfying earned change. Still, the relationship crucible is under-pressed: status barely tilts, and Fen’s voice never fully separates from Mira’s poetic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Karim’s shift from detached curator to invested co-creator is embodied in micro-choices (nodding against judgment, staying up all night). The bell ringer’s “powerfully gentle” trait is shown—fingers dancing on unfamiliar gear, shoulder touch that crystallizes alliance—never labeled in interior monologue. Interior contradiction surfaces when Karim whispers “What are you doing?” even as she surrenders controls: curiosity wars with grief. Their joint renunciation of “perfect destinations” costs her the safety of scientific detachment, felt when the lab “finally hums with purpose” under dawn light.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradiction-rich: ash-black fingers, need to “teach withering to bloom,” simultaneous fear that transformation equals betrayal. Every micro-choice—heating silver, folding second origami—exposes the hierarchy of values and carries visible cost. The final renunciation of her old grief is earned by the causal chain of commissions that force her to practice what she sells. Voice stays individual, never drifts into therapeutic gloss; the flaw (addiction to beautiful stasis) drives the quiet climax.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is precise—her urge to confess after months of resistance is embodied in the brush-rolling rosary of the measuring tape. The contradictory pull between mystical inheritance and mechanical analysis is held in simultaneous tension, not alternated. The final choice—to keep mapping the next crash—carries inherited cost: she forfeits the grandmother’s deathbed request to “leave the pattern alone,” a price legible in the rain-lit skylight’s fracture. Only the slightest safety-hedge (“maybe just prove…”) keeps this from a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maressa’s interiority is concrete and character-specific: the trembling hands, the saffron veil pulled tighter, the refusal to record anything—each micro-choice embodies her contradictory hunger for and terror of knowledge. The final renunciation is earned by the prior cascade of crystallized memories that force her to value unfiltered impermanence; the cost is visible as she walks away carrying only unspoken understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s quiet refusal to surrender the stone and her micro-choice of pressing it to the glass embody a credible, scaled endurance. The seventeen-year tenure and the stone’s weight anchor contradictory impulses—archival complicity vs. terrestrial loyalty—without therapeutic self-labeling. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through her professional gaze and tactile ritual. The final image crystallizes her values hierarchy: the fading condensation mark costs her nothing and everything, earning the stoic stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—gentle caretaker vs. complicit academic—is embodied in the notebook beats and the arm-grip moment with Prism. The final renunciation (resignation + independent application) is causally earned by the reflective sequence and carries visible professional cost. Still, the epiphany is slightly over-articulated (“true compassion required strength”) and the self-forgiveness feels a touch therapeutic, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her guilt over the botched miracle and the plant telepathy are embodied rather than labeled—but her change feels externally narrated (“Her hands warmed”) rather than dramatized in a decisive micro-choice. The “grief-and-gift” contradiction is present but never collides on the page; the scar-palm moment is summary, not a charged beat. We witness her realization, not the internal hinge that irreversibly reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—yearning to witness love yet fearing its weight—surfaces early and drives every tactile choice, but the final renunciation feels slightly under-causal; we’re told “she understood” rather than watching the micro-moments that tip her from collector to transmitter. Still, her embodied reactions to the celluloid (palms stinging, throat humming) keep emotion specific and non-diagnostic. The flaw that keeps her from 8+ territory: the climactic decision to thread and project arrives without a visible, on-page trade-off or new risk that makes the cost bite.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and consistent—her madness manifests as tactile aurora pulses and astrolabe clicks. The contradictory impulses (fear of overload vs. irrepressible conduit) coexist in-scene, driving the final renunciation. Micro-choices (palm on granite, fingers tracing meteors, mouth opening to speak) reveal value hierarchy: world-creation > self-preservation. Cost is felt: she “cannot hold it all” yet yields her body as archway—Earned Stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dreamless freight guard’s interior contradiction—simultaneous everywhere-presence and singularity—remains embodied in every beat; her fractured lullaby and the micro-choice to press the chess-clock button collapse a wave-function and cost her a version of herself, satisfying the 9+ test. No stock phrasing; emotion is shown through phosphorescent dune-blooms and amber-frozen midnight, not labels. The only hairline slip is “she could feel the knowledge bleeding” which edges toward diagnostic abstraction, but it is instantly re-grounded in quantum-foam tactility.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his body registers the gear’s warmth, the hum in his sternum—but the “stray philosopher” label is never tested by an external mind; he wanders alone, so status, relationship, and contradiction stay theoretical. The final smile is earned by the on-page gear-work, yet the cost is only conceptual (“wilderness he’d forgotten”) rather than a concrete forfeiture we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya’s interiority is textured—grief embodied as “sudden weightlessness,” micro-choices like accepting the punch—but the guides remain functional archetypes; their “quiet wisdom” is stated, not dramatized, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final renunciation is credible because the vigil years are shown first, yet the moment of handing over the punch feels externally bestowed rather than wrested from contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marta’s damaged hands and growing compulsion to sing feel embodied; the ash-note marks force her to act. The “seraphically mundane” label is asserted, not dramatized, so the full 9+ gate fails. Yet her quiet refusal to leave and the bolt-on-step gesture crystallize a credible, cost-bearing stance. Interiority stays sparse but consistent; the pacing of restored sensation parallels her decision to reclaim sound, earning the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s ageless vigilance and miniature scale are shown through tactile ritual (grinding ink, touching scrolls) that externalizes her regal humility; the final fade into memory crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—her “careful hand,” the library’s last exhale—never slipping into label-speak. The only limit: we glimpse contradictory impulses (guardian vs. saboteur) but they are asserted more than dramatized in a single beat, keeping her short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s compulsive tapping and scientist’s vigil are concrete and particular; the knot of grief-professional duty feels lived-in. Interiority stays anchored to sensory cues (rail, desk, glass) rather than abstract labels. The final renunciation—abandoning the modern current map for the atlas—carries credible cost because we’ve watched her fingers drum out the old tidal code all along. Micro-choices (pulling the page to the light, taping it to the window) enact the shift, earning the quiet epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s barefoot ritual and opera-glass habit sketch a consistent, idiosyncratic mind, but her interiority drifts into generic reflection (“righteousness without direction was just noise”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The decision to “gather the others here at twilight” is credible yet lacks a visible, page-cost—she risks nothing concrete tonight. Earned stasis is implied, not dramatized; the hum’s peace substitutes for personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory blend of warrior-gardener is vivid in her embodied climb and the memory-gun/kite-gesture beat. The “accidentally telepathic” trait is dramatized through micro-choices (three days by the springs, mouth-cracking syllables) rather than label-speak. Her final “yes” is earned by the causal chain of insurgent → midwife, with the cost of a foreclosed violent path legible in the steam. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally drifts toward thematic summary (“evolution with intent”), softening the contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Layla’s embodied freeze–thaw cycle is persuasive: the lavender cutting set-down and palm-flat-against-glass micro-choice anchor her survival calculus. The photograph handled twice provides externalized contradiction without slipping into label-speak. Yet the interiority edges toward therapeutic summary (“the body keeps score”) and the renunciation is more atmospheric than tactically paid; the cost is felt but not foreclosed with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—wanting to see whole yet compulsively fragmenting—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice dramatizes the shift from refusal to acceptance. The final “smile” is earned by image, not by a prior on-page decision that costs her anything concrete. Still, her perceptual drift is consistent and the arc lands credibly under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “calm fury,” “consciously wild grace,” and predator metaphors create a consistent perceptual signature. The brother flashback is embedded early and directly shapes her present micro-choice to study the ink, satisfying BRR. The final renunciation—she will wait for the next eclipse and risk disappearance—carries visible cost (“she would disappear too, eventually”) and is foreshadowed by her prior tracking obsession. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is evocative—guilt, filial piety, archival obsession braid believably—but the “activation core” appears as a pocketed talisman rather than a tool earned or fought for, muting the sense of flaw-driven mistake. Her contradictory fear/need is declared (“bravely conflicted”) more than dramatized in mid-action; we’re told she trembles but see no fumbling mis-choice that would cost her before the climax. The final decision crystallizes legacy pressure, yet the beat lands lightly because earlier micro-choices never backfire, so renunciation feels pre-ordained, not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—killer’s daughter turned rose-weaver—grounds every beat; the father’s scarred hands performing gentleness under her instruction crystallizes the earned change. Micro-choices (canvas pressed, blossom opened, blade sheathed) carry visible cost and re-weight their relationship without therapy-speak. Only the father’s motivation for arriving “world gone madder” is declared, not dramatized, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s cool-headedness is shown through action—she steers toward cosmic dissonance “the way a shark follows blood”—but her interiority stays general; we’re told she’s “cool-headed even when the universe decided to unravel” rather than shown the specific embodied tension that contradicts that calm. The contradiction between her fisherman’s composure and the parental desperation that drives her is asserted, not dramatized in a single visible micro-choice until the final catch; earlier beats summarize her state. Still, her motive—transmuting grief into a cure for her daughter’s silence—remains legible and consistent, and the final “Mother?” lands as earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Adelaide’s interiority is vivid and specific—her “orbit of regret” and telescope-dome metaphors give her a distinct perceptual signature. The contradictory impulse to protect vs. expose her grandfather is dramatized in two beats: pocketing the nib as relic, then re-purposing it as evidence. Micro-choices (whispering “assume,” descending the stairs) embody the shift. The final renunciation carries visible cost—family credibility sacrificed for truth—earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s guilt-born drive to “translate” lost sound into re-connection is concrete; her micro-choice to crack the amber and tattoo her arm with its dust embodies the cost. Interiority is lyric yet specific—ink “the color of nebulae,” the firefly as “promise that light could survive entrapment.” Contradictory impulses (flight vs. self-tethering) compress into one visible act, earning resonance without therapy-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the mother remains off-page, so relational crucible pressure is implied rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Isla’s interiority is vivid—her shift from sidewalk whimsy to mandala-maker is embodied through the damp stone under her knees and the warm tile in her palm. The micro-choice to place the fragment crystallizes her value hierarchy: meaning over certainty, shared grief over solitary art. The mother’s arrival feels inevitable rather than convenient because Isla’s practiced social perception (reading grief in posture) triggers the invitation. Cost is palpable: the mandala’s “gaps” now include the daughter-shaped absence that can’t be filled, only honored.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vessa’s motive—mercy that costs truth—holds across every beat; the steel-hands/sparrow-egg contradiction is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation (pocketing the tessera) is the direct culminative payoff of her augmented gentleness and her commander’s guilt. No interior label-speak; the emotional arithmetic stays messy and embodied. Micro-choices (kneeling, prying, pocketing) visibly enact the hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Celeste’s contradictory drives—applause hunger vs. post-death acceptance—are dramatized in her choice to sing, risking eternal exposure for one last performance. The embodied synesthetic flare (“silver hummed with hope”) shows her perception under pressure and justifies why the coin’s touch catalyzes action. Her interiority stays ghost-specific (translucent palm, drifting) without的诊断标签. Her final renunciation—accepting an encore of changed life rather than ovation—carries visible cost as she cools into orchard solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s skepticism-turned-devotion is credibly embodied (checking fever though it’s useless; static-jump into Iris). Interior contradiction—warning Iris yet risking electrocution to re-open the pathways—drives every beat. The final camera lift is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy: love + witness > cure. Minor: Iris’s interior is delivered second-hand, softening the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her fossil-touching ritual and sensory-mapping vocation feel lived-in. The “becoming voice of the unknown” motive, however, is declared more than dramatized; we see no micro-choice that risks or costs her anything on-page. The elm leaf reprise supplies a tactile tether, yet the climactic shift from observer to translator is asserted, not embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific enough to carry the lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s quietly inspired sorting compels every choice; her interiority stays concrete in amber light and button tactility. Interior contradiction is present—duty to prophecy vs hunger for agency—but the shift from obedient keeper to active interpreter is shown only in summary, not under live opposition, so the final smile feels slightly un-scuffed. Still, the ledger micro-choices visibly foreclose her old life, paying a felt cost. Voice remains singular, occupation-specific, emotionally embodied; no head-hop or label-speak.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: jar discovery → button sorting → echo unscrambling → public debunking; each beat changes her tactical options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy re-weights from cage to call, with on-page conceptual cost—her past life cannot be re-lived. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no spatial drift. One soft spot: the “fourth day” leap compresses likely friction with townsfolk into a single declarative paragraph; because causality holds elsewhere, only a −0.2 nudge.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, cliff walls, and dust motes filter every action; shelves dictate movement, canyon wind times the finale. Buttons function as micro-setting—each tray is a station that channels her fingers and thought pattern. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s professional gaze: touch of wood, hush of sand, filtered light. Environmental mirroring is implicit, never declared; no static cataloging.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the prophecy own her?”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when unscrambling reveals healing, not doom. Agency is intellectual, not physical: each sorted button narrows interpretive options until only public truth-telling remains; this choice costs her anonymity and former identity. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and social. Cost is legible: “choices unmade, paths forbidden” are acknowledged on-page before the smile.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not lecture: lost fasteners = lost nuance in retold stories. Subtext lives in silence—gaps between voices in the jar, empty button threads. Final image of sand “opening” rather than “falling” reweights time itself, offering a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing paragraph; ambiguity lingers about how townsfolk will now use the truth.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter: “amber whisper,” “canyon echo hum,” syntax contracts under pressure—“She set the jar down and returned…” Rhythm mirrors her methodical caretaker rhythm; no POV slippage. Diction is concrete, within her plausible lexicon. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests in narrative texture, which remains consistent and purposeful.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information is dense—one line can layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Figurative language is restrained, never stacked; no mixed metaphors. Occasional near-repetition of “button” and “echo” is pattern-taught and pays off in closure, so permitted. Opening and closing images are sharp and propulsive; no scaffold or paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete—her recognition that “disappearing wasn’t the same as healing” crystallizes micro-choice under pressure. Contradictory impulses (stay hidden vs. finish the mission) coexist in-scene, not summary. The final stance shift is earned: eighteen months of snow-watch convert to active re-entry, cost signaled by leaving the bluff’s safety. Voice remains individual, though a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“cowardice by prettier names”) nicks perfect credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    The coachman’s thirty-year vigil and ambient awareness of the river give him weighted presence; his micro-choices (waiting, speaking, turning back) visibly cost him time and keep the ferry from leaving early, anchoring causality. The woman’s shift from clutching documents to holding the needle is embodied and stakes-driven, though her interiority edges toward tidy epiphany in the final paragraph. Interior contradiction is present but soft—no real risk of failure is entertained—so the arc feels more illustrative than crucible-forged. Still, both characters read as individuals, not types, and the shared recognition scene lands with earned, quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    The potter’s calm, observant interiority is vivid and consistent; her micro-choices (speaking to trees, placing the glass, leaving part of herself) dramatize the earned insight. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the internal conflict is only implied, capping the score below 8.8. The final “leaving something behind” is a gentle renunciation, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her pragmatic acceptance of the rose’s death, the talismanic weight of the brass tooth, her lock-picking credo translated into social action—yet the cast of twelve children blurs into a chorus; no individual child exerts pressure or challenges her, so the relationship crucible remains cool. The promised “stop hiding” moment is dramatized as communal light-beaming, a credible renunciation of solitude, but the cost (tomorrow’s consequences) is only projected, not tasted. Micro-choices (row cadence, flashlight angles) reveal values, but the emotional plateau stays level; we witness no contradictory impulse mid-scene. Still, the arc from private grief to collective agency is legible and earned, satisfying the 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—“brittle awakenings” and “breaking bones to reset them” give us embodied stakes—but her arc tilts toward thematic statement rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her on the page. The final stance is clear, yet the beat that locks it in is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is felt abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei Lin’s renunciation of her archive is earned: eleven years of hoarding letters flips to active release when the spiral re-weights her identity. The ache-typology (“longing, regret, hope deferred”) risks label-speak, but the embodied moment of tying each letter offsets it. Jun’s parallel arc is slighter—his decision to write his own letter is declared, not dramatized—so the full 9+ gate stays shut.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her teeth ache, her vision blurs—and her micro-choice to weaponize the campus station feels earned by her private naming of “cosmic tricksters.” The cautious hope trait actually constrains her timing and risk calculus, showing contradictory impulses (dread vs. defiance) in scene. No other character steps onstage, so status dynamics aren’t tested, but her competence is nicely balanced by the untested math that could “amplify the tricksters’ power,” a tangible flaw. The ending’s steadiness—marking the victory “with steady hands”—pays a visible cost for her endurance, qualifying as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is vividly embodied (“breathing through the tight bands”) and directly complicates her descent; the micro-choice to kneel and press stone while panic screams is credible. The interior contradiction—fear versus the need to stay—drives every beat. The “wistful rebellion” close is earned because her endurance has visibly cost her (shaking legs, gasping). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; headcount stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s prosopagnosia and portraitist eye create a sharp, contradiction-rich interior that fuels every beat; the final decision to paint the killer’s absence is fully earned. Micro-choices—gloved hand on ribbon, trembling pad—embody her methodical nature under pressure. The lone flaw: “understanding lanced” moment veers toward diagnostic self-label, slightly cooling embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s inherited mission is clear, but her interiority stays general; “generations of inherited frustration” is told, not embodied. The copper nail momentarily externalizes resolve, yet no contradictory impulse or micro-choice undercuts her, so pressure never tests her idealism. Dr. Yoon’s shift from fatalism to collaboration is credible because the formulae visibly pierce his apathy, giving the beat sufficient cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maria’s “dynamically observant” trait is asserted more than dramatized; only one micro-choice (climbing down to read the wrap) is shown, so the interior contradiction/test under pressure is thin. The final decision to bear witness through song is credible but cost is asserted, not embodied. Still, her perceptual specificity and the embodied fiddle keep her above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Luka’s interior contradiction—embezzler’s pride versus self-disgust—remains concrete through body (polished calm trembling at the fox), micro-choice (placing stones to trap himself), and embodied cost (sitting in dust that coats his tailored past). Yet the “perceptively calm” label is used twice without fresh embodiment; the beat where he spreads the loot-bills on velvet could have delivered one more sensory fracture to hit 8-plus.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—dream-worker drawn to hard science—surfaces early and powers the final collaboration, but the “healing voice” is asserted more than dramatized. Kove’s guilt is concrete in the telegram scene; his micro-choice to stay and share data earns the shift. No stock labels, emotions stay body-anchored. The cost—Chen’s death, their joint years ahead—is felt, though Mira’s flaw-to-action chain could be one beat tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s “warlike serenity” and the cost of “unguarding” herself are viscerally embodied; her decision to feed the seed to the tree crystallizes her contradictory drives—guardian and self-sacrificing searcher. The interior contradiction—needing to lose herself to find truth—propels every beat. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent, but micro-choice under pressure (pressing seed, hearing confession) is clean. Flawed competence balanced: she expects the charlatan’s failure, yet still endures the same lake that swallowed him.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority—the “anxious elation,” the memory of being dismissed as “purposefully curious”—is concrete and embodied. The scar-link with Chen crystallizes her drive and supplies a visible cost. The final renunciation (“we were never meant to stop the future”) is causally seeded. Minor slip: “root-bound visionary” is label-only until the final paragraph; still, contradiction and micro-choice are present under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—her “reckless idealism” versus the fresh knowledge that her trades scar the fabric of fate—drives every beat once Kael confronts her. The moment she fingers the burned Tower card, her body trembles and later she “calculates” the root-web, showing embodied, conflicted agency rather than abstract guilt. Kael’s demand forces her to a micro-choice—try the impossible reversal—whose cost is legible in the final line “ready to unmake what never should have been made,” an earned endurance that forecloses her former certainty. Dialogue carries distinct status shift: her whispered “I only wanted to help” against his corrected “You saved a life” crystallizes power transfer under the orchard’s glow.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—needing facts yet craving narrative redemption—drives every beat; the micro-choice to tack the cloth above his certificates crystallizes the arc with visible cost. The woman’s tremor under “My father never lied” pressures him, but her off-page exit leaves the relationship crucible half-forged, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Asha’s interiority is textured—“She was nothing if not patient” shows a lived trait—but “kindly methodical” is asserted more than embodied. The seed-reprieve is a single micro-choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. Closure is acceptance rather than costly renunciation, so the change feels gently accumulative, not scaldingly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to order while feeding books to a tide-basin furnace—remains embodied and specific; the moment she straps the scroll into the creel, her pulse syncs with gear cogs, showing cost without label-speak. The only drag is that the grandmother is invoked more as mythic backstory than as a lived relationship that pressures present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—“I forgot how to feel until I found proof that others did” is a sharp, embodied turn—but her professional training never once complicates or resists the ritual; the inspector persona is announced yet never exerts pressure, so the final self-crowning feels pre-approved rather than earned through flaw or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s guilt-driven compulsion to chronicle rivers is credibly embodied, but the brother’s death and her complicity are revealed in a single reflective block that tells rather than dramatizes the decisive trauma; the micro-choice to play the accordion is lovely yet arrives after a long interior summary, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s curiosity, guilt-haunted secrecy, and growing conviction that she must risk madness to map silence give her a sharp, specific spine. The backward-ticking watch externalizes her willingness to gamble with time and memory, while her masked face literalizes the cost of witness. She acts: she climbs, writes, decides to stay—each beat tightening the noose of obsession. The final smile behind the veil crystallizes her acceptance of perpetual precarity, a credible renunciation that the text has steadily earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iris’s contradictory drives—authenticate vs liberate—are alive in every beat; the fern-whispers and coffee-cup futures give her interiority a sharp, idiosyncratic edge. The micro-choice to sketch the blueprint is the explicit pivot where her values crystallize and exile becomes legible cost. Only the Empire’s favour is stated more than shown, muting the scale of temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s double vocation is never used to create friction or choice; she moves through the ritual without interior contradiction or visible cost. The lucid-watchful trait is named but never complicates her perception or forces a micro-error. Because no secondary character appears, status/relationship crucible bullets are N/A; the lone weakness is that her motive—capture the spark—never meets an on-page obstacle or sacrifice, so the endurance feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s interiority is concrete—hairpin touch anchors memory without label-speak; forgiveness is shown via micro-choice (offering him the Path) not speech. The “kindly decisive” trait is dramatized when she immediately steers the killer-soul after personal shock. Cost is felt: handing over the hairpin knowledge breaches her private wound yet completes her purpose. One beat of contradictory impulse (hand tremble on hairpin) would have lifted this to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “conscience-for-hire” label is vivid, but her interiority drifts into tidy aphorism (“doubt isn’t a burden…”) rather than embodied contradiction. Keegan’s collapse is credibly raw, yet the double-fee motive never exerts new pressure; their power shift is legible but not costly to her. The earned beat is Keegan’s surrender, not hers, so the arc feels half-resided-in.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maia’s interiority is concrete—she “breathed shallow in the sycamore hush,” feels the trance loosen her perception, and drops her own stone as a deliberate micro-choice that signals her re-priced stance. Keiran’s backwards-aging body is a living cost, but because he is a mentor figure, his decisions are mostly off-page exposition; the visible alteration of his physique supplies the embodied price that compensates for his limited on-stage agency. The teacher/student status crucible is present yet static—no power shift occurs—so the relationship beats serve as thematic echo rather than character-forcing pressure. Closure still lands cleanly under Maia’s earned shift, so the minor mentor-agency gap caps rather than breaks the score.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skimmer’s centuries-long stillness is dramatized through micro-choices—waiting, listening, humming—that externalize her discipline; the contradiction between ossified body and roaming consciousness is embodied every paragraph. The hunter-pulse’s shift from frantic loop to spacious wandering is shown, not labeled, and the final quiet arrowhead proves the cost of her teaching. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, so the arc is strictly interior, yet it earns its renunciation-stasis. Interiority stays concrete—“she felt something else: a pulse left wandering”—avoiding diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Teryn’s interior contradiction—clinging to “inefficient” hand-drawn sigils while failing algorithmic exams—drives every beat; the moment she unstraps the keystone and feels its accommodating pulse, her choice to climb is already legible. Micro-choices (strapping, unstrapping, palm-press) embody her hierarchy of values and foreclose the Academy path with felt cost. The glow that “remembers” literalizes her flaw and final proof, earning the quiet epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in muscle burn and mist-acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s grief-driven obsession is concrete—every beat (archives, dive, journal opening) is filtered through synesthetic fragments he can’t fully access. The inherited synesthesia is shown, not labeled, and the brass key as “lodestone” externalizes pull without cliché. Final endurance—returning to the lamps, now seeing amber sound—earns its cost: he gives up solving the mystery and accepts witness. Interior contradiction is light; mother remains idealized, so the arc flirts with one-note, capping below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority is textured—her palm-weighing of coins, the hush-whisper “Show me which frequency”—and her final renunciation of certainty is earned through iterated micro-choices. The “quietly enthusiastic” trait stays embodied rather than labeled. A hairline slip: “stellar doubt gnawed” is slightly diagnostic; tightening that line would hit 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s grief is palpably embodied—tracing the atlas, naming monsters with the blade—yet the interior contradiction between duty and loss is stated more than enacted. The micro-choice to speak the sea-monsters’ true names is sharp, but the sudden leap to universal reaper-wisdom (“she understood why reapers existed”) feels unearned, flattening the arc. Daughter remains off-stage voice, so relationship crucible is implied, not pressured. Still, the earned cost is visible: crystallized grief in pocket, voice echoing, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and particular—“lukewarm” magic is never abstract label but shows up as failed ignition and dew-counting obsession. Contradictory impulses—brittle self-doubt vs stubborn belief—play out in the same beats, not alternating summaries. The final act of ringing feels inevitable because her month of micro-choices (timing drops, clay-clapper reconstruction) has already foreclosed retreat; cost is visible when she stands “holding her broken bell” while water returns, her power still feeble. Flaw is balanced with struggle: naïveté is not cured, it is the very instrument of success, earning an Earned Stasis that legitimately accepts permanent vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her grandfather’s silence, her choice to scan and leak the report—and the final stance costs her the supervisor’s approval. The precisely humane trait surfaces once (p.5: “precisely humane expression”) but never steers an on-page choice, so the trait remains ornamental rather than crucible. Still, her refusal to file the hazard report and the wind-chime restoration image crystallize an earned renunciation with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction is present—logic vs. intuition—but the shift from denial to acceptance is declared (“Understanding struck her like lightning”) rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible right there on the page; the sentimental trait is shown via keepsakes yet never forces a costly decision, so the arc feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—wanting to flee yet choosing to teach—grounds every beat; the parachute-buckle tic embodies it. The moment she releases the buckle is a micro-choice that costs her the fantasy of escape and locks her into transparency with the valley. Muscle-memory traversal of the arbor shows embodied knowledge undercutting intellectual doubt. Emotional layering is concrete, never diagnostic; her final stance feels earned, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kenji’s numbness and slow reawakening are rendered through embodied tremors and tearing eyes rather than labels; the moment he names his clone “brother” the interior contradiction resolves with visible cost. Micro-choices—flinching at the jar, voice shaking in court—track a believable hierarchy of values under pressure. The only drag is a touch of therapy-speak (“ego death,” “complement”) that slightly flattens the peak beat; still, the arc from dissociation to felt paradox feels earned and specific to this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Miranda’s motives are sketched—save the indie escape room—but her interiority stays generic (“heavy with possibility,” “understanding that she had found her answer”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the corpse-flower success feels gifted, not wrested. The final choice to refuse buyouts is declared, not paid for with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s “mournfully eager” gait is viscerally embodied in the trembling pull-cord hand; the contradiction between grief and manic hope drives every beat. His seven-year tenure and acoustic experiments are economically anchored to the tunnel’s stone, making the leaf-blower ritual feel inevitable rather than quirky. The micro-choice to scatter actual oak/maple leaves (not just “leaves”) concretizes his private theology of sound. Closure’s cost is understated but legible: he forfeits silence and accepts the role of underground troubadour of grief—an Earned Stasis that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guardian’s slow surrender to feral embodiment, then her regained upright stance after donning the pendant, gives two credible micro-choices that re-weight her identity; dimensional homesickness is embodied (ice in hair, ache in chest) rather than labelled. Interior contradiction—human reason vs fox-like crawl—remains visible throughout, peaking as she internalizes the garden’s wrongness. The cost is felt: she forfeits certainty, accepts permanent boundary-state exile, and this renunciation is causally seeded by earlier failures to remember systems. Voice occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing (“interiorizing exteriors”) that edges on therapy-speak, keeping it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—master-pleasing apprentice vs self-authoring alchemist—drives every beat; her final renunciation of the Royal Metallurgist post is foreshadowed in her tactile hatred of “safe and soulless” coin-work. Embodied emotion is sharp: fingers “forgot the feel of anything but gold,” shoulders tense as she “clutches” the snapped crozier. Micro-choices under pressure—kneeling, singing the eighteen “failed” formulas, plunging the staff—trace a visible value hierarchy: knowledge > status > survival. The earned cost is the forfeiture of a secure destiny, shown in the ember-nexus heart-beat that mirrors her own and the living staff she must now carry into exile.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her fingers tasting static, her refusal to leave the dead city—but her contradiction (clinging to endings as beginnings) is stated more than dramatized. The decisive shift to “listening to silence” is prepared yet feels slightly teleological; the cost of abandoning old methods is named, not embodied. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the final renunciation carries credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through daily ritual (turning the empty hourglass) and active listening to the radio; his interiority stays concrete (“memorizing their faces, learning their stories”). The final choice—broadcasting passenger names in pattern—grows directly from these habits, paying a visible cost in three lost years. No internal contradiction is dramatized in-scene, and Captain Reeves remains a translucent accessory rather than a crucible, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her calm methodical movements against the brother-loss ache—but the “texture of connection” quest is declared more than dramatized; no contradictory micro-choice on the final tying-off beat, so the renunciation feels slightly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Yael’s interior contradiction—clinging to iron-dead-reckoning while craving starlit transcendence—drives every beat; the chain-link palmed, weighed, relinquished, and handed off acts as embodied micro-choice that forecloses her remaining “stay down” option with visible cost. The final image crystallizes that renunciation: she will surface, lose three thousand meters of safety, and pay in isolation to master a vanished art. Reeves functions mainly as echo-board, so status dynamics are thin; still, her single trait (“balancedly curious”) is repeatedly pressure-tested rather than merely labeled. Voice stays coherent and occupation-rooted throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s “persistently curious” trait is repeatedly named but never dramatized through risky trade-offs or visible cost; her interiority is vivid (“chest tighten”) yet stays aligned with a single emotional register. The final beat—realising the call is a warning—rings as a knowledge leap rather than a contradictory impulse acted out. Because no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path for her (she simply phones authorities), the earned-change bar for 9+ isn’t cleared. Still, her perceptual signature holds, and the young voice’s vulnerability tightens her mission credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Claustrophobia is shown through throat-closing and narrowing vision, but the interiority drifts into abstract “weight she felt in her bones” rather than body-specific immediacy. The contradiction—spelunker afraid of enclosed spaces—remains stated, never exploited for a beat where her skill actually worsens her panic. Micro-choices (sealing the pack, powering the station) are present yet feel functional, not value-hierarchy exposing. Closure cost is conceptual rather than embodied; the earned stasis is clean but the physical price of returning to terror is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marcus’s post-mortem counting tic is concrete and idiosyncratic, anchoring interiority; the porcelain shard functions as an embodied bridge to grandmother, motivating the ink ritual; the renunciation—placing the shard in the mandala—earns resonance because the beat links prior grief to present release, showing visible cost as the ink darkens the fragment. Yet the “digital ghost” is explained away clinically, never acting as contradictory impulse or error, so the interior conflict stays single-note; the therapist label “chaos magic” momentarily flattens voice into diagnostic speak during the pivotal ritual, keeping the score shy of 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maerith’s quiet, jeweler-like precision and the solitary obsession with “texture into sound” feel lived-in; her body (copper veins) and micro-choices (angling the diamond, pressing bone) keep interiority concrete. The brother/daughter backstory is brief but tilts her present renunciation. No second character means no crucible, yet her final smile/press shows earned stasis. The flaw: we’re told of obsession more than shown its cost in real time—sleep, hunger, social rupture—so the emotional price is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her academic skepticism collides with bodily disorientation in the garden, and the arrowhead’s edge against her thumb replays her intellectual pivot. The phone-call from her dead mother is the single allowed reflective dump; it tilts her present choice and lands cost—she pockets the antenna, renouncing reportage for conversion. Magda’s pressure as gate-keeper is crisp, but Magda herself remains functional rather than contradictory. The refusal is earned, yet we do not feel the price on Elena's career or identity beyond the symbolic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s longing for “a world where beauty wasn’t scheduled” is concrete, but the leap from nostalgic busker to arboreal liberator is asserted rather than earned; the orchard’s sentience and her instant command of it feel convenient. Interiority is lyrical yet uniform—no moment lets us see her hesitate, fear, or mis-play. The locust shell is a nice emblem, but she presses it to the violin and the trees obey without visible cost or flaw, so her victory reads as pure wish. Still, her single-mindedness charges every beat and the final image of the walking forest forecloses her old life cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is precise—“mapping absences,” “respectfully rebellious”—and his micro-choices (pausing under the arch, cradling the bottle) embody the mailman credo. The final beat crystallizes his hierarchy of values: seventeen more deliveries before dawn, endurance as cost. Mira remains functional; her eyes “glisten” but we get no contradictory impulse, so relationship crucible is only lightly touched. Still, the single-POV restraint and embodied emotion hit the 9− threshold without a second character fully in the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carpenter’s muteness is more atmospheric label than operative flaw; her “quietly persistent” trait is shown in steady work, but no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes that steadiness, so interior conflict stays flat. The seven-year silence is cited repeatedly yet never complicates the present action—she never hesitates, doubts, or chooses speech at cost—so the renunciation feels pre-paid rather than earned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Meridian’s interiority is rich, embodied, and peculiar—her “tattered silk scarf” fidgeting, her preference for 3 AM’s “honest geometry.” The micro-choice to drape the scarf across the model dramatizes her value hierarchy and primes the final insight. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets are N/A; the grandmother is only memory, not present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s grief-quest is credibly embodied—camera clicks, paint-stained fingers, the tremor when she reads Iris’s post-script—yet the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“she understood now, finally”). No second character on stage, so status/relationship crucible is waived; the micro-choice to keep returning is visible and costs sleep & years, but the flaw-to-mistake linkage is static rather than compounding. For 600 words, the endurance stance is proportionate; still, the epiphany feels slightly telegraphed rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s contradictory need to protect and to create is dramatized through the tactile lock of hair and the micro-choice to surrender it; the embodied tremble in her words keeps interiority from sliding into label-speak. The locksmith’s “unassumingly bold” gaze is shown only once yet it pierces, not tells, and his later silence lets Mara’s agency own the turn. The moment she gasps that beauty might equal diminished love crystallizes internal conflict with a visible, felt cost that forecloses her old narrative. The silver-threaded return of the hair shows credible endurance: she leaves with the same object but an altered hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “chronically curious” nature is dramatized in her wading through tide, cross-referencing charts, and finally pressing the fairy ring; the return of the seventeen-year-old’s choice shows a believable arc. Interiority is specific (salt-apple smell, the gap “like a missing tooth”) and her flawed earlier cowardice complicates the present. The earned cost—accepting the burden of memory—lands cleanly. Only minor drift: “documenting everything” is told, not embodied, in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s desire to return home is visceral and embodied in her defiant tears; Miren’s doubled exile shows in her compulsive backward steps and the shard she keeps for herself. The micro-choice to pour more tea after Kael drains the cup signals Miren’s mentorship motive with tactile specificity. The final backward walk by Kael crystallizes the transfer of resilience without speech. Only small slip: “exile is an invitation” dips into therapeutic paraphrase mid-climax, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Esme’s gardener-poet interiority is consistent and specific; her patient observation and “subtle craft” credibly ground the cosmic graft. The only flaw is that the final beat registers more as serene completion than as a costly renunciation—her body aches but no path is foreclosed, so the Earned Stasis feels slightly under-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s tremoring hands, cracked mask, and vocational failure are concrete and embodied; her interior contradiction—restoring others while irreparable herself—drives every micro-choice. The decision to “drive the needle deep” is earned by the boy’s confession and her own stored silences, with visible cost: she adds another hollow quiet to her ribs. Relationship pressure is absent (only the ghost-boy), yet her self-conflict functions as crucible. Voice drifts once into diagnostic speak (“accumulates silence the way others collected scars”) but overall she remains a specific, flawed agent.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and specific—her noticing of grass spirals, her decision to leave the eastern approach open, her equation of maps with faith. The contradiction between scientific method and quasi-mystical listening is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final micro-choice (recommend the wound stay visible) carries visible cost: she risks professional censure and abandons the fantasy of complete knowledge. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9-band; no relationship crucible is available to test her stance under live opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s obsession with “borrowed” life and her methodical, almost numb calm under pressure read as a lived, embodied contradiction. The moment she recognizes the snow-globe and chooses to secure it crystallizes her hierarchy of values: knowledge-over-safety, witness-over-extraction. Interiority stays concrete (“hands trembled inside the submersible’s controls”) and the final renunciation—accepting transformation instead of solving loss—carries visible cost in the gesture of shaking the globe while ascending. Minor slip: the grandmother’s theoretic voice is filtered through Marina’s paraphrase, blurring the generational interior boundary by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority blooms: “fingers traced…symbols that hummed” and “tinkersong wonder, bright and chiming” give us body-level music. Contradictory impulse—yearning to be heard yet fearing vanishing—drives every beat. Micro-choices (gathering pigments, pressing the final plate) escalate to a visible cost: she forfeits her anonymity and solitary art to become the monastery’s amplifier. Only the “ghost” remains off-page, so relationship/status crucible is absent, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s curiosity-driven ascent and her tender refusal to mourn theatrically feel consistent and specific; the diary’s encryption-through-light demands she act, so her micro-choices (fitting the goggles, deciding to pack, choosing to reread) all flow from the same warmly inquisitive core. Interior contradiction is present—grief competes with wonder—yet both impulses share the page rather than alternate in summary, satisfying high-band demand. The only slap is the closing “affectionately detached”: that diagnostic label briefly inflates what the scene has already shown, nudging below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s grief is embodied in the cold glass, the oxidized fingerprints, the obsessive data entries; her contradictory need to “prove absence remembers” while clutching a dead man’s telescope gives her a sharp, idiosyncratic interior. The final micro-choice—closing the notebook, touching the brass—earns a quiet renunciation that forecloses normal science and accepts the sky-memorial cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is waived; solo arc is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The portraitist’s prosopagnosia is dramatized through tactile measurement and the paradox of painting faces she cannot recognize; her decision to photograph the coin and later paint the custodian from measured memory crystallizes a credible, earned endurance that forecloses no easy path. Interiority stays concrete—“fingertips across the canvas,” “coin grew warm against her ribs”—and the asymptotic flaw (never truly seeing wholes) drives every choice. No secondary character applies pressure on-page, but the single-POV arc satisfies; the final self-portrait-by-proxy is a visible cost. Voice remains distinct, never diagnostic, and the asymptote metaphor is lived, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s curiosity is concrete—kneeling with compass and chalk—but her “next great discovery” motive is only asserted twice; no moment shows her weighing risk vs. knowledge. The bolt-drag that frees the ship is a decision, yet feels like the only visible choice; earlier pattern-spotting is passive observation. Interior contradiction is hinted (“surrounded…yet utterly alone”) but not dramatized under pressure. Characterization is competent and texture-rich, but the decisive beat is thinly motivated compared to the vivid set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Celeste’s contradictory hunger—to stop being a hollow tool yet remain a locksmith—drives every beat; the vial micro-choice (uncapping starlight) is an embodied, perilous act that crystallizes her shift to repair-mender. Flaw remains active: she risks freezing her own agency by literalizing prophecy instead of questioning it, but the text lets that ambiguity stand. Cost is visible: the gears now hum against her heartbeat, signaling lifelong altered perception. Internal voice stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mirela’s ghost-stance is coherent—altruistic, consistent, and tied to the bell/chalk—but her interior contradiction is only asserted (“something in her refused to disperse”) rather than dramatized in a present-tense micro-choice. Kess’s turn is sharp and embodied, yet the community chorus stays abstract; no secondary character exerts live pressure on her. The final “I can rest now” registers as renunciation, but the cost is collective, not personal-g spectral, so the emotional price feels diffuse rather than ghost-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief versus duty, resignation versus hope—are dramatized inside each beat; her micro-choices (cradling the head, calibrating non-time, stepping into the pattern) externalize love and exhaustion. The broken puppet head acts as an embodied flaw that charges every beat; its dusting at closure is paid for by the prior cost of memory and humiliation. Interiority stays concrete (“functional enough to continue, broken enough to understand”) and avoids label-speak. The final self-dissolution is earned by the causal chain of lullaby-planting; we feel the cost of vanishing because her body was the last tool.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s interiority is textured (gnarled trees/“graceless beauty”) and her reluctant guardianship collides with an earned, self-authored purpose at the end. The hikers exist only as blank victims, so no relationship crucible; status dynamics aren’t on the page. Micro-choices—hover-walk, nut-warm—are concrete, yet the decisive turn (“someone had to stay”) is more thematic assertion than dramatized cost; we’re told she accepts, not shown the exact emotional toll. Still, the voice shows a consistent perceptual signature and the flaws complicate tactics, keeping her above caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and anchored in sensory science; the “solid grief blocking her throat” embodiment feels chemist-specific. Her shift from avoidance to recording voice notes is a credible micro-choice that reconfigures her stance toward Daniel’s death. The only thinning occurs in the single-line epiphany “she understood suddenly,” which leans diagnostic rather than earned in-scene. Still, the hierarchy of values—science as continuation of love—lands with visible cost: she leaves the ravine carrying the chrysalis, not the man.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her seeing moonlight as “quantified lack of sun” crystallizes her vocation. The single contradiction—selling forgetting yet needing memory—drives every micro-choice (mapping cuts, bottling clouded light). No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her stance shift from observer to secret archivist is earned and costs her anonymity. Flaw: the “clean-slate vendor” premise is label-asserted, not embodied in speech or gesture, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s tactile gift and chef discipline give her interiority muscle; every memory-taste is a bodily sensation, never label-speak. The single on-page choice—touching the coral bare-handed—triggers the entire arc, visibly paid for when her wrapped hands exit the fortress. Emotional contradiction is present (she braces against the flood yet savors the “feast”), but because the pavilion collapse is off-scene, the ultimate cost feels abstract rather than burned into her body. Still, her motives stay consistent and flawed: she goes down to sandpaper grief, not to heroically save anyone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s “empathetically decisive” trait is shown only in the council flashback; on-page she is gentle, reactive, and narratively flawless. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her final choice—she simply keeps singing—so the arc is warm but unmotivated. The promised grain-elevator conflict is off-loaded to the communities; she never confronts a dilemma that would test her trait under pressure. Interiority leans on stock abstractions (“her empathy sharpening”) rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s helix-minded interiority is concrete—her hands tremble, she spirals through code. Yet her motives plateau: we’re told she “had to complete this work” but never see the moment she commits to returning dreams; the final choice is attributed, not dramatized with cost. The predecessor’s absence keeps relational pressure off-stage. The character is strong, but the decisive turn lacks an embodied beat that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Celene’s “prism-minded” lens is dramatized in her angled reading of the page and in her bodily negotiation of the inverted grotto; interior contradiction is shown, not labeled. The decision to plant the seeds is the earned culmination of three years of off-page search, but the story withholds any on-page moment where she questions or costs herself in that quest—motivation is coherent yet thinly felt. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is NA; micro-choices under gravity inversion are concrete and specific. Closure choice (planting) is causally tied to prior discovery and carries visible cost in the moment of soil-into-stone, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular; her symphonic thinking is shown through wire-strumming, not labeled. The bleeding fingers, the choice to keep strumming despite pain, crystallizes cost on the page. One contradiction—she both “remembers when sound existed” yet concludes music never died—goes unacknowledged, a hairline flaw that keeps her just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Katrin’s exile-origin and “beauty in difficulty” creed are anchored to the basalt stone and chess set, giving her interiority a tactile loop; the contradiction between her dismissed aesthetic and the life-or-death task is dramatized in scene, not told. Micro-choices—arranging pieces, correlating patterns—track a believable competence/struggle balance. The final acceptance costs her the safety of orthodoxy and leaves her literally charged with teaching a new language: a visible, felt price. Only the “ten thousand anxious moments” cliché and one stock phrase (“heart raced with hopeful melancholy”) keep this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is concrete and character-specific—Marcella’s purple-stained fingers, her taxonomy of silences, her theatrical murmurs all ground her eccentric pacifist genius. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread of violence) coexist in real time as she tunes, and the final renunciation—choosing to witness rather than shield—is earned by the causal chain of frequencies tried. Micro-choices (each dial adjustment) visibly cost her stamina and emotional safety, fulfilling the 9+ test. The minor slip into diagnostic-speak “understanding blooming” is the only hairline flaw touching the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirien’s interior contradiction—gifted nose that cripples her—is dramatized in every beat: she plants the seed, stays put while retching, and re-weights her sensitivity into serenity. The micro-choice to press the petal inside her journal crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are waived. The only slip is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“this is the work”) that slightly flattens the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s goal is crisp and personal; her flying skill is shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete (“stomach lurched,” “breath caught”). The final decision to confront the council is earned by the canister discovery, but the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied—no lingering tremor or tactile memory of grandmother’s voice—so the arc feels competent, not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s engineer-daughter identity is cleanly anchored to the patch and paternal memory; her micro-choice to re-scope the investigation from structural to meteorological is visible and stakes-shift the mission. Interiority stays concrete (“breath catch,” fingers on patch) without label-speak. Yet the evacuation epiphany is confessed rather than dramatized, so the cost feels second-hand; the “hazy precision” refrain never collides with a personal price that would foreclose her path.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—synesthetic gift vs. monk-like solitude—is dramatized in his tactile warming of the bell while suppressing its voice. Micro-choices (sending word to the sculptor, warming metal, stopping the final bell) visibly chart his hierarchy of values. The “unfettering” lands as earned renunciation: he forsakes personal song so wonder can re-enter the world, cost felt in the hush he must inhabit afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—need to atone vs. dawning acceptance—threads every beat; the flute’s weight “comfort and accusation” embodies it. Micro-choices (mapping, uncasing, playing) tighten because/therefore chains. Earned endurance at the end forecloses restoration path with visible cost: “she would return…harvest these moments…until the flute gave out.” Mentor loss, ward loss, and relic decay are felt in body, not label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The operator’s interiority is richly layered—borrowed gestures, embodied precision, fear of incompleteness—each choice visibly costs him identity. The moment he admits “mine is incomplete” renounces the safety of masks; the halo-press page becomes a literal skin he can no longer hide behind. Mira functions as crucible: her reading of the page crystallizes his gamble and forces mutual recognition. Micro-choices (type selection, fragment placement, lever pull) all encode self-solve urgency; no stock phrasing, competent struggle throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kessa’s embodied tremor, pulse-anchored interiority, and the final steady-handed turn all feel earned; the pendant’s hum makes micro-choices legible under pressure. The only slack is a slight over-label of “nervousness” early on instead of purely somatic cues. Still, her hierarchy of values (wonder > speed) crystallizes in the farmer beat and charges the closing image. Cost is visible: she surrenders protective haste and accepts emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s shift from performative skeptic to unwilling inheritor of secret knowledge is dramatized through tactile micro-choices: pocketing the prism, softening her vision, letting the rainbow vanish. The embodied grief—hand-heated glass, breath-clouds, frost mirroring her wheel-grips—keeps interiority concrete. Internal contradiction is present but thin: she never actively fights the new truth; she pivots the moment evidence appears. Closure is earned because the decision to continue Castellan’s “real work” is paid for by the visible darkening of the prism and the arbor’s embrace—cost is felt, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The loom-spinner’s interiority is concrete—bleeding fingers, the amber bead lifted from her neck, the loom’s silence—yet her motives stay elemental (save daughter, give life) rather than contradicted under pressure. The single contradiction we see is the memory of laughter that “cut deep” while her face stays “stoically sparkling,” a nice fracture, but it never complicates the onward plan. Her final renunciation is earned and costly, yet because no secondary pressure (another person, a ticking resource) ever tests her, the arc is linear rather than genuinely crucible-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s quiet, stoic perseverance is credibly embodied: hunched shoulders, whispered voice, and the deliberate hammer blows all manifest the “meek” trait while the steady sacrifice of memories dramatizes resolve. Interiority stays concrete—he forgets his mother’s face but remembers the imperative to heal, giving interior contradiction live weight. The final collapse is earned: every traded memory tightens the causal chain toward the resonant, hollowed-out victory. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; the single-POV focus is tight and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaia’s interiority is vivid—embodied coldness, “hot stones” in the chest—and her final “Teach me” is a credible, earned shift. Yet the mother remains a dream-figure; their reunion lacks status friction or micro-choice that would force Kaia to test her hierarchy of values under pressure. The abandonment wound is confessed, not dramatized in present beats, so the emotional cost feels inherited rather than freshly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid—her noticing as attention, her muteness as care—yet the climactic decision to return weekly is declared more than dramatized. The final whisper “I see you” is embodied, but the enduring pledge lacks a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. Still, her contradictory impulse—silent by habit yet driven to speak into darkness—carries real character tension.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s laughing storm-herald persona is vivid and embodied—her laughter mixes with thunder, her body moves through the spiral stairs with practiced ease, and her micro-choices (inserting the wick, logging prophecies) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete: “peculiar joy found only in darkness” is specific to her, not a label. Yet the interior contradiction—why she keeps laughing while knowingly steering strangers toward danger—remains asserted, not dramatized in-scene; the cost of her prophetic power is announced (“one day someone will understand”) rather than felt. The Earned Stasis is present but lightly weighted; we see the ritual endurance, yet the price she pays for shaping futures with ancient shadows stays conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dye master’s interiority—rooted in color, light, and the morpho wing—remains vivid and embodied; her quiet “why me” conflict is credibly contradictory. The final acceptance of the inherited listener-role is micro-choices-driven, but the beat is compressed into a single nod; cost is felt yet not fully dramatized, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s maintenance-worker lens gives tactile, embodied attention to stone, kit, pin; her micro-choices (climb, lift, press thumb to glass) are concrete, contradictory impulses under pressure. The internal split—obedience to measured sorrow vs hunger for unquantified healing—drives every beat and is paid for by the dawn-long labor that leaves her “carrying moonlight in her bones.” No stock therapeutic self-diagnosis; flaw (compulsive witness/curator) complicates the final act. The renunciation of pure measurement is earned, costly, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s dissolution-into-light choice is foreshadowed by the “bound release” lullaby and tracked through every shard-orbit; the cost is felt when “she felt herself growing thinner.” Interiority stays imagistic, never diagnostic. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, but the single-mind arc is complete and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eleanor’s interior contradiction—longing to serve while fearing emotional absorption—stays concrete through tactile beats (smoothing the invitation, pressing into shadows). The micro-choice to step out of hiding crystallizes her arc; cost is felt in the exposed stillness of the final nod. One slip: “wisdom often arrives disguised as error” drifts into diagnostic-speak mid-epiphany, blunting embodiment. Otherwise, motivation remains consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s perceptual signature—hyper-attentive erosion-watching—pushes her beyond passive observer into deliberate planter; each seed choice is a micro-choice under internal pressure. The bread moment lets her taste complicity, showing guilt without diagnostic labels. Final resolve to seed the east wing crystallizes an earned, costed stance, though interior contradiction could be sharper in-scene rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Celeste’s life-long archivist calling and quiet, embodied diligence ("gently meticulous steps") stay believable and specific; her interiority never slips into label-speak. The renunciation—transforming the library instead of saving it—carries credible cost, yet her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. let go) are told more than enacted in scene; we’re not shown a moment where she wavers with visible friction, so the change feels lightly mediated rather than dramatically forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Della’s contradictory drives—vengeance vs. mercy—are shown in embodied micro-choices (finger on recorder, hand on fob, final release of Kern). The heirloom’s weight and the recorder’s hidden button give tangible cost to her shifting stance. Interiority stays concrete: “the watch fob grew warm against her chest” anchors emotion without label-speak. Final renunciation is earned because the recorded confession is already in her pocket; letting Kern go feels like a visible forfeit of justice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaia’s luminous glow and metallic-taste synesthesia are vividly embodied; her need to “know the mechanism” propels every beat. The interior contradiction—skepticism vs. the body’s involuntary bioluminescence—remains active in scene. The ring-hand-off to the mist-walker crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost (grandmother’s past traded for uncertain future). micro-choices (twisting ring, tongue tasting ozone) consistently reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—memorializing strangers while burying her own gift—grounds every beat. The embodied smudge of charcoal on cold stone crystallizes grief; her choice to climb back up is earned by the letter’s weight and the docent’s pressure. Flaws (guilt, mnemonic curse) actively complicate the moment she touches the canvas again. Dialogue is sparse, but the docent’s intrusion supplies external pressure that forces status shift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s hybrid nature—leaves that physically respond to honesty—gives her interiority a concrete, idiosyncratic gauge that is shown every time her temples flare or wilt. The beat-to-beat alignment of her body with truth-telling keeps motivation legible and stakes personal; when Kade admits fear, the immediate unfurling crystallizes their first honest transaction. The only drag is the late-introduced neighbor: his turn from hollow banter to confession is credible but compressed, so the relationship-as-crucible effect is more asserted than dramatized. Still, her final micro-choice—to return and invite others—pays the cost of exposure in a city built on necessary lies, earning the story’s quiet but visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s tactile devotion to her bells and her seasonally mute body give her interiority a concrete, idiosyncratic pulse; every micro-choice (suspending the ice, listening to droplets) is anchored to her need to keep wonder audible. The flaw—her compulsive, almost monastic self-subtraction—drives the action and is left unresolved, a credible renunciation that costs her another winter of silence. Because no second character shares the bluff, relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A, but the solitary choreography is lucid and purposeful. The only minor drag is a few lyrical self-descriptions that edge toward label-speak (“symphonies of truth”), briefly cooling embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The android’s ache for the lost child is rendered as a literal data corruption its diagnostics cannot purge—interiority made flesh in circuitry. Every micro-choice (gathering stalks, sparking fire, folding its own code) springs from that ache and the need to miniaturize the new chaos. The final stance—fragmented but functional, humming a lullaby while replanting—earns its cost: the roses and the child’s box are ash, yet the android keeps tending. Contradictory impulses (preserve memory / destroy containment) act simultaneously in-scene, not in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s curator reflex is shown believably—she “handled the aged locket with careful reverence,” catalogs Iris through neighbors, and courts no epiphany. Interiority stays concrete; the choice to approach Iris is small but earned. Flaw: her grief-motive is asserted (“learned too late…”) not dramatized, muting internal contradiction. No status/relationship crucible on-page keeps score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her algae “syllables,” her pirouetted codes—and every micro-choice (rolling the dice, mounting the stairs) grows from the established lyrical-coder trait. The cost is palpable: she abandons the journals that anchored her years of captivity. What keeps this from 9-band is the slight over-tidiness of her emotional arithmetic: fear “crystallizes,” hope “becomes buoyant” in the same beat, a packaged symmetry where a messier contradiction would feel truer under imminent freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren’s grief for her grandmother anchors every move; the lantern-lighting ritual, the night vigils, the decision to drag alien pockets into a salt cave all flow from a single, legible wound. Interiority stays concrete—“gleaming silence inside her”—and her micro-choice to lift the first pocket with a dock pole crystallizes values without exposition. She is the only actor, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the story meets single-POV allowance. Final recovery of the wildflower memory pays the cost of obsession, but the text hedges her flaw: no visible stamina loss, no mistake that backfires, so the arc crests competent rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Summoner’s interiority is lyrical but generic; “tranquil blaze of focus” is label-speak, not embodied contradiction. She acts—mapping, trading hush—but the cost (solitude entrenchment) is asserted, not dramatized on her body or choice. Still, her calm agency propels every beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s curiosity is embodied through tactile micro-choices (climbing to the apartment, watching the seal catch starlight) and a credible hierarchy of values—comfortable denial vs. hunger for truth—culminating in the costly request “Teach me everything.” Dr. Khoury’s immortal poise is shown via gesture, not label, and her patiently-nimble trait visibly constrains how she measures sugar and traces glyphs, making the immortal tutor feel individual, not archetype. The relationship shift from neighborly ritual to mentor–initiate is dramatized in the rooftop interrogation beat, so the bond itself becomes the crucible. Only minor shortfall: we don’t yet see how immortality has internally scarred her; that extra contradiction would push to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is rich—her skepticism, grief, and stubborn refusal to accept isolation as death feel lived-in. The embodied reaction to the seashell’s resonance and her micro-choice to press it to her chest ground her arc. Yet the sister Anya remains an off-page memory rather than relationship-as-crucible, so the relational pressure that could force a costlier stance is missing. The final renunciation (“we start with Anya’s full memory sequence”) is credible but the emotional price is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lien’s contradictory sense of service-to-master vs treason-to-state is dramatized through the bleeding thumb, loaded brush, and final quiet exit; interiority is concrete and embodied. Micro-choice of mixing blood into ink crystallizes her value hierarchy on the page. Final stance of “earned betrayal” is foreshadowed and paid for with the dulled thorn left behind—visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; headcount stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority is grounded in concrete sensory action (“clutched the seashell,” “pressed herself into a side corridor”). The moment her voice splits is dramatized, not declared, giving visible cost to her transformation. Still, the final beat leans on abstract heritage speech rather than a micro-choice that seals her new allegiance. The earned shift is legible, but the last paragraph drifts into choral exposition that softens the personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority is rich—her perceptual filter (“diving-callused palms,” “borrowed starlight”) individuates her—but her decisive turn to contact the archives is declared rather than dramatized, softening the cost of her promise to the captain. The trait “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” appears early and shapes her nightly ritual, yet no contradictory impulse tests her in-scene; she moves from comprehension to action without friction, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained. Still, her embodied emotion and micro-choices under glacial pressure keep her convincingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Chen’s interiority is textured through tactile net-work and moon-tracking; her patience and “hidden effort” ethic are embodied, not declared. The withheld name and whistle-code give her a lived past, yet the piece stops short of forcing her into a high-stakes choice tonight—her decision to “show the whisk tomorrow” is preparatory, so the cost feels prospective rather than paid. Still, contradiction simmers: she prizes anonymity yet signals presence with melody, a tension the prose trusts us to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority—her “sharply observant gaze” cataloging anomalies—stays concrete and causal; the moment she feeds the papers into the stove is a credible renunciation that costs her the identity she arrived with. The flaw: we never feel her body under stress; the night-long reconstruction is summarized, not embodied, so the price feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vera’s loneliness and visionary drive stay credible; her refusal to pick sides is a believable flaw that costs her freedom under the portico. Interiority is rich (“laughed at the absurdity—how lonely it was to be claimed…”) yet never slides into self-help jargon. No contradiction under pressure, but the absence of a second on-page character keeps the crucibal relationship test idle. The final smile and switch-off land as Earned Stasis with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interiority is textured through sand-in-the-mouth detail and watch-repair fingers; her contradictory mix of scavenger survival and archivist tenderness is dramatized in every micro-choice. The decision to gift the layered recording to Mrs. Chen’s class feels inevitable yet costly—she forfeits her hermit safety for public witness. No secondary character applies live pressure, so status/relationship bullets are waived. The “something sweeten inside her chest” moment risks label-speak but is saved by its juxtaposition with salt-stiff coat and pennies-only pockets, letting the bodily cost ground the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s engineer-logic versus grief-strained intuition is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—pressing palm to ice, unhooking recorder, humming a counter-frequency—each of which externalizes the “logically emotional” trait with visible cost. The interior contradiction holds: she calculates resonance while weeping, refusing both destruction and erasure, culminating in an earned renunciation that crystallizes Kael into the chorus. No stock therapy-speak; even “sonic absolution” is filtered through physical vibration in her teeth. The only flaw is a slight late convenience: Kael’s instantaneous freeze could use one prior beat of bodily adaptation foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—hot grief cooled into glacial patience—drives every micro-choice (quiet steps, map folds, renunciation of gear). Her sister’s death is never exposited; it surfaces only as embodied tension in the breath-cloud beat, giving the final “we move” its cost. The “horizon mapper” label is earned through tactile use of moonlight and magnetic stone, not diagnosis. Only cap: no visible flaw in closure choice itself, yet the group’s collective agency slightly dilutes the single-POV intensity demanded at 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sara’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the tremor she refuses to acknowledge under the lantern light is character-specific. The contradictory pull between bureaucratic survival and ancestral duty is held in simultaneous tension rather than alternated, satisfying the “both-at-once” test. Micro-choices—each photo, each measurement—are visible acts of rebellion that foreclose the safe-report path with cumulative cost. The lantern inheritance motif could feel safer than her flaw, but the final climb re-weights it as lived risk, not inherited talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s guilt and need for repair are palpable; the trembling hands and fifteen-year weight embody the stake. Interior contradiction—self-forgiveness versus duty—drives the present decision. The final micro-choice (committing to Thursday delivery) costs him lingering shame and is credibly earned. Voice remains priest-specific without lapsing into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Fennec’s “steadily curious” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized in a choice that costs her anything; the transliterating is busy-work, not a crucible. No contradiction or micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority lapses into editorial abstraction (“the mathematics of human hunger”) rather than embodied reaction. The hunter-tip beat is cool but Fennec’s stance toward it stays static—no visible flaw or gamble—so the ending poise feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s need to locate deleted minds is personal and legible; the brother reveal lands late but pays off. Interiority is concrete (“ran her fingers over the embroidered Artemis-7 insignia”) and choices escalate. Still, the final extraction decision is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc crests just short of earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s calm-intuitive peacekeeper trait is dramatized—she unfurls shadows, chooses the fragment, steers the elders with a visible micro-choice (“hold this”) that forces their stance shift. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; her empathy is mapped onto action, not declared. The elders’ sudden convergence is too friction-free—decades feud dissolves in one shared smile—but Kael’s cost (exposing her shard, risking failure) is legible, and her shadow-sense gives her a consistent, particular perceptual signature. Flaws are accepted: her calm is a tool, not perfection, and the ending forecloses continued enmity without tidy forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—scheduled death versus the will to keep helping—co-exist in scene, not exposition. The micro-choice to ferry the stranded family crystallizes her new hierarchy of values. The parasol’s cracked tip embodies earned endurance rather than easy symbolism. What keeps this from 9-band is that the grandmother’s “crossed over” line is the only external pressure testing Vera’s stance; a second on-page challenge would have foreclosed the Nuuk option with sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—burning Dimitri’s letter yet keeping the fragment—are dramatized in the opening beat and pay off when she lets the char fall. Marco’s “gently persuasive” trait is shown, not labeled, in the grafting monologue that shifts her stance. Both families’ feud is externalized through the vineyard water-rights history and the lantern-lit pavilion space, giving their union a felt social cost. The final micro-choice—staying for the night—forecloses the morning-bus escape and is earned by the prior vine-graft logic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s calm, self-sacrificing resolve feels consistent and specific; her “strangely honest” stance and half-mask as void-touched mark her without cliché. Interiority stays concrete—she weighs the cost of consecration through bodily sensation and stone rhythm. The decisive renunciation is foreshadowed early and paid in the final breath, giving her arc visible cost. Flaw: the prophet is a static oracle, exerting pressure but revealing no interior contradiction to mirror Maya’s own.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward label-speak (“the grammar of grief”), softening embodied pressure. Mira’s calm is shown through repeatable ritual rather than micro-choices that tighten risk. The townspeople arrive as a chorus; no single secondary character applies new pressure. She does not visibly pay a cost for her role; the closure remains communal, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, idiosyncratic: “weathered innocence,” “roots deep…branches stretching toward light.” Micro-choice—lifting the crystal—crystallizes her stake. Reticence is told more than shown; we get zero spoken words, so the trait is asserted, not dramatized. Final resolve is earned, but the cost is conceptual, not personal—keeps her just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marcus’s “precognitive forgetting” is more label than lived contradiction; the chalk and driftwood choices feel deliberate rather than driven by a visible, conflicting impulse. Sarah’s presence supplies relational pressure, but her interiority is ventriloquized through Marcus’s prophecy, softening the crucible. The final renunciation—hearing the sound yet refusing to trap it—lands as Charged Poise, earned by the motif of listening, not by prior dramatized flaw. Interiority drifts into abstract thesis (“that’s all prophecy is”) at the exact beat where embodied cost should peak.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s quiet, tactile competence and jeweler’s loupe shorthand her life-long craft; the seismic tremors force her to act, not merely muse. Her mid-scene micro-choice—re-gear the escapement to honor the tremor rhythm—crystallizes a believable hierarchy of values (craft over clock-face order). The final “leaf-falling” auditory epiphany carries visible cost: she forfeits canonical time, accepting perpetual instability. Interiority stays sensorial, not therapeutic; no stock labels undercut the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s “decisively kind” trait is shown through immediate, costly action—seventeen phone calls, creative labor—yet interiority stays general (“a prayer made flesh”). Richard’s regret is embodied in the vinyl shard; Linda arrives already softened, so the reconciliation lacks visible struggle. The earned change is Richard’s, not Maya’s, leaving her somewhat archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s quietly deliberate precision is shown, not told, through her finger-tracing and methodical chart-checking; the interior contradiction between scholar and “shadow-being” is dramatized in the final cross-legged vigil. The micro-choice to insert the key and the later decision to “return” both grow from her established trait and carry visible conceptual cost. Sleeping-Mira’s “more solid” face supplies the external mirror that makes the flaw legible. Closure is earned: her stance crystallizes under the noon deadline she herself invokes.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s skepticism and medical vocation collide productively with the changeling request; her “show me” is an active, profession-rooted micro-choice that alters tactics and forecloses lifelong certainty. Interiority stays embodied and specific—her certainty “cracking open like an egg,” teeth aching at harmonics—avoiding abstract labels. The final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost: she walks out carrying “a healing she’d learned to perform on reality itself,” a concrete, profession-metaphor burden that locks her into new agency. One slip: the line “universe was stranger and more merciful” drifts toward platitude; tighter diction here would lift the score into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to memory while converting it into light—remains embodied in every micro-choice (polishing, placing, breathing the grotto). The “pearl of stillness” quest is dramatized, not labelled, and the final renunciation of fire-charged vengeance is earned through two decades of tactile ritual. Cost is visible: raw fingertips, the empty pouch, the admission that some blue shards must stay unknowable. Only the absence of on-page secondary characters prevents the relationship crucible test from lifting this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s “quietly proactive” nature is dramatized: she tends the garden, withholds speech, and offers the pendant only when the visitor’s silence begs for ritual. The executive’s shame is equally embodied—trembling palms, red-rimmed eyes—so both arcs feel earned. What caps the score is the absence of a visible cost to Mira herself; she grants absolution but the story never tests her compassion with a real forfeiture. Interior contradiction flickers (“I used to [hate]”) yet stays summary, so the change is more declared than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The novelist’s grief-riven paralysis is viscerally embodied in her trembling grip on the seashell, her micro-choice to “open her notebook” at the nexus is the earned pivot that forecloses endless mourning and makes the writing act feel like a costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into therapy-speak; the contradiction between needing closure and refusing it is held in scene, not summarized. The stranger’s cameo is the external pressure that crystallizes the hierarchy: continuing > finding. Only the daughter’s drowning is relayed in retrospective summary rather than dramatized memory, a slight flattening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maera’s interiority is rich—her tactile attentiveness, the “whimsical tinkerer” label, and the quiet cost of her three-year quest all feel embodied. The earned final hush and her decision to let credit remain unnamed show a credible renunciation. Flaws: no second character on-page, so status/relationship pressure is absent; the “golden stories” trait is named twice but never dramatized in a choice. Still, her micro-choices (selecting tendrils, singing cracked-voice) are specific and tied to the remedy’s cost, satisfying the single-POV crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemist’s grief is palpable and embodied; her micro-choices (kneeling, arranging refuse with “deliberate slowness”) externalize patience and loss. Interiority stays concrete—starlight as liquid silver, pulse as geography—avoiding diagnostic speak. The final beat of memorizing the vanished map earns a credible renunciation, though the child remains more mythic than lived; this flattens contradiction and caps emotional complexity just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete—her preference for “observant” over “reflective” crystallizes stance—but emotional contradiction is told abstractly (“mystery and understanding weren’t enemies”). The final renunciation (sealing the cavern) is earned by her winter-long investment, yet the cost is stated, not embodied: we see no moment where the ache of secrecy registers in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    The weaver’s interiority is evocative—her whalebone reverie and boundary-less trap feel lived—but she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the final resignation is foreshadowed, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the realization is delivered as reflective summary rather than embodied conflict. The calcified weights are gorgeous, yet their handling never forces her to adjust tactics or risk loss; the story tells us she is trapped, but the page never makes her sweat under that trap. Characterization is strong on texture, weak on agency.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradiction—grief’s need to preserve vs. carving’s need to subtract—remains active in every micro-choice, but the “hauntingly practical” label is announced, not dramatized; still, her embodied handling of blank and blade, plus the final earned stasis of keeping the laugh-figure, pays visible cost and caps the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kera’s contradictory impulse—clutching others’ discarded dreams while dodging her own—surfaces in every beat; the camera-wheel click she pockets is a micro-choice that forecloses perpetual delay. The ghost’s silent invitation crystallizes her hierarchy of values: legacy > shame. Interiority is embodied (“regret tasted like copper and cloud-water”) not therapized. Cost is legible: the ghost’s cool solid hand accepts her past, ending the stall but not absolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s curiosity-to-action arc is legible, but her “functional creativity” is asserted rather than dramatized in key beats; the interiority drifts into thesis-speak (“puzzle out new equations for hope”). The renunciation of carnival transience for rooted stewardship lands as a resonant reconfiguration—yet the cost (lost mobility, institutional friction) is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s retreat-from-music wound is vividly embodied (trembling hand, tear-wet cheeks) and the micro-choice to play anyway crystallizes her hierarchy of values; the renunciation of virtuoso dreams is earned, visible, and carries a felt cost in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his dawning recognition that “someone had taken Dessen’s real story… and wrapped it in fantasy” is embodied in the bent gnomon he turns in his palm. The contradiction between chasing magic and uncovering grief is held in scene, not summarised. Micro-choice—photographing the maps, pocketing the broken sundial—crystallises his hierarchy of values. Cost is felt: the legend quest is renounced, replaced by a colder, archival duty.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s calm, solitary interiority is vivid and sustained; her embodied emotion shows in snow on shoulders, stiff knees, the rope’s texture. The rope-decoding beat gives us micro-choices that escalate her want (save chamomile) into an on-page plan. No contradictory impulses or interior loops, but the cost is still abstract—no visible risk or forfeiture yet—so the arc feels complete yet safe.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—documenting absence while seeking healing—is vivid; her micro-choice to steady Thomas’s hand reconfigures both stakes. Thomas’s tremor and retained thread embody credible flaw and competence. The final intimacy costs her detachment, earned by prior causal chain. Only the “geography of healing” line flirts with label-speak, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prince’s obsessive, self-taught resurrection quest is vividly interiorized—his trembling hands, nightly neglect of food, tears on the coat—so his drive feels lived-in. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. knowledge of forgery, duty vs. theft of lab parts) stay active in scene, not summary. The final smile carries credible cost: his heirloom sword gone, father’s censure, the creature itself a “bitterly sweet” hybrid that can never live outside the cave. Only minor safety-hedging keeps him from 9.0: he never confronts the king in moment, and his scientific errors carry no real failure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s contradictory need to atone for her father’s fires while using his hoarded coins charges every beat; the moment she presses the grafting blade into Marcus’s scarred hands, her unspoken self-test (“am I my father?”) is embodied, not declared. Interiority stays firefighter-specific (she clocks smoke, gauges wind) and never drifts into therapy-speak. The final renunciation—letting the coins become talismans for others—pays the visible cost of never reclaiming her own innocence, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—radiant yet doubting—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to “press her glowing palm” against the map fuses trait to action. The final renunciation of luminescence costs her visible identity, earned by prior causal chain. No stock labels; emotion stays sensory (“heard the geese returning north, their honking loud with joy”). Secondary characters absent, so relationship bullets skipped; head-count clarity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Keeper’s solitary-millennia loneliness, brass-gear lineage, and “peculiar grief called hope” give concrete interior contradiction; the renunciation of fresh seeds is embodied in the slow release of petals, foreclosing any other path with visible cosmic fatigue. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped. Micro-choices—inserting the gear, selecting six young fires, letting seeds drift—map a clear hierarchy of values under immutable duty. The flaw (compulsive caretaking) directly fuels the climax; endurance costs are felt in the final “listening for the next call.”

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—clinging to solitary carving while craving communal grief—is vivid early, but her shift to “connection-mapping” is declared more than dramatized; the final stance lacks a micro-choice that shows cost on the page. Thomas’s flickering mentorship supplies pressure, yet their dialogue drifts into sage pronouncements rather than concrete give-and-take that would sharpen Elena’s decision path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradiction—ritual precision vs. private grief—plays out in tactile micro-choices (finger-counting turns, pressing the rake handle into the brass). Emotional embodiment is exact: salt-stiff palms, the pendulum’s two-hundred-pound threat, the “loosening” felt by unseen widows. The final burn-and-scatter decision is foreshadowed by her seventeen-year habit of erasing individual sorrow into collective time, so renunciation carries visible cost. Voice never slips into diagnostic talk; instead, salt, brass, and obsidian become the lexicon of conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s quiet caretaker persona is credibly inhabited—her humming at the gate, the tender shelving of records, the decision to plant Helena’s rose all flow from a consistent interior stance. The only flaw: the climactic interior beat (“the uncharted echoes weren’t sounds but the reverberations of a love…”) drifts into diagnostic-speak, blunting embodied cost; a −0.4 there keeps her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—mapping ignorance while blind to her own—stays off-stage; the quill and ink feel ritualized rather than urgent. Micro-choices are present (cleaning the quill, choosing parchment) but carry no visible cost or risk. The ending’s “suspended future” offers earned stasis, yet her flaw never complicates the decision path, so tension stays intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient copyist vs. clandestine archivist—drives every micro-choice; the “dust learns to remember” motive is vivid, embodied, and scales to the final cost. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible waived; solo POV sustains pressure. Final renunciation (banking the radio, accepting continued peril) is earned and foreclosed. Interiority stays concrete; only minor label-speak glint (“confirmation”) keeps this from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—burning portraits yet secretly preserving ash—are dramatized in charcoal-smeared micro-choices; her final lie-by-omission to Cassius is earned by the gallery’s long habit of vanishing. Cost is felt when she pockets the ash she swears to scatter, foreclosing her own creed. Interiority stays concrete: “powdered hands” vs “soot-stained ones” shows the split. Voice remains single, steady; no occupational drift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcellus’s rational-rebel stance is consistently embodied through tactile micro-choices—thumb-flicking the brass cog, sealing the archive above the waterline—so his endurance feels earned. The interior contradiction (calm vs. seething contempt) stays alive in scene, not summary. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount waiver applies. Cost is visible: irrelevance = philosopher’s death, and he accepts it in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s “expectant resignation” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a moment of costly choice; her interiority stays at label level (“travelled stillness,” “patience”) and the climactic transfer of the zither carries no visible sacrifice or risk, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s trait‐anchor (chef‐taster of memories) is vivid in the greenhouse, her pruning micro-choices track, and her final smile shows earned poise, but her interiority drifts into abstract “knowledge/hope” language (“taste of determination,” “recipe of hope”) rather than concrete palate-images under pressure; the contradiction is latent, not dramatized in-scene, so the arc feels observed rather than tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s blunt-truth tic is dramatized early and shapes the encounter; her solitary vigil, tactile attention to puddles and tower shadows, and the trembling choice to climb give us embodied interiority. The beekeeper’s veiled authority is sketched in two beats, enough to pressure Mira without violating single-POV focus. The final ascent is a micro-choice that visibly costs her isolation and forecloses her old stoic routine—earned, on-page. No internal contradiction is shown in-scene, so the missing 9+ hinge is the absence of a second conflicting impulse under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s perceptual acuity, perfume-shop childhood, and decision to keep returning anchor the arc; embodied contradiction blooms when the house’s exhalation relaxes her own held breath. Interiority is concrete and sense-bound, never abstract. Final renunciation—shifting from observer to participant—pays the cost of her old detachment and is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s stone endurance and telepathic restraint give her a disciplined, ancient interiority that stays consistent; the descendant’s trembling hands and stammered questions embody live human fragility. Their value clash—statue certainty vs. human grief—drives every beat and culminates in her shouldering the ampoule, a credible renunciation of simple martyrdom myths. Minor slip: “incisive kindness” is named instead of dramatized in one early sentence. Still, both voices remain distinct and their mutual pressure alters each stance by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s mathematician identity and obsession with proving perpetual motion drive every beat; the diced-roll habit and wall-scribbling are concrete, character-specific rituals that externalize her mind. Her interior contradiction—rigorous logic feeding an irrational hope—remains active in scene, not summarized. The final laugh crystallizes Earned Stasis: she sees the cost of her own proof yet keeps climbing, a credible grim optimist. Only minor: the “three-years-ago” block is cleanly anchored but still feels like off-page exposition rather than lived memory.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her insomnia, palette mixing, and trembling steadiness feel lived-in. The contradictions of exhaustion versus disciplined creation are sharp, but the final “threshold state” shift is stated more than dramatized; we are told the brush “rouses” her rather than seeing a micro-choice that costs her something tangible. Still, her value hierarchy (lost alphabets → painted kindnesses) remains coherent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Celeste’s curator-caregiver identity is sharply etched—her grandfather’s watch, the practiced warmth masking dread, the way she steers refugees past relics while measuring her own despair. The micro-choice to invite the violinist to bake signals a hinge: she risks reopening her own wound to keep culture alive. Interior contradiction is present yet compressed; the “rosewater dread” line risks label-speak but is saved by sensory specificity. Cost is felt: inviting the woman commits her to daily exposure of her own unprocessed grief.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—devotion to backward clocks vs. hunger to reverse lived loss—drives every beat; the trembling fingers, dawn smile, and jeweler precision show embodied cost. No second character, so status lens is waived; his micro-choice to throw the yoyo crystallizes values hierarchy with irreversible felt price. Motivation scales cleanly from hobbyist rebellion to existential gambit. 9+ quick test met: contradictory impulses in scene and causally earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s terror of erasure and her pivot toward embracing dissolution are embodied in the mirror beat; the clasp pulse against her skin shows micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“silver warm against her skin,” “repulsive, beautiful green light”) rather than label-speak. The final refusal to solidify is earned by prior causal chain—each confession literally blurs her further—so the renunciation carries visible cost. Advisor remains functional catalyst, but his absence of motive or status shift keeps relationship crucible slightly under-served.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s prophet identity, tactile obsession with resonance, and embodied exhaustion feel lived-in; the apple bite at the end crystallizes her earned cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and her micro-choices (“Mercy,” “Hold,” etc.) reveal a value hierarchy under pressure. The only minor gap: we get no contradictory impulse in-scene; she’s all-in, so the arc is steady rather than knotted. Still, the endurance itself is credibly costly and specific to her.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s quiet obsession with the whistle and spiral grammar is concrete, but her interiority stays curiously flat; we never feel her lungs tighten when she realizes the council lied. The decision to descend is reported, not dramatized, so the cost of that choice is only conceptual. Still, her perceptual lens—shell-math as first language—remains vivid and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Helena’s “emotional rationality” is asserted repeatedly but never pressures her choices; the same beat—photograph, wrap, decide—could play with any temperament. Interiority relies on summary labels (“understood,” “balanced”) instead of contradictory impulses in-scene. She pays a social cost (career forfeiture), yet the prose announces rather than dramatizes the weight of that loss during the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and specific—Garrett’s grief is filtered through sensory memory and tool-handling. The contradictory impulse to measure yet secretly commemorate is dramatized in the single beat where he both records erosion and slips the note into the crack. Cost is visible: the act commits him to lifelong secrecy and perpetual return. Only the “archeologist of abandoned dreams” tag drifts toward diagnostic self-label, keeping it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s quiet, methodical temperament is etched into every micro-choice—cataloguing by head-lamp, slipping stamp into pocket—so the indexer identity feels lived-in. The buried contradiction between grandmother’s defeat and his own need to prove her right drives the single POV cleanly, and the final renunciation (calm return to desk) carries visible social cost: he must keep acting the obedient functionary while now armed with proof. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only a hairline gap: we glimpse no transient stress-degradation of perception under pressure, keeping embodiment just shy of 9-band immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s grief is embodied through tactile micro-choices—selecting gems, polishing, folding—yet her interiority occasionally slides into abstract “luminous torment” labels that feel diagnostic rather than lived. The thousand-crane vow supplies motive, but the pivot from paper to dream-gem lanterns is driven by craft insight, not visible internal contradiction; the decision to share the method with islanders arrives as gracious gesture rather than stance forced by pressure. Earned stasis is present—she stays in the garden, pouring tea among the lights—but the cost is implied, not dramatized on her body or voice in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    Amal’s survivor-grief is vivid and embodied (scarred palms on glass, the geode pressed into skin), but the turn from hunted to hunter is reported rather than dramatized; the final smile feels unmoored from any micro-choice that proves she accepts the coming devastation. Interior contradiction is asserted (“rational part…died”) rather than lived in-scene. Competence is shown (equations, array tuning) yet struggle is rhetorical, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s ex-military identity and “frequency of belonging” ache are concrete; the pilgrim remains generic. The final decision to transmit is motivated, but the interior cost is stated more than embodied. Stakes escalate cleanly, yet the pilgrim’s passivity limits relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s guilt is concrete—she returns to the shore, palms splinters—yet the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“rewrite her own conscience”) that flattens the peak beat. The micro-choice to confess is present but leans on summary, not a dramatized hinge; the cost is felt yet not embodied in a final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied: the brass pull cupped in her palm, the cold wall grooves, the decision to “untether from the narratives.” The single contradiction—professional calm versus personal guilt—drives every micro-choice; the final resolve to demand hidden histories is earned by the tactile ritual with the drawer pull. No stock phrasing; even “space between apology and forgiveness” is immediately grounded as physical territory. Voice stays individual; no diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“regret made visible,” “merrily melancholic in its decay”) and the crack-in-compass crystallizes her self-sabotage. The decisive paddle to James is earned by the memory chain and micro-choice of pocketing the cracked compass. Cost is felt: “years lost” and the broken engagement. Slight over-articulation in “this was what it meant when expectations collapse” nicks realism; still, the contradiction driving her is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s contradictory impulse—chasing a mystery she was supposed to forget—survives the memory wipe and drives every beat; the interiority stays concrete (“tasted like rust”) and her micro-choice to descend alone crystallizes values. The flaw is that Marcus’s dialogue spoon-feeds the empathy thesis, letting her renunciation lean explanatory rather than embodied, so the cost feels announced, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to human form while hungering for reunion—drives every beat; the embodied spice-smoke transformation shows cost in sensorial detail. The final line crystallizes an earned hierarchy: love > self-integrity. Minor slip: “stubbornly human” edges label-speak, but is immediately enfleshed by refusal to change.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nadia’s contradictory wants—apprehend to re-bond, climb to descend—are alive on every page; the trembling fingers, ink-stained guilt, and the traced gap that literally drives the plot all embody her cost. Interiority stays concrete (“choking beauty squeezed her chest”), never drifting into label-speak. The final micro-choice—leaving the mother-child card yet bringing back the cracked saucer—crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets inapplicable; single-POV voice remains coherent, specific, flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ren’s lifetime of pacifist guilt is rendered in concrete, body-level memory; every micro-choice (measured breath, measured step) is tethered to the ship’s failing air and their own refusal to fight. The contradictory impulse—passivity vs. the need to act—peaks when stitching strangers’ grief to their own, making the final weightless passage feel earned rather than ascribed. Interiority stays particular: “salt crystals catching light like tiny galaxies” is a perception only this caretaker-of-ghosts would notice. Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: they will never again walk a deck under normal gravity, yet that forfeiture is accepted on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical and concrete—“volcanic sand… sharp, recent, still being born”—but the decisive release of the bugs is driven more by prophecy than by earned, contradictory impulse; the pivot from control to surrender feels narrated rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s calmly inventive trait is shown, not told, through her sundial coding and the bronze-holder logistics; inner contradictions (guard duty vs. rebel engineer) tighten every beat. The blackout moment crystallizes her risk tolerance with a smile—embodied, not labeled. Only micro-gap: we never feel the physical cost (sweat, tremor) while she kneels in the dark; that keeps her just short of visceral flaw-legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaela’s contradiction—survival-through-elusiveness versus the promise-driven need to be found—remains interior and abstract; we see her place rocks, but no micro-choice visibly risks that elusivity. The climactic “tears on her face” is declared, not embodied, so the cost feels foreshadowed rather than felt. Still, her eel-herder kinesis, undulating instead of walking, is a vivid, body-level quirk that never relaxes into stock phrasing, and her final decision to teach rather than hide lands as credible endurance. Cap stays just below 8.3 because the decisive change is not dramatized in a beat that costs her safety on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid (“furiously tranquil” stance), embodied emotion strong, micro-choices (developing negatives, opening envelope) legible. Motivation consistent but final beat stays observational—no decisive renunciation or visible cost beyond trust, so closure feels contemplative rather than crucible-tested. No second character on page; relationship bullet skipped. Still, contradiction between fury-tranquil drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theodora’s mechanical-arm micro-choices (catching the blade between fingers, gentle cleaning) embody her philosopher-tinker duality with visible cost; the interiority stays specific, not diagnostic. Her refusal to finish the sundial is a credible renunciation that forecloses safety. Venn’s curiosity cracks her diplomatic mask, but the beat is told, not shown, so the relationship shift feels reported rather than lived. No internal contradiction is dramatized on the page, capping the arc just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The penny-poet’s molting identity is dramatized in the first paragraph (name-switch, “Iris in March”) and paid off when he decides “maybe I’ll stay Solomon” while cradling seedlings inside the ruined library; the interior contradiction between flight and rootedness is embodied, not labeled. Marcus’s parole-scarred hands and quiet “blooming resistance” line give him equal weight as crucible, forcing the renunciation of shape-shifting. The letters mulched into soil literalize the cost of abandoning the past, making the choice irreversible and scaled to the piece’s lyric arc. Only micro-slip: “molts personalities monthly like a snake” is a stock simile amid otherwise fresh perception.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s wistful/strategic duality is shown through the hidden composition and the decision to play only his own work; the frozen-then-ticking clock embodies paternal absence and reclaimed agency. Interiority stays concrete (“welded his scattered pieces together”) and the final renunciation costs him the safety of anonymity. The mother remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is waived; solo-POV rules apply. One hairline slip: “surprise fate itself with an unplanned encore” edges toward label-speak, but the next sentence re-embodies it in the encore decision.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “luminous doubt” is embodied in trembling hands and soil under fingernails. The contradictory impulse to believe vs. measure is kept alive in scene, not summary. Yet the micro-choice to plant is solitary; no relational crucible tests her, so the full 9-band “cost on the page” is slightly blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s grief-anchored interiority is vivid and embodied; the sixteen-year-old memory of feigned sleep is a sharp, character-specific wound. Takeshi functions more as oracle than crucible—his bonsai-tutor identity declared but never exercised under pressure—so relationship dynamics stay static. The forgiveness uttered to wind is credible renunciation, yet the compass-and-lace epiphany feels slightly therapy-adjacent (“I forgive us both”) rather than earned through a visible micro-choice in scene. Still, contradictory impulses (rage vs. yearning) coexist believably inside her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her scientific rigor clashes with emergent humility, shown through micro-choices like photographing dust instead of cleaning it. Her transformation avoids epiphanic cliché; the final decision to leave dust on her palms is a quiet renunciation of control, earned by weeks of observation. The mother’s off-page presence exerts pressure without melodrama. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (crumbling wing, layered sediment).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scarred hands, adaptive will, and glass-artist perception shape every thought. Her motivation evolves organically from survival to purpose without epiphanic shortcuts. The realization that she was “geography” lands with emotional credibility because it emerges from pattern recognition, not exposition. Final choice to testify and rebuild feels earned through consistent character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her silence isn’t passive but active creation. Her micro-choices (positioning sensors, striking the tuning fork) reveal a hierarchy of values: transforming trauma into art over “rectifying” it. The contradiction between loss and discovery pulses through every gesture. Claire’s presence deepens stakes without overshadowing Marina’s singular arc.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Meridian’s interiority is concrete and particular—her pruning shears, slow movements, and decades of misplaced burial rites reveal a deeply embodied flaw. Her inadvertent stubbornness isn’t stated but dramatized through action and regret. The contradiction between her duty and her error fuels credible emotional progression without therapy-speak. Her final renunciation (becoming eternal keeper) forecloses her old life with visible cost: isolation, transformation, and permanent threshold existence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s gently persistent trait manifests through concrete micro-choices—midnight runs, anonymous giving—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost (depleted savings, physical exhaustion). Her internal contradiction—reluctant leadership versus deep communal care—is embodied without diagnostic self-awareness. The climax earns her renunciation of secrecy not as epiphany but as tactical evolution rooted in prior action. Young Sasha’s challenge (“Why didn’t you just tell us?”) tests her motive and yields a response grounded in experiential logic, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her spiritual curiosity, breath-focused patience, and past-life disorientation feel specific, not diagnostic. The elderly woman’s panic breathing and withheld grief are rendered through physical cues, not labels. Their micro-choices (breathing together, adjusting the crystal) reveal hierarchies of value with quiet cost. No safety-hedging: Marina’s epiphany emerges from action, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s motivation—to discover time’s texture—is embodied in every action, from tracing curves to clutching fading photographs. Her retrocognition isn’t just stated; it distorts perception (“yesterday, last month, centuries ago, all at once”) and drives her into the maze with palpable urgency. The final dissolution feels earned: not a leap, but the logical terminus of her obsession. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority; emotion lives in trembling fingers, pulsing photos, disintegrating edges.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—planting resilience—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (decoding keys, clutching seeds) and internal contradictions (urgency vs. restraint). Her chained grace reveals a hierarchy of values: preservation over escape. The soldier’s choice at the climax reflects her earned influence without sentimentality. Final renunciation of isolation (“not alone anymore”) is causally rooted in prior endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her synesthetic perception, grief, and professional ethos intertwine without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (e.g., imprinting her cells into the silver) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The cancer subplot deepens motivation without melodrama, and her flawed endurance—working while dying—fuels credible renunciation. Final action feels earned by prior causality: she transmutes trauma into repair, not cure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—“to press your ear against destiny’s door”—is rooted in a flaw (hoarding illuminated moments) that crystallizes into earned wisdom. Her final renunciation (“Now she would be a witness”) forecloses her thief identity with palpable cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“luminous disbelief washed through Mira’s chest”). The elderly woman’s arrival tests Mira’s transformation, making the change credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her glassblowing rhythm, narration habit, and tactile engagement with the bookmark reveal layered contradictions: isolation vs. performance, fragility vs. control. Her motivation (“craft safe zones for inquiry”) emerges organically through action, not exposition. The final sketching beat shows credible endurance with felt cost—the “weighty lightness” in her chest mirrors the story’s emotional calculus. No diagnostic label-speak; even epiphanies arise from molten silica and meltwater.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, adaptive will, and manufactured phobias reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (stepping back, pressing the shell) align with a hierarchy of values forged under pressure. Carson’s presence sharpens status dynamics, and her final stance crystallizes from prior causality. The twin revelation lands as earned comprehension, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s motivation—rooted in reverence, obsession, and existential urgency—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions with the booklet and environment. Her internal contradiction (abandoning security for esoteric truth) manifests in micro-choices like retreating to the hearth then stepping back into the wind. The final act of writing is earned by prior observation and emotional buildup, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; her understanding emerges through sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    J-7’s interiority is precise and embodied—its synthetic perception of warmth in ice, the “processing quicken[ing],” and the epiphany about thought as accumulation feel earned, not diagnostic. The trait “remarkably composed” operates as both constraint and enabler, culminating in Earned Stasis: sweeping continues, but with transformed understanding. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly focalized through sensory and conceptual filters unique to an AI janitor. The final renunciation of linear origin myths carries conceptual cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her hesitation, moral uncertainty, and eventual resolve arise from specific sensory cues (ticket stubs, projector lens) rather than abstraction. Viktor’s confession via doodles reveals a credible, flawed psyche without safety-hedging. Their micro-choices (eavesdropping, producing the lens, speaking plainly) expose hierarchies of value with visible cost: Mira risks professional isolation; Viktor surrenders his curated identity. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution—Viktor crumples, doesn’t repent cleanly—and voice distinction in dialogue (Elena’s firmness vs. Viktor’s fragility) sharpens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—pride in hidden victories clashes with fear of dismissal, embodied through tactile interactions with marbles and hedges. Her micro-choices (ceasing care, polishing marbles) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: professional ruin risked to prove an unmeasurable truth. Marcus serves as effective secondary pressure without diluting focus. The final renunciation of algorithmic validation is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Renna’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her grease-stained fingers, secret experiments, and fear of being “just a mechanic” reveal layered motivation. Her contradiction (duty vs. discovery) plays out in micro-choices: obeying Voss yet persisting in her work. Voss’s “mechanically warm” demeanor subtly shifts from professional courtesy to awe, credibly altering their dynamic. The final renunciation of invisibility (“You’re a scientist”) feels earned, not bestowed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Celeste’s interiority is vividly embodied—her attraction to “in-between spaces” manifests in micro-choices (wading into a condemned building, tracing water-damaged notation) that feel consistent and deeply personal. Her motivation arises organically from dormant creativity and professional history, not exposition. The final decision to embrace Magdalena’s silent music is earned through her lived experience in the pit, with the cost being the abandonment of conventional musical practice. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her guilt, grief, and professional self-reckoning are embodied in trembling hands, smudged ink, and recalibrated sensors. Her contradictory impulses (certainty vs. doubt, duty vs. penance) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final choice—to forecast from the margins—is earned by her fever-confession and tactile interaction with Eva’s illustration. Chen’s minimal presence serves only to pressure her resolve, not dilute it.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s skepticism, exhaustion, and methodical recklessness are embodied through precise micro-choices—crouching to examine the valve wheel, trusting her drowsy alertness—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction (skeptic drawn to guilt-driven hauntings) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final decision to pursue justice emerges credibly from her established traits and prior causality, with the cost of inherited trauma made tangible. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatness mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—witnessing change without judgment—is embodied in her micro-choices (e.g., refolding the swan, placing the obsidian stone) and consistent interiority. Her flaw (“grips reality loosely”) enables endurance rather than action, credibly foreclosing preservationist impulses with felt cost: she forgets moments even as she records them. Emotion is conveyed through tactile perception (mossy books, cool stone) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—letting the library transform beyond her understanding—is earned by decades of quiet observation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mrs. Chen and Diane’s emotional arcs are embodied with specificity—the golden curl, the phone-lowering, the tactile reunion—avoiding therapy-speak. Maya’s interiority remains consistent but secondary, serving as catalyst rather than focalizer. The mother-daughter dynamic shows contradictory impulses (Diane’s distracted efficiency vs. buried longing) resolved through micro-choices under eclipse pressure. However, Maya’s own motivation lacks friction or cost, slightly flattening her role beyond facilitator.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The historian’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., reading pages like braille, pressing her palm to the wall). Her motivation—collecting ambient memory—is consistent and deepened by Caroline’s diary.

Her micro-choice to keep writing despite revelation (“maybe this time… or maybe not”) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: mystery over control.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Father Micah’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his quiet authority versus ecclesiastical marginalization, his faith in silence as weaponized theology. His micro-choices (recording breath mid-exhale, drawing with white paint) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in philosophical rigor, not dogma. Elena’s possession is credibly partial, her return to self earned by the rhetorical pressure that exploits the entity’s flawed ontology. Both characters feel specific, not archetypal, and their interaction under pressure crystallizes a coherent moral stance without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through rediscovering “the filament of hush”—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits (deafness, teaching, tactile perception) and intensifies credibly into high-stakes action. Her internal conflict between mechanical instruction and soulful connection manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous impulses: she builds drums while forbidding students to play them. The final renunciation isn’t a tidy fix but an earned endurance that forecloses surface-world pedagogy with visible cost: she becomes a guide underground, abandoning conventional teaching. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in vibration, stone, and silence.

Their dialogue reveals distinct worldviews without diagnostic label-speak, and the rope becomes a charged proxy for their shared struggle with impossible choice. The final renunciation isn’t tidy; it’s a trembling co-recognition that reality must be woven, not measured.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is richly contradictory—she genuinely cares yet maintains professional detachment, and her micro-choices (e.g., pressing the blotter petal, filing it afterward) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her flaw—eroding her own authenticity through counterfeit emotions—is dramatized, not diagnosed, and culminates in an Earned Stasis that forecloses emotional honesty for herself while enabling others’ relief.

The only slight softness: Marlena’s epiphany borders on tidy but is anchored by the locket photo and her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sculptor’s motivation—belonging through art—is embodied in tactile choices (weaving reeds, joining searches) and deepened by specific losses shared with the community. Her “boldly sympathetic” outreach feels earned, not performative, and her final realization emerges from accumulated interactions, not epiphany. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through action (“warmth in her chest,” “fragments” of backstory).

Her internal contradiction—exhaustion versus compulsive creation—is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. The three survivors each exert distinct pressure: the net-mender’s trembling ritualism, the coat-wearer’s wry fatalism, the silent one’s opacity—all filtered through the painter’s haggard perception.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)

The final whisper is earned by prior causality: her shift from volume to vulnerability flows directly from Silas’s lesson and the vial’s symbolic function. Vera’s presence crystallizes the relational crucible without flattening either woman into archetype.

His motivation—to unravel cosmic illusions—deepens into a realization that he *is* the paradox needing resolution.

    The woman’s desperation is embodied in her clutching the satchel and cracked voice; the coachman’s quiet wisdom emerges through micro-choices like waiting for the gutters to stop. Both characters reveal contradictory impulses—her urgency versus his patience—and their dialogue exposes layered histories without exposition. The yarn needle functions as both object and metaphor, grounding internal conflict in tactile action. Their interaction feels authentic, with distinct voices and status dynamics that subtly shift as understanding deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    The potter’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—her zen emerges through tactile choices (offering water, speaking to trees) rather than abstraction. Her motivation (“to understand why some places resist change”) intensifies into active care, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses her departure until the oasis is honored. Contradictory impulses—observation vs. intervention—resolve organically through micro-choices. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in posture, breath, and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “wistfully pragmatic acceptance” manifests in micro-choices (tucking the brass tooth, descending silently) that align with her grandmother’s legacy. Her motivation intensifies credibly from personal grief to communal responsibility without over-articulation. The children function as a collective pressure point rather than individuated characters, which suits the story’s scope. Final renunciation of hiding is earned through prior causality and carries the cost of exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—drowning memory, brittle awakenings, reconstructed body—and her micro-choices (avoiding the cartography wing, then entering it) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her transformation from isolation to chosen coexistence feels earned through concrete struggle, not epiphany. The quagga rescue and thylacine howl subtly externalize internal shifts without sentimentality. Flaws like disorientation and vulnerability compound credibly before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mei Lin’s interiority is vividly embodied—her weathered satchel, the precise count of letters, her tactile hesitation before release—all revealing a woman whose identity is entwined with secrecy and stewardship. Her final choice to relinquish the letters is earned through Jun’s parallel arc and the storm’s symbolic rupture, carrying palpable cost: the end of her role as sole keeper. Contradictory impulses—preservation versus release—act simultaneously in her hands as she ties each letter to the spiral. The micro-choice to teach Jun to write his own letter crystallizes her transformation without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her cautious hope wars with dread, embodied in trembling hands and blurred vision. Her motivation (to disrupt cosmic manipulation) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a high-stakes act with visible cost: risking equipment, reputation, and sanity. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her epiphany emerges through action, not therapy-speak. Final endurance (marking charts amid chaos) earns Charged Poise with legible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and prudently adventurous nature drive concrete micro-choices under pressure—she forces focus on geometry over panic, traces the spiral despite terror, and endures spatial mutiny to claim the key. Her internal contradiction (fear vs. fascination) is embodied throughout, not summarized. The final renunciation of safety for knowledge feels earned, with cost legible in her shaking legs and gasping breath. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the engine of her perception and moral project; her motivation—to awaken empathy through portraiture of absence—is embodied in micro-choices (examining the ribbon, descending into the quarry, sketching the killer’s loneliness). Her internal contradiction (artist who cannot see faces yet sees deeper truths) drives every action. The final decision to paint the killer’s “hollow ache” rather than seek justice feels earned, with visible cost: she trades resolution for mercy, reinforcing her core wound as both limitation and gift.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “nervously confident” ascent, inherited frustration, and spongey dread feel specific and contradictory. Dr. Yoon’s gaunt brightness and tremor reveal ostracized competence without exposition. Their micro-choices (bringing the nail, retrieving the scope) align with motives rooted in legacy and exile. The final collaboration earns its hope through shared stakes, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maria’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her “dynamically observant” trait manifests in micro-choices (e.g., scanning the pullout, recounting names rhythmically) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her motivation (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) is dramatized through action, not assertion, and culminates in a Charged Poise closure where bearing witness becomes both cost and calling. The hitchhiker’s absence paradoxically deepens Maria’s agency rather than diminishing it.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Luka’s interiority is precise and contradictory: he embodies both the calm of a COO and the inherited hunger of a highway robber’s son. His micro-choices—placing stones not to exclude others but to anchor himself—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; his self-awareness emerges through tactile interaction with the train, the money, and the landscape. His final commitment to stay is earned by prior causality and carries the weight of renouncing his predatory past.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her lucid dream expertise informs her perception without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choice to interrupt Kove (“Sit with me”) reveals a hierarchy of values (connection over isolation) with immediate emotional cost. Kove’s guilt and exhaustion are rendered through concrete gestures (trembling fingers, sinking into a chair), not summary. Their dynamic evolves credibly under pressure, culminating in shared labor that reconfigures both their stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s guardedness is embodied in precise micro-choices—stepping on impossible lily pads, unbending her defenses only at cost—and her flaw (emotional armor) directly enables and complicates the resolution. Her motivation (“find what mirrors refuse to reveal”) is consistent with her established gift and drives every action. The confession-vision reveals not just plot but her personal risk: truth demands vulnerability she resists. Final renunciation of safety for truth feels earned, with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her paralysis, expanded consciousness, and “anxious elation” feel specific and contradictory. Her motivation (to find the intersection) stems credibly from past trauma and visions. The micro-choice to hold up the topiary clipping catalyzes group action, revealing hierarchy of values. However, secondary characters remain archetypal (eyeless seer, prophetic child), limiting relational depth despite clear choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s reckless idealism and internal contradiction—wanting to patch souls while tearing her own open—are embodied in micro-choices (clutching the card, trailing fingers on bark) and culminate in a final decision that forecloses safety with visible cost. Kael’s anguish is specific, not archetypal, and his request forces Mira into a morally complex reversal of her life’s work. Their dialogue reveals status shifts: he once trembled in her hands; now he grips her wrist with “dusky resolve.” The flaw of overconfidence is consistent, costly, and never hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is embodied and specific—his shame, expertise, and emotional insulation feel lived-in, not diagnostic. His micro-choices (avoiding eye contact, retreating into data) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The daughter’s presence pressures him toward empathy without breaking character. His final act—tacking the cloth to the wall—is a credible renunciation of perfectionism that forecloses his old need for certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Asha’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “kindly methodical” nature manifests in patient ritual, embodied grief (“preferred that phrase to the clinical alternatives”), and micro-choices like planting the seed with Akkadian words. Her motivation intensifies credibly from inherited duty to epiphany, and her final comprehension feels earned, not diagnostic. The story avoids therapy-speak; emotions arise through tactile actions (patting earth, watching leaves unfurl). Her flaw—stubborn patience—is both enabler and cost, foreclosing quicker paths but making the eventual breakthrough resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, purpose, and shifting identity pulse through tactile detail (“titan-gear settled against her spine,” “wintersun serenity bright and cold”). Her motivation—to preserve wonder amid entropy—is dramatized through micro-choices: retrieving the creel, feeding pages into the basin, accepting fluid identity. The final renunciation of fixed selfhood feels earned by prior action, not declared. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act simultaneously (“librarian and fisher both”).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her duty wars with her empathy, embodied in tactile hesitation (“heartbeat of her hesitation”) and culminating in a micro-choice (etching her own shell) that reconfigures her identity. Her emotional shift avoids therapy-speak; the epiphany arises from handling shells, not abstraction. The final self-crowning carries visible cost: she violates protocol, risking professional consequence. Motivation intensifies organically from cataloguer to participant, rooted in consistent traits of observation and latent longing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, precision, and avoidance manifest through tactile actions (patched accordion, map notations) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final choice to play the accordion is earned by prior causality: each river documented was penance leading to this reckoning. The cost—facing the site of her brother’s death—is felt in her chest cracking open at the graffiti. Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs. self-punishment) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—eagerness to uncover truth versus fear of drowning in silence—are embodied through tactile choices (veil, watch, frantic writing) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation is rooted in trauma (“the Incident”) and sharpened by present stakes, with micro-choices (ascending the staircase, documenting despite risk) revealing a hierarchy of values. The Librarian functions as pressure, not plot device, and Elena’s final act of writing a letter to her past self crystallizes agency without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Iris’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “mulberry ache,” the tactile tension of coffee stains and ice crystal, and her moral struggle feel specific and urgent. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion, preservation vs. propagation) operate simultaneously in scene, not as abstract summaries. The final choice—to authenticate while secretly disseminating the design—is earned through escalating micro-choices and consistent with her established ethics. Kemble’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening either character.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: to honor the dead by capturing their final spark. Her interiority is embodied through tactile, profession-specific perception—calluses, spine curvature, finger posture—and never lapses into diagnostic abstraction. The micro-choice to style the weaver’s hair as she wore it at twenty reveals a hierarchy of values (authenticity over convention) with emotional cost. No secondary characters dilute focus; her solitude intensifies the ritual’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, forgiveness, and resolve manifest through tactile details (the hairpin), micro-choices (leading the soul to the Pool), and contradictions (forgiveness vs. lingering pain). Her final act—showing the hairpin—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. The antagonist soul’s limited presence functions effectively as a crucible without overcomplicating choreography. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her role as “conscience for hire” manifests in micro-choices (e.g., unwrapping the shard only after Keegan’s plea) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Keegan’s arc avoids therapy-speak; his vulnerability emerges through embodied gestures (“head in his hands”) and vocal shifts, not diagnostic labels. Both characters remain genuinely flawed without safety-hedging: Mara’s certainty about doubt itself risks becoming dogma, while Keegan’s self-deception stems from professional pride, not cartoonish villainy. The final renunciation—“wear it”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: his identity as a scientist must be rebuilt.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maia’s internal conflict—between desire for invisibility and the need to exist fully—is embodied in her breath, posture, and stone-dropping gesture, not summarized. Keiran’s backwards aging isn’t a gimmick; it fuels his pedagogy and culminates in his youthful face mirroring hers, making their shared epiphany viscerally earned. Both characters reveal hierarchy of values through micro-choices: Maia’s withheld presence, Keiran’s deliberate withholding of answers. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotions arise from concrete perception (“breath catch,” “sycamore hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The harmonic stone skimmer’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and resonant metaphor, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—rooted in historical reverence and a commitment to stillness—is consistent and intensifies meaningfully when confronted with the arrowhead’s pulse.

Her endurance constitutes Earned Stasis, foreclosing active movement forever but gaining communal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Teryn’s motivation—rooted in her grandmother’s philosophy and her rejection of automated magic—is embodied through concrete actions (carrying the keystone, mist walking) and internal contradictions (pride vs. shame, tradition vs. progress). Her micro-choices (unstrapping at the cloudline, stepping into mist) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: social exile, physical strain, and emotional vulnerability. The final renunciation of Academy validation is earned by prior causality and crystallized in the keystone’s placement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“muscles burning,” “light that refused to forget”).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s synesthetic inheritance and grief are embodied with precise sensory detail—foghorn blasts sparking crimson, bell chimes in violet—and his motivation is rooted in tangible loss (the key tag, the journals). His final choice to return to lamplighting as an act of witness feels earned, not sentimental, and carries the cost of accepting mystery over resolution. The internal contradiction between scientific yearning and emotional surrender operates simultaneously in the climax. No diagnostic label-speak mars the interiority; even his mother’s epiphanies are filtered through his limited, yearning perception.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with coins, the tension between stellar doubt and quiet enthusiasm, and her micro-choices (casting lots, tuning frequencies) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to witness and translate backwards prophecies—is earned through consistent action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief manifests through tactile interaction with the atlas, the blade, and light, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her contradictory impulses (reaping without naming vs. yearning to reclaim meaning) collide in real time during the naming ritual. The final choice—to carry crystallized fears forward—is earned by her daughter’s echoed voice reframing sacrifice, not imposed epiphany. Micro-choices (pressing the blade, speaking names) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her “brittle devotion” coexists with earnest hope, and her micro-choices (collecting dew, rebuilding the clapper) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by perceived cosmic responsibility. Her flaw—lukewarm magic—is not a gimmick but a lived constraint that informs every action. The final choice to ring the bell feels earned because it emerges from weeks of precise, vulnerable labor, not sudden insight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in timing, touch, and trembling resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)

Final renunciation of bureaucratic compliance is earned by prior causality and weighted by personal legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s internal contradiction—rigorous empiricism versus suppressed intuition—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., using silver tweezers, speaking forbidden words) and layered with sentimental vulnerability that never tips into diagnostic self-awareness. Her final act synthesizes these impulses credibly, with visible cost: the relinquishing of control required to complete her life’s work. The locket and journal fragments ground her secrecy in tactile detail rather than exposition. No epiphany feels unearned; transformation arises from sustained pressure, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her doubt wars with muscle memory, her fear of failure with duty.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kenji’s internal conflict—between numbness and the desire to feel—is embodied with precision, not abstraction. His micro-choices (withdrawing opposition, recognizing his clone as complement) emerge from layered emotional contradiction, not tidy logic.

Final renunciation (“brothers”) carries visible cost: surrendering legal exclusivity to claim shared humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miranda’s interiority is vivid and particular—her receptivity to signs, her fear of corporate erasure, and her reverence for mystery feel embodied rather than declared. Her micro-choices (planting the seed at night, weaving the bloom into puzzles) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she risks obscurity to preserve authenticity. The mentor’s posthumous gift retroactively deepens her motivation without undermining prior causality. However, her emotional state remains slightly too coherent under stress—minimal contradiction or irrationality tempers full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation is rooted in specific, embodied grief—his trembling grip on the pull cord, his memory of Emma’s laughter—and his actions arise from a credible, flawed hope. His internal contradiction (eager yet mournful) manifests physically and drives micro-choices: scattering leaves, humming lullabies, conducting machines. The brother and mother’s reactions are filtered through Marcus’s perception, avoiding head-hopping while showing relational pressure. Final cost is felt: not healing, but a fragile crack in silence, earned by his ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guardian’s interiority is vividly embodied—her feral posture, eroded memory, and evolving relationship to uncertainty feel specific and lived-in. Her final choice to don the pendant and resume librarianship emerges organically from prior micro-choices (e.g., ceasing tallies, interiorizing exteriors). The contradiction between human longing and animal adaptation pulses throughout without tidy resolution. Cost is visible: she carries dimensional homesickness rather than curing it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—“hope calcified into habit,” her stoic sensitivity resisting surrender—culminating in a renunciation that forecloses her Royal Metallurgist destiny with palpable cost. Her micro-choice to plunge the crozier embodies a hierarchy of values: creation over compliance, improvisation over dogma. The final staff’s “awareness” reflects earned transformation, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion is embodied in trembling wood and luminous grain.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is rooted in a poetic yet consistent worldview—“endings were simply beginnings viewed from the wrong angle”—which drives her unconventional method of listening to silence. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile interaction with the fragment (“serenely electric surface,” “static whispers”). The final renunciation isn’t of action but of noise, an Earned Stasis that forecloses commercial interpretation in favor of cosmic listening, with the cost being solitude and obscurity. Her flaw—prioritizing signal over human connection—is implied but not over-explained, keeping her individualized and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s motivation—stubborn hope rooted in ritual—is embodied through micro-choices (ticket-checking, radio tuning) and consistent interiority. His “resiliently positive” trait avoids sentimentality by being tested against three years of failure. The final act of broadcasting names emerges credibly from accumulated observation, not epiphany. Cost is visible in Captain Reeves’s fragility and the passengers’ disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s motivation—rooted in grief and the search for connection through her brother’s disappearance—is embodied in every action, especially her meticulous weaving. Her internal contradiction (rational architect vs. desperate sister) manifests physically in the sinew thread’s tension and the gallery’s distortions. The final choice to accept a “realistically imaginary” brother as real is earned by her prior logic and emotional buildup. No diagnostic label-speak; her schizophrenia reference is contextualized through loss, not clinical detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Yael’s motivation—reconnecting with ancestral navigation to bridge human and alien understanding—is rooted in her professional identity and internal contradiction: rigor versus wonder. Her micro-choices (handling the chain, requesting surface assignment) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: leaving Thalassa, abandoning her students. Reeves functions as a precise pressure point, not a foil, crystallizing Yael’s resolve without diluting agency. The “balancedly curious” trait manifests as embodied tension, not label-speak, especially in her tactile engagement with the chain link.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s claustrophobia and loyalty are embodied in visceral detail (“throat close,” “vision narrow”) and drive micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation—recovering her sister’s erased legacy—is consistent, costly, and deepened by the codex annotations.

Final endurance (returning tide after tide) is earned through prior causality and charged with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his heartbeat counting, ink ritual, and porcelain shard handling reveal a psyche reconstructing itself through tactile, numerically anchored rituals.

Final renunciation of counting feels earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in copper veins, humming stones, and starling patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)

The mother’s voice catalyzes transformation, not exposition, preserving character-bound knowledge and flawed authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation—to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world—is embodied through consistent, high-stakes choices: playing despite danger, pressing the locust shell to her violin, leading the orchard to freedom.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are channeled through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)

His micro-choices (pausing for drones, handing over the bottle) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he risks arrest to sustain human connection. Mira’s brief but potent presence functions as a crucible, crystallizing Kael’s mission without diluting focus. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (“cradling it,” “brittle hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The carpenter’s silence is embodied, not declared—her humming emerges as a physical inevitability after years of wordless restoration. Her micro-choices (left instead of right, polishing the halo last) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reverence for broken beauty. The final act of singing while cranking the carousel fuses internal transformation with external action without epiphany or therapy-speak. Cost is felt in the seven-year void now breached—not explained, but sung.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—her trembling hands, the selection of aureolin, photographing the palette itself—all reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief and devotion. Her motivation stems from consistent traits (attentiveness, interpretive longing) and intensifies credibly toward renunciation that becomes understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interior conflict—between maternal duty and artistic longing—is rendered with visceral specificity, especially in her trembling admission about the symphony she “locked away.” Her micro-choice to bring the lock of hair, and later accept the locksmith’s challenge, reveals a hierarchy of values reshaped by embodied fear and regret. The locksmith’s minimal but precise actions (e.g., placing the hair in the astrolabe-music box) exert calibrated pressure without overshadowing Mara’s arc. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from disorientation, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her chronic curiosity, fear, and scholarly rigor shape every action. Her choice to re-engage with the fairy ring isn’t just emotional but epistemological, rooted in decades of lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—defiance and desperation, impatience and yearning—are embodied in gesture (“draining her cup as if it were a challenge”) and micro-choices (mirroring Miren’s backward walk). Miren’s flaws are equally lived: her nervous retreats, sharp tenderness, and past exiles inform every line. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their growth emerges through action, not exposition. The final choice—to carry the shadow-glass into dusk—is earned by the mapped tea leaves and mirrored behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Esme’s motivation—preserving wonder—is embodied through precise, character-specific actions (e.g., grafting essences, kneeling on wet stone).

Minor deduction: internal conflict leans more toward resolve than contradiction, slightly softening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, accumulated silences, and unfinished mask reveal a psyche shaped by failure and quiet endurance.

Both characters operate within consistent moral and emotional frameworks that drive irreversible decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception—her “methodically curious” nature manifests in frame-by-frame analysis, not exposition. Her final recommendation emerges from accumulated observation, not epiphany, and carries the cost of professional vulnerability (exposing an “archaeological wound”). The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her emotional arc is conveyed through micro-choices like enhancing footage or choosing dawn to submit.

The ghost functions as a mirror rather than a second character, so relationship dynamics aren’t required. Her final act of encoding prayers reconfigures her artistic purpose, foreclosing solitude with visible emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and particular—her grief, loyalty, and curiosity manifest through embodied choices (fitting goggles, clutching diary) rather than abstraction. Her “warmly inquisitive” nature isn’t labeled but shown in remembered dialogue and present attention. The final renunciation—accepting Thessaly’s hollowed form while preserving her encrypted joy—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic self-awareness; emotion arises from action and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—proving empty spaces remember—is rooted in grief and professional conviction, driving every micro-choice (adjusting the telescope, cataloguing absences). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied through tactile interaction with Victor’s oxidized fingerprints and spectral light. Contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. poetic belief—coexist without resolution, deepening authenticity. Final renunciation isn’t of belief but of isolation: she’ll present findings, accepting professional risk as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but the engine of her interior conflict—her faith in measurement over perception drives every choice. Her micro-decisions (photographing the coin, tucking it away, resolving to paint from memory) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth through method, not sight. The final act—painting the custodian despite blindness—is earned by prior causality and carries the quiet cost of lifelong limitation transformed into discipline. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in tactile gestures (fingertips on canvas, coin warming against ribs).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s curiosity drives every micro-choice—from tracing chalk to reversing the hopscotch sequence—and her sociable isolation is embodied in precise gestures (e.g., clutching the phrasebook, noting starling counts). Her motivation intensifies under pressure without melodrama, and her final act forecloses passive observation for active discovery with tangible cost: irreversible commitment to uncharted knowledge. The captain serves as effective secondary pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Celeste’s internal contradiction—precision without understanding—is embodied in her tactile engagement with gears and frost, not summarized. Her micro-choices (spreading gears, uncapping the vial) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from technical mastery to empathetic repair. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring insight in sensory convergence: light, reflection, and sound coalesce into “the rhythm of repair.” Final renunciation of hollow expertise carries felt cost—twenty years reframed as apprenticeship.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mirela’s motivation—rooted in wartime loss and maternal care—is embodied through precise, ghostly actions (writing chalk messages, ringing the bell) that escalate meaningfully under pressure. Kess’s arc mirrors this with visceral specificity: her hoarding, weeping, and opening her storehouse feel earned, not illustrative. Both characters exhibit contradictory impulses (fear vs. generosity, duty vs. exhaustion) without diagnostic self-awareness.

The final renunciation—becoming part of the pattern—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: her dissolution into silence. Contradictory impulses (desire to preserve vs. acceptance of oblivion) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her hatred of the orchard, resentment toward her aunt, and reluctant compassion feel specific and contradictory. Her micro-choices (hovering steps, guiding hikers) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: she cannot leave because doing so would abandon others to transformation. The epiphany—that her aunt trapped her not out of spite but necessity—is earned through action, not exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through tactile perception (“nut grew warm,” “paths responded”).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)

    Mira’s motivation—seeking the origin of stories through the archaeology of forgetting—is embodied in every action, from uncorking moonlight to mapping incisions. Her internal contradiction (vendor of forgetting who believes in understanding before erasure) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The diamond stylus and bottled moonlight aren’t props but extensions of her moral calculus. Her final exit enacts Earned Stasis: she foregoes interaction with arriving visitors, bearing the cost of invisibility to preserve the library’s fragile truth.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “sturdy” yet “brittle” heart, the chef’s discipline repurposed for emotional alchemy, and micro-choices (unwrapping hands, sorting memories by flavor) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Her flaw (contagious empathy) directly shapes her method and cost. The final renunciation—carrying only her own memories—is earned through sustained, tactile struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through sensory metaphor rooted in her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s “empathetically decisive” nature drives every micro-choice, from learning Tigrinya to silencing her song to speak plainly—a flawlessly embodied contradiction of vigor and tenderness. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing itself through tactile action (winding the weight, adjusting volumes) and linguistic risk. The child’s solo from Elevator Seven crystallizes her earned cost: trust cannot be broadcast but must be coaxed into existence. No head-hopping; all pressure flows through her single, vivid POV.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s helix-mindedness is concretely embodied in her perception and choices, not merely labeled.

No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies; her contradictions emerge through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her identity as a “symphonically minded” artist who perceives vibration as music, and her bleeding fingers during the strumming climax embody both physical cost and unwavering commitment. Her internal contradiction—grieving sound while inventing a new form of music—drives every action without slipping into diagnostic self-awareness. The hedgehog’s closing dream subtly mirrors her impact, reinforcing her purpose without sentimentality. Every micro-choice (salvaging porcelain, analyzing cracks) reveals a hierarchy of values centered on preserving beauty through empathy and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Katrin’s motivation—beauty in difficulty—is embodied through her tactile relationship with the basalt stone and her chess-trained perception, not stated abstractly. Her internal contradiction (exiled for valuing beauty, now risking everything to prove its utility) drives every micro-choice, culminating in a renunciation of exile’s shame via earned stasis. Emotions are rendered through precise physicality (“static electricity on her skin,” “thumb into the dent”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final smile-through-tears crystallizes cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcella’s pacifism, tactile intuition, and emotional contradictions are embodied through precise action—fingers stained purple, tuning frequencies instead of picking locks—and her climactic choice to witness rather than protect feels earned. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief and love manifest as vibration, warmth, molecular sensation. The revelation that Elena’s diary catalogs resilience, not trauma, reframes Marcella’s own project without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—uncovering intergenerational theft of resilience—is compellingly rooted in familial loss and sharpened by urgency. Her interiority is concrete (“stomach lurched,” “breath caught”) and avoids diagnostic labels. Micro-choices (following water, digging under time pressure) reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and profession-bound, with micro-choices—like shifting from structural to meteorological analysis—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her emotional arc intertwines flawlessly with the central mystery: competence tempered by inherited wisdom (“cultivating foresight in action”) drives every decision. The father’s patch functions as both talisman and catalyst without veering into sentimentality. Her final survey embodies Earned Stasis—enduring witness rather than rescue—with cost felt in the charged silence she now interprets.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The operator’s contradictory impulses—craving emotional authenticity yet hiding behind borrowed identities—are dramatized through embodied choices (selecting type, handling the fragment) rather than diagnostic labels. His admission “I suspect mine is incomplete” lands with visceral vulnerability, and Mira’s presence forces a crystallization of self that feels earned. The borrowed personas are not gimmicks but psychological armor with tangible cost: they distance him from his own feelings even as he seeks to map them. Final renunciation of masks (“his own uncertain hands”) reads as credible endurance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kessa’s trembling hands, embodied anxiety, and micro-choices (stopping to speak, pressing the pendant) reveal a layered interiority shaped by grief and duty. Her emotional arc—from nervous routine to steady purpose—is earned through specific interactions, not summary. The mentor’s absence functions as a living pressure, not a cliché. Final renunciation of isolation in favor of connection carries visible cost: she sacrifices efficiency for wonder, aligning with Orin’s ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath clouds, gripping the wheel, screaming into the void—and her contradictions (skeptic mystic, grief-stricken logician) drive every micro-choice. Her final acceptance isn’t epiphany but earned reconfiguration: she abandons performative doubt to embrace her mentor’s hidden truth. The prism’s warmth catalyzes a shift rooted in seventeen years of disciplined attention, not sudden revelation. Flawlessly calibrated emotional progression with tangible cost: her old worldview shatters audibly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)

    Kael’s meekness and quiet determination manifest in concrete, embodied choices—his precise tying of silk, hammer strikes despite mental fragmentation—that reveal a hierarchy of values with escalating cost. His interior contradiction (clarity vs. confusion) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries, and his emotional state degrades believably under pressure. The final renunciation—trading all memory for planetary healing—is earned by prior causality and crystallizes as Earned Stasis. No diagnostic label-speak; every loss is felt through sensory absence (“taste of fresh cider,” “father’s laugh”).

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaia’s interiority is vividly embodied—emotions manifest as sensory maps, hot stones in her chest, and tactile memories.

    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her laughter, prophetic slips, and reverence for ritual reveal a complex blend of fatalism and agency. Her motivation (shaping dawn from ancient shadows) emerges through micro-choices: cleaning the lens, aligning mirrors, inserting the wick. The glass wick and storm rituals constrain her actions meaningfully. Her accidental prophecy trait introduces credible blind spots without undermining competence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.3)

    Elara’s motivation—rekindling a dying realm through song—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly as pressure mounts. Her internal contradiction (needing cohesion to act while inherently scattered) manifests physically in drifting shards and emotionally in her sacrificial dissolution.

Every micro-choice (humming, orbiting the window, singing over settlements) reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s interiority is precise and embodied—her empathy isn’t abstract but a visceral burden that shapes her reclusion.

The woman’s ancient eyes and protective concern deepen Eleanor’s motivation without exposition. Final acceptance feels earned because her epiphany arises from tactile engagement with books, not diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Della’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her thirst for justice wars with inherited mercy, embodied in her grip on the watch fob and the recording device. Kern’s confession forces a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values: truth over vengeance. The final act of stopping the recording feels earned by her father’s legacy and the tactile weight of the heirloom. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaia’s interior conflict—skepticism versus embodied wonder—is rendered through concrete sensory detail (metallic taste, bioluminescent glow) and micro-choices (twisting the ring, removing it).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s hybrid physiology—wilting near dishonesty—is not just stated but embodied in her leaf movements, which respond instantly to emotional truth (e.g., drooping at Kade’s hollow brightness, unfurling at his confession). Her motivation—to recover lost honesty—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices: searching under floorboards, inviting Kade, etching her own truth. The relationship with Kade acts as crucible: his shift from performative cheer to vulnerability directly alters Mira’s physical and emotional state, making their dynamic causal to her arc. Final candor (“I’m afraid too, but less now”) feels earned, with visible cost in years of thinning and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation—rooted in her mother’s silence after grief—is embodied through micro-choices (arriving earlier, approaching Iris with “sandstorm calm”) and drives the narrative forward. Iris’s internal conflict is credibly rendered through physical collapse and fragmented speech, not therapy-speak. Both characters feel specific, flawed, and avoid archetype. The final renunciation of flight (Iris staying) is earned by Maya’s consistent presence, though Iris’s transformation leans slightly toward ease given the depth of her trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)

Her micro-choices (e.g., pressing the shell to the wall, singing into darkness) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the loss of her former limited role for a heavier, sacred duty.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation—to excavate truth from comfortable lies—is embodied in her micro-choices (reassembling documents, burning them) and contradicted by her final act of preserving a lie. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are shown through action (“pulse quickened,” feeding papers into the stove).

No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies mar her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s motivation crystallizes organically from embodied memory and ritual, not exposition.

Interior contradiction (isolation vs. connection) pulses beneath every action without therapeutic self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her trembling hands, jaw set against pressure—and her motivation (truth over career) intensifies credibly under threat.

    Mira’s motivation—rooted in personal loss and professional duty—is compellingly embodied through micro-choices (e.g., lying to her supervisor, using backdoors) and contradictions (preserver vs. investigator). Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; grief manifests via tactile interaction with the patch and obsessive archival digging. The final decision to extract the backups feels earned, with clear cost implied in “even if it cost her everything.” Interiority remains concrete, specific, and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her shadow-sense reveals truth yet demands vulnerability, and her calm masks deep trauma. Her micro-choices (offering the shard, guiding attention to the boys) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking rejection to forge empathy. The leaders’ emotional shifts feel earned through embodied reactions (trembling hands, cracked voice), not diagnostic labels. Their shared history surfaces through Kael’s perception, avoiding head-hopping while making their reconciliation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her shift from control to “gripping reality loosely” manifests in micro-choices (folding the parasol, hovering over cancellation) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her motivation evolves organically from euthanasia tourist to liminal witness without epiphanic rupture. The Kalaallisut grandmother’s observation crystallizes her transformation credibly, not diagnostically. Flaws like over-control are confronted through action, not label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena and Marco’s motivations are deeply rooted in generational feud, personal history, and emotional contradiction—evident when Elena burns Dimitri’s letter yet keeps its fragment. Their interiority is concrete (“passion had literally consumed reason”) and embodied through tactile interactions with the lantern, pavilion, and vineyard. The final choice—Elena staying—feels earned by prior causality and carries relational cost. Voice distinction is subtle but present: Marco’s agrarian metaphors contrast Elena’s wry skepticism (“That’s a terrible metaphor”).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation—preserving the echo of wisdom—is embodied in her willingness to sacrifice part of herself, rooted in her profession and trauma (the half-mask). Her “strange honesty” isn’t just stated but drives dialogue and choice (“truth cuts straighter paths”). The internal conflict between loss and legacy is consistent, culminating in an Earned Stasis where she accepts fragmentation of self for continuity of knowledge. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“cool material against her scarred skin”).

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s reticence, embodied trembling, and weathered innocence create a layered interiority that avoids diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—activating the crystal, recording voices, preparing to testify—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking ridicule to defend linguistic aliveness. The contradiction between scholarly caution and childlike eagerness fuels her arc without tidy resolution. Final endurance (testifying despite fear) is earned through five years of solitary decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s precognitive forgetfulness manifests in embodied contradictions—his hands remember routes his mind cannot—and Sarah’s grief-driven attentiveness creates a credible, asymmetrical relationship under pressure. Their micro-choices (Sarah holding memory like a torch, Marcus refusing to chalk the final sound) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering time’s erosion through tactile metaphors (“film dissolve,” “magnetic memory erasing”). The final renunciation—choosing not to capture the hum—is earned by prior causality and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile expertise, emotional restraint, and philosophical insight arise organically from her actions and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Richard’s contradictory impulses—urgency for reconciliation versus fear of rejection—are embodied in his trembling voice and the broken vinyl. Maya’s “decisively kind” trait drives concrete action (17 calls, recordings), not just sentiment. Linda’s emotional regression (“voice small and young”) feels earned, not performative. The final hand-hold carries cost: fifteen years lost, now irrevocably condensed into three weeks.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interior conflict—between scholarly precision and existential terror—is embodied in tactile detail (“hands trembled,” “felt translucent”) and crystallizes in her final choice. Her motivation (shadow obsession) is consistent, specific, and retroactively validated by the revelation of her own shadow-status. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions arise through action and perception under pressure. The closure choice feels earned because her entire arc orbits the noon-shadow paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s transformation from “forgiving skeptic” to believer in “stranger and more merciful” reality is embodied through precise micro-choices—kneeling, touching bones, promising not to forget—that reveal her shifting hierarchy of values under pressure. Thomas’s “shrewdly innocent” contradiction is dramatized in voice (“harmonics that made her teeth ache”) and action (casually pulling a tooth while speaking of cosmic displacement). Both characters remain flawed and bounded by knowledge: Maren never fully understands the other world, only how to help. Their relationship crystallizes around shared displacement, forcing Maren’s renunciation of certainty with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in trauma and ritual, with micro-choices (selecting, weighing, polishing) revealing a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. Her internal conflict—between memory and transformation—is embodied through tactile action, not diagnostic labels. The final placement of the white shard demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost: she remains earthbound, yet her work becomes communal light. No safety-hedging; her flaws (fixation on the past) fuel her purpose without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she admits past hatred yet chooses transformation, embodying emotional complexity without therapy-speak. The executive’s vulnerability feels earned through embodied gestures (trembling hands, collapsed shoulders) rather than exposition. Both characters’ micro-choices reveal hierarchies of value: Mira offering the pendant not as forgiveness but as shared weight; the executive accepting temporary solace without absolution. Their status reversal—from corporate power to penitent supplicant—is staged with spatial and vocal precision.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    The novelist’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief manifests through the seashell fragment, mist-dissolved self-perception, and tactile resistance to writing. Her contradiction (searching for closure while fearing its finality) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The stranger encounter triggers no epiphany but a micro-choice: to reinterpret her daughter’s absence through refracted grace. Final renunciation of reunion in favor of recognition is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maera’s motivation—restoring forgotten sacred practices—is rooted in consistent traits (tinkerer, listener of fragments) and intensifies through embodied choices: selecting tendrils, singing despite vocal imperfection, trusting ancestral fragments over certainty. Her internal contradiction—whimsy versus solemn duty—animates the ritual without tidy resolution.

Final renunciation of credit (“some magic worked best unnamed”) forecloses personal recognition with quiet cost.

No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile ritual and precise emotional contradictions—e.g., her simultaneous entrapment and purpose in boundary-less work. Her micro-choices (orienting the lamp, kneeling in silence) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: endless labor as both burden and sanctuary. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphanies arise organically from lamplight on calcified weights. Final renunciation—extinguishing the lamp—is earned by prior causality and crystallizes her role as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)

Flaws drive the arc without safety-hedging; her passivity becomes active renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina and Thomas are rendered with profound interiority, their contradictions embodied in gesture (trembling hands, satchel weight) rather than exposition. Thomas’s arc from relic-gripping to compass-holding is earned through Marina’s precise witnessing, not unearned epiphany. Their micro-choices—sitting close, pressing pen to palm—reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. The only hairline flaw: Marina’s backstory (“missed the last ship deliberately”) slightly flattens her mystery without altering present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prince’s motivation—rekindling beauty in a sterile world—is rooted in consistent, embodied longing and drives increasingly high-stakes choices, culminating in a renunciation of perfection for flawed hope. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through trembling hands, stained coats, and tears on lab equipment. The micro-choice to trade his ceremonial sword establishes hierarchy of values early, and the final cradling of the hybrid creature embodies earned endurance with visible cost: he accepts imperfection as the only viable path forward.

    Maris’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her belief in accidental orchestration clashes with her sense of being lost, and her tactile engagement with the sand reveals a shift from curated luxury to raw truth. The old woman functions as catalyst, not crucible, but Maris’s micro-choice to release the bugs earns her transformation. No diagnostic label-speak mars the epiphany; instead, understanding arrives through embodied action (“letting it run through her fingers”). Her final renunciation—of control, of intention—is legible, costly, and consistent with her arc.

    Mira’s calmly inventive nature manifests through embodied micro-choices—tracing coded angles, leveraging her sentinel access—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her internal contradiction (guardian vs. saboteur) operates simultaneously without summary, and her competence is balanced by genuine risk (Captain Voss’s near-discovery). The final Charged Poise crystallizes her renunciation of passive guardianship in favor of active revolution, foreclosing safety with legible stakes.

    Kaela’s interiority is vividly embodied—her curse manifests in flickering visions that directly impede her actions (“foreseen the tides wrong twice”), and her emotional conflict between burden and purpose crystallizes without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (e.g., shaking off visions to place rocks) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: time, safety, sanity. The transformation from “promise as burden” to “blueprint” feels earned through prior struggle, not epiphany.

    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “furiously tranquil” state manifests in precise micro-choices (developing photos, timing exposures) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation—to map scars as resistance—is consistent, deepened by backstory (censorship, the documentarian’s trust), and culminates in an Earned Stasis: she accepts ongoing risk to bear witness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail (trembling hands, red-lit focus). The final renunciation of safety is fully earned by prior causality.

    Theodora’s mechanical arm and philosophical stance are fused into a single, coherent identity; her contradictions—diplomatic yet fierce, patient yet proactive—are dramatized through micro-choices (e.g., catching Venn’s blade with copper fingers). Venn’s shifting mask reveals layered motivation without exposition. Both characters’ speech, posture, and tactics reflect distinct worldviews under pressure. The final renunciation (“waiting for questions to become destinations”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

    Solomon’s molting identity is embodied through tactile rituals (counting coins, handling letters) and culminates in a credible renunciation of shapeshifting survival—“Maybe I’ll stay Solomon”—that carries the weight of past losses. His contradiction (craving stability yet trained in transience) plays out in micro-choices: revealing the false bottom, mulching letters into soil. Marcus’s scars and seedlings ground his pressure as crucible, not foil. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in knuckles, rust, and dented canteens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his wistfulness and strategic creativity manifest in micro-choices (e.g., playing hidden compositions, threading the reel) rather than exposition. His contradictory impulses—longing for recognition yet crafting music “refusing to collapse into sentimentality”—act simultaneously. The final renunciation (“The world could listen or not”) feels earned by seventeen years of ignored performances, with the cost crystallized in the unfrozen clock. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail like trembling clock hands and silver leaves dissolving into mist.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “luminous doubt” and empirically whimsical faith reveal a character shaped by cognitive dissonance, not exposition. Her micro-choice to plant the seed despite uncertainty crystallizes her hierarchy of values: cultural truth over comfort. The emotional contradiction—scientific rigor versus ritual prayer—feels authentic under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; her struggle is dramatized through tactile action and sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—grief, anger, longing coexist without tidy resolution. Her micro-choice to turn away from her mother at sixteen is credibly flawed and shapes the entire emotional arc. Takeshi’s calm presence applies subtle pressure without dominating; his dialogue reveals character-specific wisdom rooted in craft (bonsai/lace). The final whisper of forgiveness feels earned through embodied realization, not diagnostic label-speak.
